<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>But</i> thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn <i>odours</i> for thee; and they will lament thee, <i>saying</i>, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="hdg">Freedom for Hebrew Slaves</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><i>This is</i> the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which <i>were</i> at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, <i>being</i> an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, <i>to wit</i>, of a Jew his brother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let <i>them</i> go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
