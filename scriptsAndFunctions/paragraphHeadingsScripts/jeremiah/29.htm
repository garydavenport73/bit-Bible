<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Build ye houses, and dwell <i>in them</i>; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that <i>be</i> in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them</i>; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which <i>are</i> in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?
