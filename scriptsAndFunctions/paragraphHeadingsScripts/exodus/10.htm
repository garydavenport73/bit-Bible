<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/exodus/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/exodus/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:
