<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And had taken the women captives, that <i>were</i> therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried <i>them</i> away, and went on their way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, <i>it was</i> burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David and the people that <i>were</i> with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Destroys the Amalekites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake <i>them</i>, and without fail recover <i>all</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So David went, he and the six hundred men that <i>were</i> with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And David said unto him, To whom <i>belongest</i> thou? and whence <i>art</i> thou? And he said, I <i>am</i> a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We made an invasion <i>upon</i> the south of the Cherethites, and upon <i>the coast</i> which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when he had brought him down, behold, <i>they were</i> spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then answered all the wicked men and <i>men</i> of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them <i>ought</i> of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead <i>them</i> away, and depart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
