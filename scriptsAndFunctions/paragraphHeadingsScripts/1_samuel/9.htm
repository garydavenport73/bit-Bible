<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he had a son, whose name <i>was</i> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and <i>there was</i> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <i>he was</i> higher than any of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found <i>them</i> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and <i>there they were</i> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found <i>them</i> not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>And</i> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that <i>was</i> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave <i>caring</i> for the asses, and take thought for us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said unto him, Behold now, <i>there is</i> in this city a man of God, and <i>he is</i> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <i>if</i> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and <i>there is</i> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <i>that</i> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <i>he that is</i> now <i>called</i> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God <i>was</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><i>And</i> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <i>he is</i> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for <i>there is</i> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <i>and</i> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they went up into the city: <i>and</i> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <i>to be</i> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house <i>is</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I <i>am</i> the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that <i>is</i> in thine heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <i>is</i> all the desire of Israel? <i>Is it</i> not on thee, and on all thy father's house? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Saul answered and said, <i>Am</i> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <i>were</i> about thirty persons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the cook took up the shoulder, and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> upon it, and set <i>it</i> before Saul. And <i>Samuel</i> said, Behold that which is left! set <i>it</i> before thee, <i>and</i> eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <i>Samuel</i> communed with Saul upon the top of the house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><i>And</i> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">King James Bible<br /><br />Text courtesy of <a href="http://www.bibleprotector.com/"> BibleProtector.com</a>.<br />Section Headings Courtesy <a href="http://bereanbible.com/">Berean Study Bible</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_samuel/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Samuel 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_samuel/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Samuel 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
