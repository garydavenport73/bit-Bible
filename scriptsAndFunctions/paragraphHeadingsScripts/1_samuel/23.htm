<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
