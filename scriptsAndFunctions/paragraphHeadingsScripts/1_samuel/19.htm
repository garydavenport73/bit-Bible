<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret <i>place</i>, and hide thyself: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou <i>art</i>, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest <i>it</i>, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
