<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Saul chose him three thousand <i>men</i> of Israel; <i>whereof</i> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <i>was</i> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of it</i>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And all Israel heard say <i>that</i> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <i>that</i> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <i>is</i> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And <i>some of</i> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he <i>was</i> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>
<p class="hdg">Saul's Unlawful Sacrifice</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <i>had appointed</i>: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="hdg">Samuel Rebukes Saul</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <i>that</i> thou camest not within the days appointed, and <i>that</i> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <i>to be</i> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <i>that</i> which the LORD commanded thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <i>that were</i> present with him, about six hundred men.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philistines Raid Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <i>that were</i> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way <i>that leadeth to</i> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And another company turned the way <i>to</i> Bethhoron: and another company turned <i>to</i> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel without Weapons</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <i>them</i> swords or spears: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
