<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:
