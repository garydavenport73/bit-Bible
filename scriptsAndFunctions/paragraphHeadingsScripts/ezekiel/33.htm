<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When I say unto the wicked, O wicked <i>man</i>, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Message of the Watchman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins <i>be</i> upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Say unto them, <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his <i>righteousness</i> in the day that he sinneth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When I shall say to the righteous, <i>that</i> he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

<p class="hdg">Explanation of Jerusalem's Fall</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth <i>month</i>, in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
