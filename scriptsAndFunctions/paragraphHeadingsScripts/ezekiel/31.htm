<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Behold, the Assyrian <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that <i>were</i> in the garden of God, envied him.</p>
