<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now consider how great this man <i>was</i>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <i>receiveth them</i>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus a Priest Like Melchizedek</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For he testifieth, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <i>did</i>; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And inasmuch as not without an oath <i>he was made priest</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But this <i>man</i>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For such an high priest became us, <i>who is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <i>maketh</i> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">King James Bible<br /><br />Text courtesy of <a href="http://www.bibleprotector.com/"> BibleProtector.com</a>.<br />Section Headings Courtesy <a href="http://bereanbible.com/">Berean Study Bible</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hebrews/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hebrews 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hebrews 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hebrews/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hebrews 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hebrews 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
