And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for <i>the sins of</i> the whole world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

<p class="hdg">A New Command</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.

<p class="hdg">Do Not Love the World</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Love not the world, neither the things <i>that are</i> in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_john/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For all that <i>is</i> in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
