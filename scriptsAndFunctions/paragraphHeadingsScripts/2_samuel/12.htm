<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The rich <i>man</i> had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this <i>thing</i> shall surely die: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Nathan said to David, Thou <i>art</i> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <i>that had been</i> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <i>to be</i> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
