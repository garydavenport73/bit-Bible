<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <i>thou art</i> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <i>it is</i> better that thou succour us out of the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <i>Deal</i> gently for my sake with the young man, <i>even</i> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <i>men</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <i>was</i> under him went away. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And a certain man saw <i>it</i>, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <i>him</i>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a girdle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver in mine hand, <i>yet</i> would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <i>touch</i> the young man Absalom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <i>me</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <i>was</i> yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <i>is</i> in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But howsoever, <i>said he</i>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>
