<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i>so</i>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i>art</i> thou? And he said, Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <i>are</i> good and right; but <i>there is</i> no man <i>deputed</i> of the king to hear thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it was <i>so</i>, that when any man came nigh <i>to him</i> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <i>that were</i> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, from his city, <i>even</i> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices.

<p class="hdg">David Flees Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And David said unto all his servants that <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <i>else</i> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <i>are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <i>which were</i> concubines, to keep the house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <i>art</i> a stranger, and also an exile. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Whereas thou camest <i>but</i> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <i>be</i> with thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Ittai answered the king, and said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, and <i>as</i> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <i>were</i> with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <i>were</i> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <i>both</i> it, and his habitation: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <i>here am</i> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <i>Art not</i> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Weeps at Mount Olivet</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And David went up by the ascent of <i>mount</i> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <i>was</i> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And <i>one</i> told David, saying, Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And it came to pass, that <i>when</i> David was come to the top <i>of the mount</i>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>have been</i> thy father's servant hitherto, so <i>will</i> I now also <i>be</i> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And <i>hast thou</i> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <i>that</i> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell <i>it</i> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
