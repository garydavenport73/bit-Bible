<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the victory that day was <i>turned</i> into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</p>
