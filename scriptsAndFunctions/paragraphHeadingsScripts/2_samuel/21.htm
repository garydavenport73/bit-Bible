<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, <i>that</i> will I do for you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us <i>that</i> we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell <i>all</i> seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first <i>days</i>, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
