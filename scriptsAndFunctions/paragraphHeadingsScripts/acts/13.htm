<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name <i>was</i> Barjesus:

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/13-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/13-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>For so hath the Lord commanded us, <i>saying</i>, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p>
