<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted <i>him</i> up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when Peter saw <i>it</i>, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <i>him</i> go.
