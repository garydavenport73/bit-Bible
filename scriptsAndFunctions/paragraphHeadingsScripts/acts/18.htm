<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <i>that</i> Jesus <i>was</i> Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <i>his</i> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <i>be</i> upon your own heads; I <i>am</i> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <i>man's</i> house, named Justus, <i>one</i> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if it be a question of words and names, and <i>of</i> your law, look ye <i>to it</i>; for I will be no judge of such <i>matters</i>.
