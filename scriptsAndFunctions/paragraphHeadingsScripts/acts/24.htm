<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <i>him</i>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>We accept <i>it</i> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For we have found this man <i>a</i> pestilent <i>fellow</i>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the chief captain Lysias came <i>upon us</i>, and with great violence took <i>him</i> away out of our hands, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Defends His Testimony</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <i>toward</i> men. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Or else let these same <i>here</i> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</p>
<p class="hdg">Felix Holds Paul in Custody</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <i>that</i> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">King James Bible<br /><br />Text courtesy of <a href="http://www.bibleprotector.com/"> BibleProtector.com</a>.<br />Section Headings Courtesy <a href="http://bereanbible.com/">Berean Study Bible</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
