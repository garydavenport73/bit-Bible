<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <i>men</i> glorified God for that which was done.
