<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use <i>them</i> despitefully, and to stone them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They were ware of <i>it</i>, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

<p class="hdg">The Visit to Lystra and Derbe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
