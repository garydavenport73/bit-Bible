And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <i>them</i> to prison.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philip in Samaria</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there was great joy in that city.</p>
<a name="9" id="9"></a><p class="hdg">Simon the Sorcerer<br /><p class="cross">(<a href="../deuteronomy/18.htm#9">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a>)</p></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philip and the Ethiopian</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Philip ran thither to <i>him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And as they went on <i>their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i>here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/8-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">King James Bible<br /><br />Text courtesy of <a href="http://www.bibleprotector.com/"> BibleProtector.com</a>.<br />Section Headings Courtesy <a href="http://bereanbible.com/">Berean Study Bible</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
