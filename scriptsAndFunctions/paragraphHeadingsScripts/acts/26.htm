Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Especially <i>because I know</i> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Unto which <i>promise</i> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <i>God</i> day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <i>them</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even unto strange cities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <i>it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Delivering thee from the people, and <i>from</i> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>To open their eyes, <i>and</i> to turn <i>them</i> from darkness to light, and <i>from</i> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <i>me</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>That Christ should suffer, <i>and</i> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="hdg">Festus Interrupts Paul's Defense</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/26-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">King James Bible<br /><br />Text courtesy of <a href="http://www.bibleprotector.com/"> BibleProtector.com</a>.<br />Section Headings Courtesy <a href="http://bereanbible.com/">Berean Study Bible</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/25.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 25"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 25" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/27.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 27"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 27" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
