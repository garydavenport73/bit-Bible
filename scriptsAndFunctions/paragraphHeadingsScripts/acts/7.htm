<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not <i>so much as</i> to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when <i>as yet</i> he had no child. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat <i>them</i> evil four hundred years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so <i>Abraham</i> begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac <i>begat</i> Jacob; and Jacob <i>begat</i> the twelve patriarchs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And at the second <i>time</i> Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send <i>to be</i> a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and <i>with</i> our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/acts/7-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</p>
