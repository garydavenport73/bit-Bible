<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <i>there is but</i> one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore <i>there is</i> no king, lord, nor ruler, <i>that</i> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And <i>it is</i> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the decree went forth that the wise <i>men</i> should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Dream Revealed to Daniel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why <i>is</i> the decree <i>so</i> hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast <i>now</i> made known unto us the king's matter.</p>
<p class="hdg">Daniel Interprets the Dream</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness <i>was</i> excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof <i>was</i> terrible.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
