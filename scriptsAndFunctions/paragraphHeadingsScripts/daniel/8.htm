<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <i>was</i> at Shushan <i>in</i> the palace, which <i>is</i> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <i>two</i> horns: and the <i>two</i> horns <i>were</i> high; but one <i>was</i> higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <i>was there any</i> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <i>had</i> a notable horn between his eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he came to the ram that had <i>two</i> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <i>land</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it waxed great, <i>even</i> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <i>some</i> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Yea, he magnified <i>himself</i> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <i>sacrifice</i> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And an host was given <i>him</i> against the daily <i>sacrifice</i> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <i>saint</i> which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>concerning</i> the daily <i>sacrifice</i>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I heard a man's voice between <i>the banks of</i> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <i>man</i> to understand the vision. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end <i>shall be</i> the vision.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
