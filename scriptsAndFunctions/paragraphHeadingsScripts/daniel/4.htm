<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom <i>is</i> the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, <i>saying</i>, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods <i>is</i> in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus <i>were</i> the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof <i>was</i> great.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This matter <i>is</i> by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen.
