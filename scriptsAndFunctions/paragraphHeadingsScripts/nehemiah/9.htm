<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest <i>them</i> from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</p>
