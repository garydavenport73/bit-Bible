<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, <i>and</i> to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which <i>is</i> Jerusalem; and <i>there were</i> with him two asses saddled, his concubine also <i>was</i> with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><i>And</i> when they <i>were</i> by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that <i>is</i> not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them <i>when they were</i> by Gibeah, which <i>belongeth</i> to Benjamin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they turned aside thither, to go in <i>and</i> to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for <i>there was</i> no man that took them into his house to lodging.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which <i>was</i> also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place <i>were</i> Benjamites.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man <i>which is</i> with thy servants: <i>there is</i> no want of any thing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the old man said, Peace <i>be</i> with thee; howsoever <i>let</i> all thy wants <i>lie</i> upon me; only lodge not in the street.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, <i>nay</i>, I pray you, do not <i>so</i> wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.
