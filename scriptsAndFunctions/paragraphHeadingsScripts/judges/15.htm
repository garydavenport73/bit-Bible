But her father would not suffer him to go in. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: <i>is</i> not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</p>
<p class="hdg">Samson Defeats the Philistines</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when he had set the brands on fire, he let <i>them</i> go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards <i>and</i> olives. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines <i>are</i> rulers over us? what <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done unto us?

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
