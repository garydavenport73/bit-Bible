<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><i>Namely</i>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</p>
<p class="hdg">Othniel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <i>even</i> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p>
<p class="hdg">Ehud Delivers the Israelites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that <i>were</i> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <i>his</i> seat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <i>were</i> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <i>them</i>: and, behold, their lord <i>was</i> fallen down dead on the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</p>
