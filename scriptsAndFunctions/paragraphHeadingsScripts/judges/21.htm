<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the people were numbered, and, behold, <i>there were</i> none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
