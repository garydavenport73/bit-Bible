<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? <i>Is</i> not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.
