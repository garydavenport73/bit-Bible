<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When they <i>were</i> by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this <i>place</i>? and what hast thou here? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/judges/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What <i>say</i> ye?
