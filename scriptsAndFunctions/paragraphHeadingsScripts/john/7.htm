<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
<p class="hdg">Is Jesus the Messiah?</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <i>man</i> hath done?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and <i>then</i> I go unto him that sent me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>What <i>manner of</i> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come?</p>
<p class="hdg">Living Water</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>In the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given</i>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>
<p class="hdg">Division of People over Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>So there was a division among the people because of him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Unbelief of the Jewish Leaders</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Doth our law judge <i>any</i> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/7-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
