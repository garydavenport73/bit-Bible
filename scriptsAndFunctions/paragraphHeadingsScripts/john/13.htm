<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, to betray him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also <i>my</i> hands and <i>my</i> head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
