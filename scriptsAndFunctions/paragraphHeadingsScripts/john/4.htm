<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he must needs go through Samaria. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <i>his</i> journey, sat thus on the well: <i>and</i> it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>God <i>is</i> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <i>him</i> in spirit and in truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <i>he</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Disciples Return and Marvel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i>ought</i> to eat? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <i>then</i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
<p class="hdg">Many Samaritans Believe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And many more believed because of his own word; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <i>him</i> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <i>him</i>, saying, Thy son liveth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/4-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
