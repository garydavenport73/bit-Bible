<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Some said, This is he: others <i>said</i>, He is like him: <i>but</i> he said, I am <i>he</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Pharisees Investigate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>These <i>words</i> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <i>or no</i>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i>it</i> again? will ye also be his disciples? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>We know that God spake unto Moses: <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow</i>, we know not from whence he is. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="hdg">Spiritual Sight and Blindness</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And <i>some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">King James Bible<br /><br />Text courtesy of <a href="http://www.bibleprotector.com/"> BibleProtector.com</a>.<br />Section Headings Courtesy <a href="http://bereanbible.com/">Berean Study Bible</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
