<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case</i>, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Father and the Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>That all <i>men</i> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/john/5-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
