<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <i>other</i> kine upon the brink of the river. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <i>it was</i> a dream. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <i>there was</i> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And <i>there was</i> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

<p class="hdg">Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <i>himself</i>, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <i>there is</i> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <i>that</i> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <i>is</i> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <i>is</i> about to do.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <i>is</i> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <i>it is</i> because the thing <i>is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/41-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
