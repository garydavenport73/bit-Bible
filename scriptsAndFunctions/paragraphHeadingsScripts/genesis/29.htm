<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he said, Lo, <i>it is</i> yet high day, neither <i>is it</i> time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go <i>and</i> feed <i>them</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and <i>till</i> they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.</p>
