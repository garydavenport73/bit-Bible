<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name <i>was</i> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/38-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/38-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When she <i>was</i> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <i>are, am</i> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <i>are</i> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
