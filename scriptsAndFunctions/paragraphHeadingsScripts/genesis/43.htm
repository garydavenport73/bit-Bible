<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if thou wilt not send <i>him</i>, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye <i>so</i> ill with me, <i>as</i> to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, <i>Is</i> your father yet alive? have ye <i>another</i> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <i>and</i> also our little ones. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And their father Israel said unto them, If <i>it must be</i> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry <i>it</i> again in your hand; peradventure it <i>was</i> an oversight:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved <i>of my children</i>, I am bereaved. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he said, Peace <i>be</i> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i>was</i> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he asked them of <i>their</i> welfare, and said, <i>Is</i> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <i>Is</i> he yet alive? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they answered, Thy servant our father <i>is</i> in good health, he <i>is</i> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, <i>Is</i> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <i>where</i> to weep; and he entered into <i>his</i> chamber, and wept there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/genesis/43-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And he took <i>and sent</i> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs.
