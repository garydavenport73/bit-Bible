<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they held their peace. And he took <i>him</i>, and healed him, and let him go;

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor <i>thy</i> rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/luke/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
