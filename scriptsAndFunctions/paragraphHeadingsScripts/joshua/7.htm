<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which <i>is</i> beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; <i>and</i> make not all the people to labour thither; for they <i>are but</i> few. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put <i>it</i> even among their own stuff.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, <i>that</i> the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families <i>thereof</i>; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger.
