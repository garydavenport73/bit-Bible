<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, <i>and</i> unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Offensive Altar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that <i>are</i> in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><i>Is</i> the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And if we have not <i>rather</i> done it for fear of <i>this</i> thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should <i>so</i> say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say <i>again</i>, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it <i>is</i> a witness between us and you.
