<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard <i>of it</i>, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he said unto them, Depart yet <i>for</i> three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, <i>and</i> which stood before him:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou <i>it</i> lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little <i>finger</i> shall be thicker than my father's loins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father <i>also</i> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But <i>as for</i> the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves <i>of</i> gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
