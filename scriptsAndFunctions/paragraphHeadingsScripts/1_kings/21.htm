<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it <i>is</i> near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; <i>or</i>, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee <i>another</i> vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/1_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, <i>and</i> eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>
