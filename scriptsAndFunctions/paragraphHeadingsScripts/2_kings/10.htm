And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's <i>children</i>, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons <i>are</i> with you, and <i>there are</i> with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set <i>him</i> on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he that <i>was</i> over the house, and he that <i>was</i> over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up <i>of the children</i>, sent to Jehu, saying, We <i>are</i> thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou <i>that which is</i> good in thine eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye <i>be</i> mine, and <i>if</i> ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, <i>being</i> seventy persons, <i>were</i> with the great men of the city, which brought them up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him <i>them</i> to Jezreel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye <i>be</i> righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done <i>that</i> which he spake by his servant Elijah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, <i>even</i> two and forty men; neither left he any of them.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed <i>it</i>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he said unto him that <i>was</i> over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, <i>If</i> any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, <i>he that letteth him go</i>, his life <i>shall be</i> for the life of him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, <i>and</i> slay them; let none come forth.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
