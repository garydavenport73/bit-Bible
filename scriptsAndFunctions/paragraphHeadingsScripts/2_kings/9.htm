(Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, <i>then</i> let none go forth <i>nor</i> escape out of the city to go to tell <i>it</i> in Jezreel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, <i>Is it</i> peace? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, <i>Is it</i> peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, <i>Is it</i> peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving <i>is</i> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, <i>Is it</i> peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts <i>are so</i> many? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, <i>There is</i> treachery, O Ahaziah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then said <i>Jehu</i> to Bidkar his captain, Take up, <i>and</i> cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw <i>this</i>, he fled by the way of the garden house.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</p>
