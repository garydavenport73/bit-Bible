<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as <i>he had done</i> year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel Exiled Because of Idolatry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For <i>so</i> it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as <i>did</i> the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that <i>were</i> round about them, <i>concerning</i> whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, <i>even</i> two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And <i>so</i> it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, <i>that</i> they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew <i>some</i> of them.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_kings/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put <i>them</i> in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
