<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, <i>even</i> the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them <i>was written</i> according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, <i>that</i> the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, <i>even</i> the tables of the covenant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted <i>themselves</i>; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <i>is</i> a stiffnecked people: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant <i>were</i> in my two hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, <i>and</i> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, <i>and</i> ground <i>it</i> very small, <i>even</i> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
