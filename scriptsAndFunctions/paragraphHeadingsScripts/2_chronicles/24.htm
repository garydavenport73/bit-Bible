Howbeit the Levites hastened <i>it</i> not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, <i>according to the commandment</i> of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <i>there was</i> much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
