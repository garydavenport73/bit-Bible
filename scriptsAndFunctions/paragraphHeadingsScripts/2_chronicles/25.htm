<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

<p class="hdg">Amaziah's Victories</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of <i>their</i> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice <i>men, able</i> to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD <i>is</i> not with Israel, <i>to wit, with</i> all the children of Ephraim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But if thou wilt go, do <i>it</i>, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.

<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Amaziah separated them, <i>to wit</i>, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

<p class="hdg">Amaziah Rebuked for Idolatry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up <i>to be</i> his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that <i>the king</i> said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?
