<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these <i>were</i> the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he <i>was</i> the firstborn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and <i>divers</i> also of the princes of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jehoram <i>was</i> thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought <i>that which was</i> evil in the eyes of the LORD.
