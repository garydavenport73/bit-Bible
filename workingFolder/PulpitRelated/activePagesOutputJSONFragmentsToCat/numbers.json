The command to make the silver trumpets is introduced here, because one principal use of them was connected with the order of march. It does not necessarily, follow that the command was actually given exactly at this time, or that all the different directions for use formed part of one communication. They may have been gathered together for convenience sake. See the Introduction on this subject. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that this use of trumpets has been anticipated in Leviticus 25:9, or elsewhere, for the \"trumpets\" there mentioned were altogether different in shape, as in material.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Make thee two trumpets. Hebrew, khatsotserah. From the testimony of Josephus, from the representation on the arch of Titus, and from a comparison of ancient Egyptian trumpets, it is clear that these trumpets were straight, long, and narrow, with an expanded mouth. The shophar, or trumpet of the Jubilee, on the other hand, was a buccina or cornet, either made of a ram's horn, or shaped like one. Of a whole piece. Rather, \"of beaten work.\" Hebrew, mikshah (see on Exodus 25:18). Septuagint, ἐλατὰς ποιήσεις αὐτάς. Probably they were made of a single plate of silver beaten out into the required shape, which was very simple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When they shall blow with them, i.e., with both of them.

Hebrew, תְּרוּעָה. This seems to signify a continuous peal, easily distinguished, wherever audible, from the blowing in short, sharp tones (Hebrew, תָּקַע) mentioned below, verse 7. The peal of alarm was to be blown - לְמַסְּעֵיהֶם - \"for their breaking up\" - for that purpose, and no other. The camps. Only those on the east (Judah, with Issachar and Zebulun) and on the south (Reuben, with Simeon and Gad) are here mentioned. It may be that the silver trumpets themselves were carried with the sacred utensils after the southern camps, and that some other means were employed to start the remaining tribes; or it may be that the omission is due to some accidental circumstance. The Septuagint inserts in verse 6, \"And ye shall sound a third alarm, and the camps which are pitched westwards shall move; and ye shall sound a fourth alarm, and the camps which are pitched northwards shall move.\" No doubt this was the actual order of starting, however the signal was given.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow. It was natural that they should be made responsible for the custody and use of these trumpets, not because their sound represented the voice of God, but because they were used for religious purposes, and could only be safely kept in the sanctuary. An ordinance forever. The accustomed formula for some sacred institution which was to have a permanent character and an eternal meaning (cf. Exodus 12:24). The truth of these words cannot be exhausted by an actual use of 1500 years, followed by complete disuse for 1800 years. The \"ordinance\" of the silver trumpets must be perpetuated \"forever\" in the gospel, or else the Divine word has failed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If ye go to war. בּוא מִלחָמָה, \"come into war,\" or \"be engaged,\" denoting actual hostilities. In your land. The practical use of the trumpets ceased with the years of wandering; the ceremonial use was continued as long as the people dwelt in \"their land;\" the spiritual use remains an \"ordinance for ever,\" as long as the Church is militant here on earth. That the use of the two silver trumpets was ceremonial, and not practical, after the conquest of Canaan is evident from the purpose and effect ascribed to that use. Whether in war or in worship, that purpose was not to convoke the people, nor to give signals to the host, but to put God in mind of his promises, and to invoke his covenanted grace. Indeed, two trumpets, as here prescribed, could not be otherwise than ceremonially used after the nation was spread abroad over the whole face of Canaan; and there is no direction to make more than two such trumpets. The use of trumpets in subsequent times is indeed often mentioned both in war and in holy festivities, and it was undoubtedly founded upon this Divine ordinance; but it was not in literal compliance with it, for the obvious reason that many trumpets were used instead of two only (see 1 Chronicles 15:24; 2 Chronicles 5:12; Nehemiah 12:35). In these passages (and probably in 2 Chronicles 13:12) we have abundant evidence of one of those expansions and adaptations of the Mosaic ritual which were so freely made under the house of David. Chapter 31:6, and (perhaps) 1 Chronicles 16:6, and Psalm 81:3 may be quoted as pointing to the strict fulfillment of the law as it stands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In the day of your gladness. Any day of national thanksgiving, celebrated with religious services, as the feast of the dedication (John 10:22) or of Purim (Esther 9:19, sqq.). In your solemn days. מועַדים. The feasts appointed to be observed by the law (see chapters 28, and 29.). In the beginnings of your months. New moon days (Psalm 81:3). Only the first day of the seventh month was properly a feast (Leviticus 23:24), but all were distinguished by special sacrifices (chapter 28:11).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:11-28 THE ORDER OF MARCH FROM SINAI (verses 11-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - On the twentieth day of the second month. This answered approximately to our May 6th, when the spring verdure would still be on the land, but the heat of the day would already have become intense. We may well suppose that the departure would have taken place a month earlier, had it not been necessary to wait for the due celebration of the second or supplemental passover (Numbers 9:11). As this march was, next to the actual exodus, the great trial of Israel's faith and obedience, it was most important that none should commence it otherwise than in full communion with their God and with one another. The cloud was taken up. For the first time since the tabernacle had been reared up (Exodus 40:34). This being the Divine signal for departure, the silver trumpets would immediately announce the fact to all the hosts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Took their journeys. Literally, \"marched according to their journeys\" לְמַסְּעֵיהֶם. Septuagint, τίαις αὐτῶν, set forward with their baggage. And the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. Taken by itself this would seem to apply to the first resting of the cloud and the first halt of the host after breaking up from \"the wilderness of Sinai.\" It appears, however, from Numbers 12:16 that \"the wilderness of Paran\" was fully reached after leaving Hazeroth at the end of three days' journey from Sinai, nor would a shorter space of time suffice to carry the host across the mountain barrier of the Jebel et-Tih, which forms the clearly-marked southern limit of the desert plateau of Paran (see next note). Some critics have arbitrarily extended the limits of \"the wilderness of Paran\" so as to include the sandy waste between Sinai and the Jebel et-Tih, and therefore the very first halting-place of Israel. This, however, is unnecessary as well as arbitrary; forNEWLINENEWLINE(1) verses 12, 13 are evidently in the nature of a summary, and the same subject is confessedly taken up again in verse 33, sq.; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the departure from Sinai is expressly said to have been for a \"three days' journey\" (verse 33), which must mean that the march, although actually divided into three stages, was regarded as a single journey, because it brought them to their immediate destination in the wilderness of Paran. Here then is a plain reason for the statement in this verse: the cloud did indeed rest twice between the two wildernesses, but only so as to allow of a night's repose, not so as to break the continuity of the march. \"The wilderness of Paran.\" Septuagint, ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ φαράν. This geographical expression is nowhere exactly defined in Holy Scripture, and the name itself has disappeared; for in spite of the resemblance in sound (a resemblance here, as in so many cases, wholly delusive), it seems to have no connection whatever with the Wady Feiran, the fertile valley at the base of Serbal, or with the town which once shared the name. All the allusions, however, in the Old Testament to Paran point to a district so clearly marked out, so deeply stamped with its own characteristics, by nature, that no mistake is possible. This district is now called et-Tih, i.e., the wandering, and is still remembered in the traditions of the Arabs as the scene of the wanderings of the people of God. Little known, and never thoroughly explored, its main features are nevertheless unmistakable, and its boundaries sharply defined. Measuring about 150 miles in either direction, its southern frontier (now called the Jebel et-Tih) is divided by the broad sandy waste of er-Ramleh from the Sinaitic mountains and the Sinaitic peninsula properly so called; its northern mountain mass looks across the deep fissure of the Wady Murreh (or desert of Zin), some ten or fifteen miles broad, into er-Rachmah, the mountain of the Amorite, the southern extension of the plateau of Judah; on the east it fails abruptly down to the narrow beach of the Elanite Gulf, and to the Arabah; on the west alone it sinks slowly into the sandy desert of Shur, which separates it from the Mediterranean and from Egypt. Et-Tih is itself divided into nearly equal halves, by the Wady el Arish (or \"river of Egypt\"), which, rising on the northern slopes of the Jebel et-Tih, and running northwards through the whole plateau, turns off to the west and is lost in the desert of Shur. That the western half of the plateau went also under the name of Paran is evident from the history of Ishmael (see especially Genesis 21:21; Genesis 25:18), but it was through the eastern portion alone that the wanderings of the Israelites, so far as we can trace them, lay. This \"wilderness of Paran\" is indeed \"a great and terrible wilderness\" (Deuteronomy 1:9), lacking for the most part the precipitous grandeur of the granite mountains of Sinai, but lacking also their fertile valleys and numerous streams. A bare limestone or sandstone plateau, crossed by low ranges of hills, seamed with innumerable dry water-courses, and interspersed with large patches of sand and gravel, is what now meets the eye of the traveler in this forsaken land. It is true that a good deal of rain falls at times, and that when it does fall vegetation appears with surprising rapidity and abundance; it is true also that the district has been persistently denuded of trees and shrubs for the sake of fuel. But whatever mitigations may have then existed, it is clear from the Bible itself that the country was then, as now, emphatically frightful (cf. Deuteronomy 1:19; Deuteronomy 8:15; Deuteronomy 32:10; Jeremiah 2:6). Something may be set, no doubt, to the account of rhetoric, and much may be allowed for variety of seasons. Even in Australia the very same district will appear at one time like the desolation of a thousand years, and in the very next year it will blossom as the rose. But at certain seasons at any rate et-Tih was (as it is) a \"howling\" wilderness, where the dreadful silence of a lifeless land was only broken by the nightly howling of unclean beasts who tracked the footsteps of the living in order to devour the carcasses of the dead. Perhaps so bad a country has never been attempted by any army in modern days, even by the Russian troops in Central Asia. Amongst the many Wadys which drain the uncertain rain-fall of the eastern half of et-Tih (and at the same time testify to a greater rain-fall in bygone ages), the most important is the Wady el Terafeh, which, also rising on the northern slopes of Jebel et-Tih, runs northwards and north-westwards, and finally opens into the Arabah. Towards its northern limit et-Tih changes its character for the worse. Here it rises into a precipitous quadrilateral of mountains, about forty miles square, not very lofty, but exceedingly steep and rugged, composed in great measure of dazzling masses of bare chalk or limestone, which glow as in a furnace beneath the summer sun. This mountain mass, now called the Azaimat, or mountain country of the Azazimeh, rising steeply from the rest of the plateau to the southward, is almost completely detached by deep depressions from the surrounding districts; at the north-west corner alone it is united by a short range of mountains with er-Rachmah, and so with the highlands of Southern Palestine. From this corner the Wady Murreh descends broad and deep towards the cast, forking at the eastern extremity towards the Arabah on the southeast, and towards the Dead Sea on the north. east. The interior of this inaccessible country has yet to be really explored, and it is the scanty nature of our present knowledge concerning it which, more than anything else, prevents us from following with any certainty the march of the Israelites as recorded in this book.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And they first took their journey. The meaning of this is somewhat doubtful. The Septuagint has ἐξῇραν πρῶτοι, the foremost set out; the Vulgate, profecti sunt per turmas suas. Perhaps it means, \"they journeyed in the order of precedence\" assigned to them by their marching orders in chapter 2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - According to their armies. In each camp, and under each of the four standards, there were three tribal hosts, each an army in itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And the tabernacle was taken down. That is, the fabric of it; the boards, curtains, and other heavy portions which were packed upon the six wagons provided for the purpose (Numbers 7:5-9). And the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward. Between the first and second divisions of the host. In chapter 2 it had been directed in general terms that \"the tabernacle\" should set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the host, between the second and third divisions. At that time the duties of the several Levitical families had not been specified, and the orders for the taking down and transport of the tabernacle and its furniture had not been given in detail. It would be historically an error, and theologically a superstition, to imagine that Divine commands such as these had no elasticity, and left no room for adaptation, under the teaching of experience, or for the sake of obvious convenience. Whether the present modification was directly commanded by God himself, or whether it was made on the authority of Moses, does not here appear. There can be no question that subsequent theocratic rulers of Israel claimed and used a large liberty in modifying the Divinely-originated ritual and order. Compare the case of the passover, the arrangements of Solomon's temple as corresponding with those of the tabernacle, and even the use of the silver trumpets. The Septuagint has the future tense here, καθελοῦσι τὴν σκηνήν κ.τ.λ. as if to mark it as a fresh command.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The sanctuary.

Literally, \"the collector,\" or \"the gatherer, of all the camps.\" The word is applied by Isaiah to God himself (Isaiah 52:12; Isaiah 58:8) as to him that \"gathereth the outcasts of Israel.\" Dan may have been the collector of all the camps simply in the sense that his host closed in all the others from behind, and in pitching completed the full number. Under any ordinary circumstances, however (see next note) the work of the rear-guard in collecting stragglers and in taking charge of such as had fainted by the way must have been arduous and important in the extreme.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Thus were the journeyings. Rather, \"these were the journeyings,\" the marchings of the various hosts of which the nation was composed. The question may here be asked, which is considered more at large in the Introduction, how it was possible for a nation of more than two million souls, containing the usual proportion of aged people, women, and children, to march as here represented, in compact columns closely following one another, without straggling, without confusion, without incalculable suffering and loss of life. That the line of march was intended to be compact and unbroken is plain (amongst other things) from the directions given about the tabernacle. The fabric was sent on in advance with the evident intent that it should be reared up and ready to receive the holy things by the time they arrived. Yet between the fabric and the furniture there marched more than half a million of people (the camp of Reuben), all of whom had to reach the camping ground and turn off to the right before the Kohathites could rejoin their brethren. Now discipline and drill will do wonders in the way of ordering and expediting the movements even of vast multitudes, if they are thoroughly under control; the family organization also of the tribes, and the long leisure which they had enjoyed at Sinai, gave every opportunity of perfecting the necessary discipline. But it is clear that no discipline could make such an arrangement as the one above mentioned feasible under the ordinary circumstances of human life. It would be absolutely necessary to eliminate all the casualties and all the sicknesses which would naturally clog and hinder the march of such a multitude, in order that it might be compressed within the required limits of time and space. Have we any ground for supposing that these casualties and sicknesses were eliminated? In answering this question we must clearly distinguish between the journey from Sinai to Kadesh, on the borders of Palestine, which was a journey of only eleven days (Deuteronomy 1:2), and the subsequent wanderings of the people of Israel. It is the eleven days' journey only with which we are concerned, because it was for this journey only that provision was made and orders were given by the God of Israel. During the subsequent years of wandering and of excommunication, there can be no doubt that the marching orders fell into abeyance as entirely as the sacrificial system and the rite of circumcision itself. During these years the various camps may have scattered themselves abroad, marched, and halted very much as the circumstances of the day demanded. But that this was not and could not be the case during the short journey which should have landed them in Canaan is obvious from the whole tone, as well as from the particular details, of the commandments considered above. It is further to be borne in mind that the Divine promise and undertaking at the exodus was, impliedly if not explicitly, to bring the whole people, one and all, small and great, safely to their promised home. When the Psalmist asserts (Psalm 105:37) that \"there was not one feeble person among their tribes,\" he does not go beyond what is plainly intimated in the narrative. If of their cattle \"not an hoof\" must be left behind, lest the absolute character of the deliverance be marred, how much more necessary was it that not a soul be abandoned to Egyptian vengeance? And how could all depart unless all were providentially saved from sickness and infirmity? But the same necessity (the necessity of his own goodness) held good when the exodus was accomplished. God could not bring any individual in Israel out of Egypt only to perish in the wilderness, unless it were through his own default, he who had brought them out with so lavish a display of miraculous power was (we may say with reverence) bound also to bring them in; else they had been actual losers by obedience, and his word had not been kept to them. Under a covenant and a dispensation which assuredly did not look one hand's breadth beyond the present life, it must have seemed to be of the essence of the promise which they believed that not one of them should die or have to be left behind. And as the death or loss of one of God's people would have vitiated the temporal promise to thegn, so also it would have vitiated the eternal promise to us. For they were ensamples of us, and confessedly what was done for them was done at least as much for our sakes as for theirs. Now the promise of God is manifest unto every one that is included within his new covenant, viz., to bring him safely at last unto the heavenly Canaan, and that in spite of every danger, if only he do not draw back. The whole analogy, therefore, and the typical meaning of the exodus would be overthrown if any single Israelite who had crossed the Red Sea failed to enter into rest, save as the consequence of his own sin. We conclude, therefore, with some confidence that the ordinary incidents of mortality were providentially excluded from the present march, as from the previous interval; that none fell sick, none became helpless, none died a natural death. We know that the great difficulty of a sufficient supply of food was miraculously met; we know that in numberless respects the passage from Egypt to Canaan was hedged about with supernatural aids. Is there any difficulty in supposing that he who gave them bread to eat and water to drink, who led them by a cloudy and a fiery pillar, could also give them health and strength to \"walk and not be weary\"? Is it unreasonable to imagine that he who spake in his tender pity of the flight from Judaea to Pella, \"Woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days,\" miraculously restrained for that season the natural increase of his people?NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:29-32 THE INVITATION TO HOBAB (verses 29-32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Hobab, the sou of Raguel (or rather Reuel, of which Raguel is simply the Septuagint and Vulgate variation), Moses' father-in-law. It is not quite certain who this \"Hobab\" was. The name occurs only here and in Judges 4:11. The older opinion, followed by the A.V., identified Hobab with Jethro, and Jethro with Reuel the \"priest of Midian,\" and father of Zipporah, Moses' wife. It is, of course, no real objection to this opinion that Hobab is here called the \"son of Reuel;\" for the name may quite well have been an hereditary one, like Abimelech and so many others. Nor need the multiplicity of names given to one individual astonish us, for it is of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament, and not infrequent in the New. The father-in-law of Moses was a priest, holding (probably by right of birth) the patriarchal dignity of tribal priest, as Job did on a smaller, and Melchizedec on a larger, scale. He may very well, therefore, have had one or more \"official\" names in addition to his personal name. If this is accepted, then it may serve as one instance amongst many to remind us how extremely careless the inspired writers are about names - \"careless\" not in the sense of not caring whether they are right or wrong, but in the sense of not betraying and not feeling the least anxiety to avoid the appearance and suspicion of inaccuracy. Even in the lists of the twelve apostles we arc forced to believe that \"Judas the brother of James\" is the same person as \"Lebbaeus\" and \"Thaddaeus;\" and it is a matter of endless discussion whether or no \"Bartholomew\" was the same as \"Nathanael.\" On the face of it Scripture proclaims that it uses no arts, that it takes no pains to preserve an appearance of accuracy - that appearance which is so easily simulated for the purposes of falsehood. Holy Scripture may therefore fairly claim to be read without that captiousness, without that demand for minute carefulness and obvious consistency, which we rightly apply to one of our own histories. The modern historian avowedly tells his story as a witness does in the presence of a hostile counsel; the sacred historian tells his as a man does to the children round his knee. Surely such an obvious fact should disarm a good deal of the petty criticism which carps at the sacred narrative. Many, however, will think that the balance of probability is against the older opinion. It is certain that the word translated \"father-in-law\" has no such definiteness either in the Hebrew or in the Septuagint. It means simply a \"marriage relation,\" and is even used by Zipporah of Moses himself (Exodus 4:25, 26 - Hebrew. The Septuagint avoids the word). It is just as likely to mean \"brother-in-law\" when applied to Hobab. As Moses was already eighty years old when Jethro is first mentioned (Exodus 3:1), it may seem probable that his father-in-law was by that time dead, and succeeded in his priestly office by his eldest son. In that case Hobab would be a younger son of Reuel, and as such free to leave the home of his ancestors and to join himself to his sister's people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. It is an obvious conclusion, from the reasons here urged by Moses, that the many and wonderful promises of Divine guidance and Divine direction did not supersede in his eyes the use of all available human aids. It is not indeed easy to say where any room was left for the good offices and experience of Hobab; the cloud of the Divine Presence seemed to control absolutely the journeying and encamping of the people; yet if we really knew in detail the actual ordering of that wondrous march, we should doubtless find that the heavenly guidance did but give unity and certainty to all the wisdom, caution, and endeavour of its earthly leaders. Indeed if we recall to mind that the host is calculated at more than two millions of people, it is quite evident that even during the march to Kadesh (and much more in the long wanderings which followed) it must have been extremely difficult to keep the various divisions together. In the broken and difficult country which they were to traverse, which had been familiar to Hobab from his youth, there would be scope enough for all his ability as a guide. And it would seem that it was just this prospect of being really useful to the people of Israel that prevailed with Hobab. He must indeed have felt assured that a wonderful future awaited a nation whose past and present were, even within his own knowledge, so wonderful. But that alone could not move him to leave his own land and his own kindred, a firing so unspeakably repugnant to the feelings and traditions of his age and country. Doubtless to the child of the desert, whose life was a never-ending struggle with the dangers and vicissitudes of the wilderness, the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, watered with the rain of heaven, seemed like the garden of Eden. Yet the offer of an heritage within that land moved him not so much, it would appear, as the claim upon his own good offices in helping the chosen people to reach their own abode. The Septuagint translation, or rather paraphrase, of this verse is, \"Leave us not, forasmuch as thou wast with us in the wilderness, and thou shalt be an elder among us.\" This seems, on the one hand, to identify Hobab with Jethro; on the other, to imply that he was shortly afterwards one of the seventy elders upon whom the spirit came. This, however, is not likely. Hobab does indeed seem to have gone with the people, but his descendants were not incorporated into Israel; they were with them, but not of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - If thou go with us. From Judges 1:16 we learn that the sons of Hobab joined themselves to the sons of Judah, and dwelt amongst them on the southern border of the land. Here is an \"undesigned coincidence,\" albeit a slight one. Judah led the way on the march from Sinai to Canaan, and Hobab's duties as guide and scout would bring him more into contact with that tribe than with any other.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:33-36 THE ACTUAL DEPARTURE FROM SINAI (verses 33-36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - And they departed. These words mark the moment of actual departure, which has been anticipated in the general statement of verse 12. It was one of the supreme moments in the life of Israel - one of those beginnings or \"departures\" which lead to untold gain or loss; it was, in fact, although they knew it not, the commencement of a march which for almost all of them should know no end except within a hasty grave. No doubt, during the months spent at Sinai, every preparation had been made for the onward journey; but none the less it was a stupendous enterprise to march that vast host, so largely composed of women and children, so little inured to such fatigue, and so impatient of such discipline, for three consecutive days into a wilderness. Three days' journey. This expression is apparently a general one, and not to be strictly pressed (cf. Genesis 30:36; Exodus 3:18; Exodus 15:22). At the same time it impliesNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the host twice halted for the night during the journey, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the whole journey was regarded as one and in some sense as complete in itself.NEWLINENEWLINEThe terminus ad quem of this three days' journey is given us in verse 12; it was to take them across the intervening belt of sand, and to land them fairly within the \"wilderness of Paran.\" During this journey no doubt the march would be pushed on as steadily as possible, but it is not likely that it would cover so much as thirty miles. A modern army, unencumbered with non-combatants, does not make more than ten miles a day over difficult country, nor can cattle be driven faster than that. Even to accomplish that rate, and to keep the whole multitude together, as the narrative implies, required supernatural aid and strength. For the direction of the march see notes on chapter 13. The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them. It is obvious that what is apparently affirmed here is apparently at variance with Numbers 2:17 and verse 21 of this chapter, which speak of the holy things - of which the ark was the most holy - as carried by the Kohathites in the very midst of the long line of march. Three opinions have been held on the subject.NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the ark was really carried with the other \"holy things,\" and only \"went before\" metaphorically, as a general may be said to lead his troops, although he may not be actually in front of them; to which it is obvious to reply that if the ark did not actually precede the host, there was no possible way in which it could direct their movements; the cloud alone would be the visible expression of the Divine guidance.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the \"holy things\" generally were ordered to be carried in the midst of the host by the Kohathites, but that God reserved the place of the ark itself to his own immediate disposition. A general does not include himself in his own marching orders, however minute; and the ark was the outward symbol of God's own personal presence and guidance. It is, therefore, not at all surprising that the first intimation of the position of the ark on the march should be given at the moment when the march actually commenced.NEWLINENEWLINE3. That the usual place for the ark was no doubt with the sanctuary, as implied in the orders, but that o a this special occasion the ark went to the front in consequence of some Divine intimation, just as it did at the crossing of Jordan and at the taking of Jericho. Certainly there is much reason in this view, considering how momentous and formidable was their first assay at marching from their temporary home towards that unknown land beyond the northern horizon. If the deep waters of Jordan might fright them, or the walls of Jericho defy them, well might they shrink from plunging into the broken, stony, and intractable country into which the ark and the cloud now led them. We shall probably think that either habitually or at least occasionally the ark did go before, and that the feet of them that bare it were supernaturally directed, either by the movements of the cloud, or by some more secret intimation, towards the destined place of rest. It is allowed by all that the cloud preceded and directed the march, and it would be strange indeed if these twin symbols of the Divine presence had been so far separated from one another; for the accustomed place of the cloud was above the tabernacle, i.e., above the ark, yet outside of the tabernacle, so as to be visible to all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The cloud of the Lord was upon them by day. It would seem as if the cloud, which was luminous by night, dense and dark by day, spread itself upwards and backwards from over the ark, overshadowing the host as it followed - a refreshment at any rate to those who were near, perhaps to all, and a guiding beacon to those who were afar. To what extent the people at large were able to enjoy this shade amidst the burning heats of the desert we cannot possibly tell, but there is no doubt that it dwelt in the memory of the nation, and gave meaning to such expressions as the \"shadow of the Almighty\" (Psalm 91:1), and \"the shadow of a cloud\" (Isaiah 25:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - When the ark set forward. These words, taken in connection with the words \"when it rested,\" in the following verse, confirm the belief that at this time (at any rate) the ark went before the host; for if it had remained in the midst, it would not have stirred until half the tribes had moved off, nor would it have halted until half the camp was pitched, whereas it is evident that its setting forward and standing still were the decisive moments of the day. They had, as it were, a sacramental character; they were visible signs, corresponding to invisible realities, as the movements of the hands on the dial correspond to the action of the machinery within. When the ark and the cloud set forward, it was the Almighty God going on before to victory; when the ark and the cloud rested, it was the all-merciful God returning to protect and cherish his own. This is clearly recognized in the morning and evening prayer of Moses. The typical and spiritual character of that setting forward and that resting could not well have been lost upon any religious mind - that God going before us is the certain and abiding pledge of final victory, that God returning to us is the only hope of present safety. Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered. The sixty-eighth Psalm, which we have learnt to associate with the wonders of Pentecost and the triumphs of the Church on earth, seems to be an expansion of Moses' morning prayer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers10:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands (literally, myriad thousands; see Numbers 1:16) of Israel. שׁוּבָה being construed with the accusative is of somewhat doubtful interpretation. It may be as in the beautiful and familiar rendering of the A.V., than which nothing could be more obviously in harmony with the circumstances, and the feelings which gave rise to the prayer. Or it may be necessary to translate it by a transitive verb, and then it will be either, with many moderns, \"Restore, O Lord, the myriad thousands of Israel,\" i.e., to their promised home; or, with the Septuagint, \"Convert, O Lord (ἐπίστρεφε, Κύριε), the thousand myriads of Israel.\" If the ordinary reading be (as it appears) grammatically defensible, it is unquestionably to be preferred. Only Moses, as he looked upon that huge multitude covering the earth far and wide, could rightly feel how unutterably awful their position would be if on any day the cloud were to rise and melt into the evening sky instead of poising itself above the sanctuary of Israel. The Septuagint transposes verse 34 from its proper place to the end of the chapter, apparently in order to keep together the verses which speak of the movements of the ark. Many Hebrew MSS. mark verses 35, 36 with inverted nuns, נ, but the explanations given are fanciful, and the meaning uncertain.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord. There is no \"when\" in the original. It is literally, \"And the people were as complainers evil in the ears of the Lord.\" This may be paraphrased as in the A.V.; or it may be rendered as in the Septuagint, ῆν ὁ λαὸς γογγύζων πονηρὰ ἔυαντι κυρίου (cf. 1 Corinthians 10:10), where πονηρά means the wicked things they uttered in their discontent; or the \"evil\" may mean the hardships they complained cf. The Targums understand it in the same way as the Septuagint, and this seems to agree best with the context. As to the time and place of this complaining, the narrative seems to limit it within the three days' march from the wilderness of Sinai; but it is not possible to fix it more precisely. It is sufficient that the very first incident in the great journey thought worthy of record was this sin and its punishment, and the natural conclusion is that it came to pass very shortly after the departure. As to the reason of the complaining, although it is not stated, and although there does not seem to have been any special cause of distress, we can hardly be mistaken about it. The fatigue and anxiety of the march, after a year's comparative idleness, the frightful nature of the country into which they were marching, and the unknown terrors of the way which lay before them, these were quite enough to shake their nerves and upset their minds. Such things could only be borne and faced in a spirit of faith and trustful dependence upon God and their appointed leaders, and that spirit they knew nothing cf. Slavery, even when its outward pressure is past and gone like a bad dream, leaves behind it above all things an incurable suspicion of, and a rooted disbelief in, others, which shows itself outwardly by blank ingratitude and persistent complaint of bad treatment. This is the well-known mental attitude of liberated slaves even towards their benefactors and liberators; and in the case of Israel this temper extended to the King of Israel himself, whom they held responsible for all the privations and terrors of an apparently needless journey through a hideous waste. The Targum of Palestine says here, \"There were wicked men of the people who, being discontent, devised and imagined evil before the Lord.\" The complaining, however, seems to have been general throughout the host, as the Psalmist more truly acknowledges (Psalm 78:17-22). And the fire of the Lord burnt among them. The \"fire of the Lord\" may mean one of three things.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Lightning, as apparently in Job 1:16; for lightning to the unscientific is the fiery bolt, even as thunder is the angry voice, of God (cf. 1 Samuel 12:18, 19).NEWLINENEWLINE2. A miraculous outburst of flame from the Presence in the tabernacle, such as slew Nadab and Abihu (Leviticus 10:2), and afterwards the 250 men who offered incense (chapter 16:35).NEWLINENEWLINE3. A miraculous descent of fire from heaven, as apparently in 2 Kings 1:10-12 (cf. Revelation 13:13). Of these the second seems to be excluded by the fact that the conflagration was in the outskirts of the camp furthest removed from the tabernacle. If we suppose the fire to have been natural, we may further suppose that it set alight to the dry bushes and shrubs which abound in parts of the desert, and which blaze with great fury when the flame is driven by the wind. It is, however, at least as likely that a wholly supernatural visitation of God is here intended. What is most important to notice is this, that the punishment in this case followed hard and sore upon the sin, whereas before they came to Sinai the Lord had passed over similar murmurings without any chastisement (Exodus 15:24; Exodus 16:2). The reason of this difference was twofold. In the first place, they had now had abundant opportunity to become acquainted with the power and goodness of the Lord, and had solemnly entered into covenant with him, and he had taken up his abode among them; wherefore their responsibilities grew with their privileges, their dangers kept pace with their advantages. In the second place, they had while at Sinai committed an act of national apostasy (Exodus 32), the punishment of which, although suspended (verse 14), was only suspended (verse 34), and was always capable of being revived; Israel was plainly warned that he was under sentence, and that any disobedience would awake the terrors of the Lord against him. And consumed... in the uttermost parts of the camp. Probably setting fire to the outer line of tents, or some pitched outside the line, and consuming the people that were in them. The Targum of Palestine affirms that it \"destroyed some of the wicked in the outskirts of the house of Dan, with whom was a graven image;\" but this attempt to shift the responsibility, and to alter the character of the sin, is clearly worthless, and only suggested by occurrences wholly unconnected with the present (see Judges 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the people cried unto Moses. Fear brought them to their senses, and they knew that their only hope was in their mediator, who had already saved them by his intercession from a worse destruction (Exodus 32:30-34). The fire was quenched. Rather, \"went out.\" As its beginning was supernatural, or at least was so ordered as to appear so, its end also was due to the Divine intervention, not to human efforts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - and he called the name of the place Taberah. Or Taberah (תַּבְעֵרָה). This name does not occur in the list of stations in chapter 33, which mentions nothing between Sinai and Kibroth-Hattaavah. It would seem probable, however, that the conflagration occurred while Israel was encamped, or else there could hardly have been a burning \"in the end of the camp.\" We may therefore suppose either that Tabeerah was some spot in the immediate neighbourhood of Sinai whither the people gathered for their first long march; or that it was one of the halting-places on the \"three days' journey\" not mentioned in the list, because that journey was considered as all one; or that it was the same place afterwards called Kibroth-Hatta-avah. There is nothing in the narrative to decide a question which is in itself unimportant. It is necessary to remember that where the ancient and local names derived from marked natural features were not available, such names as Tabeerah given to the halting-places of so vast a host must have had a very loose significance.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 11:4-35 KIBROTH HATTAAVAH (verses 4-35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. The mixed multitude. Hebrew, ha-saphsuph, the gathered; the rift-raft, or rabble, which had followed the fortunes of Israel out of Egypt, where they had probably been strangers and slaves themselves. What the nature and the number and the fate of this rabble were is a matter of mere conjecture and of some perplexity. There does not seem any room for them in the regulations laid down for Israel, nor are they mentioned in any other place except at Exodus 12:38. In Leviticus 24:10 we read of the son of an Israelitish woman by an Egyptian father, and this might lead us to conjecture that a great part of the \"mixed multitude\" was the offspring of such left-handed alliances. These half-breeds, according to the general rule in such cases, would follow their mothers; they would be regarded with contempt by the Jews of pure blood, and would accompany the march as hangers-on of the various tribes with which they were connected. As to their fate, it may be probably concluded, from the reason of things and from the absence of any further notice of them, that they found their way back to the slavery and the indulgences of Egypt; they were bound by no such strong restraints and animated by no such national feelings as the true people of the Lord. And the children of Israel also wept again. This expression, again (Hebrew, שׁוּב, used adverbially), would seem to point to some former weeping, and this is generally found in the \"murmuring\" of which they had been guilty in the desert of Sin (Exodus 16:2, 3). This, however, is unsatisfactory for several reasons: first, because that occurrence was too remote, having been more than a year ago; second, because there is no mention of any \"weeping\" at that time; third, because the matter of complaint on the two occasions was really quite different: then they murmured faithlessly at the blank starvation which apparently stared them in the face; now they weep greedily at the absence of remembered luxuries. It is therefore much more likely that the expression has regard to the \"complaining\" which had just taken place at Tabeerah. It was indeed wonderful that the punishment then inflicted did not check the sin; wonderful that it burst out again in an aggravated form almost immediately. But such was the obstinacy of this people, that Divine vengeance, which only perhaps affected a few, and only lasted for a brief space, was not sufficient to silence their wicked clamour. Who shall give us flesh to eat? בָּשָׂר - Septuagint, κρέα - means flesh-meat generally. They had flocks and herds it is true, but they were no doubt carefully preserved, and the increase of them would little more than suffice for sacrifice; no one would dream of slaughtering them for ordinary eating.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely, i.e., gratis. No doubt this was an exaggeration on the part of the murmurers, but it is attested by classical writers that fish swarmed in the Nile waters, and cost next to nothing (Died. Sic., 1:36, 52; Herod., 2:93; Strabo, 17. page 829). Cucumbers. קִשֻׁאִים. Cucumbers of peculiar softness and flavour are spoken of by Egyptian travelers as fructus in Egypto omnium vulgatissimus. Melons. אַבַטִּחִים. Water-melons, still called battieh, grow in Egypt, as in all hot, moist lands, like weeds, and are as much the luxury of the poorest as of the richest. Leeks. חָצִיר. This word usually means grass (as in Psalm 104:14), and may do so hare, for the modern Egyptians eat a kind of field-clover freely. The Septuagint, however, translates it by τὰ πράσα, leeks or chives, which agrees better with the context. Pliny (Nat. Hist. 19:33) speaks of it as \"laudatissimus porrus in Egypto.\" Onions. בְּצָלִים. Garlic. שׁוּמְים. These are mentioned in the well-known passage of Herodotus (2:125) as forming the staple food of the workmen at the pyramids; these still form a large part of the diet of the labouring classes in Egypt, as in other Mediterranean countries. If we look at these different articles of food together, so naturally and inartificially mentioned in this verse, we find a strong argument for the genuineness of the narrative. They are exactly the luxuries which an Egyptian labourer of that day would have cried out for, if deprived of them; they are not the luxuries which a Jew of Palestine would covet, or would even think cf. The very words here used for the cucumber, the melon, and the garlic were probably Egyptian, for they may still be recognized in the common names of those vegetables in Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Our soul is dried away. This exaggerated statement expressed their craving for the juicy and savoury food of which they had been thinking, and which was obviously unattainable in the wilderness. There is a physical craving in man for variety of diet, and especially for such condiments and flavours as he has been used to all his life, which makes the lack of them a real hardship. It is not necessary to condemn the Israelites for feeling very keenly the loss of their accustomed food, which is notoriously the one thing which the poorest classes are least able to bear; it is only necessary to condemn them for making this one loss of more account than all their gain. There is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. Rather, \"we have nothing (אֵין כֹּל) except that our eye (falls) upon this manna.\" These graphic words speak of the longing looks which turned in every direction after the accustomed dainties, only to fall with disgust upon the inevitable manna. It was very ungrateful of them to speak disparagingly of the manna, which was good and wholesome food, and sufficient to keep them in health and strength; but it is useless to deny that manna only for people who had been accustomed to a rich and varied diet must have been exceedingly trying both to the palate and the stomach (cf. Numbers 21:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The manna was as coriander seed. On the name and the nature of the manna see Exodus 16:31. It is commonly supposed that the brief description here inserted was intended to show the unreasonableness of the popular complaints. There is no trace whatever of any such purpose. So far as the description conveys fresh information, it was simply suggested by the occurrence of the word \"manna,\" according to the artless style of the narrative. If any moral purpose must be assigned to this digression, it would rather be to suggest that the people had some real temptation to complain. It is often forgotten that, although the manna was supernatural, at least as to the amount and regularity of its supply, yet as an article of food it contained no supernatural elements. If we had to live upon nothing but cakes flavored with honey or with olive oil, it is certain that we should soon find them pall upon our appetite. To the eye of the Psalmist the manna appeared as angels' food (Psalm 78:25); but then the Psalmist had not lived on manna every day for a year. We have to remember, in this as in many other cases, that the Israelites would not be \"our ensamples\" (τύποι ἡμῶν, 1 Corinthians 10:6) if they had not succumbed to real temptations. As the colour of bdellium. See on Genesis 2:12. As no one knows anything at all about bdellium, this adds nothing to our knowledge of the manna. The Septuagint has here εῖδος κρυστάλλου, \"the appearance of ice,\" or perhaps \"of hoar-frost.\" As it translates bdellium in Genesis 2:12 by ἄνθραξ (carbuncle), it is probable that the comparison to ice here is due to some tradition about the manna. Taking this passage in connection with Exodus 16:31, we may reasonably conjecture that it was of an opalescent white, the same colour probably which is mentioned in connection with manna in Revelation 2:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the people... ground it in mills. This information as to the preparation of the manna is new. It may be supposed that at first the people ate it in its natural state, but that afterwards they found out how to prepare it in different ways for the sake of variety. Small handmills and mortars for the preparation of grain they would have brought with them from their Egyptian homes. As the taste of fresh oil. In Exodus 16:31 it is said to have tasted like wafers made with honey. Nothing is more impossible adequately to describe than a fresh taste. It is sufficient to note that the two things suggested by the taste of the manna, honey and oil, present the greatest possible contrast to the heavy or savoury food which they remembered in Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And when the dew fell,... the manna fell upon it. We know from Exodus 16:14 that when the dew evaporated in the morning it left a deposit of manna upon the ground; we learn here that the manna fell upon the dew during the night. Now the dew is deposited in the cool of the night beneath a clear sky, when radiation of heat goes on uninterruptedly from the earth's surface; it is clear, therefore, that the manna was let fall in some way beyond human experience from the upper air. What possible physical connection there could be between the dew and the manna we cannot tell. To the untaught mind, however, the dew seemed to come more directly than any other gift of nature from the clear sky which underlay the throne of God; and thus the Jew was led to look upon the manna too as coming to him day by day direct front the storehouse of heaven (cf. Psalm 78:23, 24; Psalm 105:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Throughout their families. Every family weeping by itself. Such was the contagion of evil, that every family was infected. Compare Zechariah 12:12 for a description of a weeping similar in character, although very different in its cause. Every man in the door of his tent. So that his wailing might be heard by all. So public and obtrusive a demonstration of grief must of course have been pre-arranged. They doubtless acted thus under the impression that if they made themselves sufficiently troublesome and disagreeable they would get all they wanted; in this, as in much else, they behaved exactly like ill-trained children. Moses also was displeased. The word \"also\" clearly compares and unites his displeasure with that of God. The murmuring indeed of the people was directed against God, and against Moses as his minister. The invisible King and his visible viceroy could not be separated in the regard of the people, and their concerted exhibition of misery was intended primarily for the eye of the latter. It was, therefore, no wonder that such conduct roused the wrath of Moses, who had no right to be angry, as well as the wrath of God, who had every right to be. angry. Moses sinned because he failed to restrain his temper within the exact limits of what befits the creature, and to distinguish carefully between a righteous indignation for Cod and an angry impatience with men. But he sinned under very sore provocation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? These passionate complaints were clearly wrong, because exaggerated. God had not thrown upon Moses the responsibility of getting the people safely into Canaan, or of providing flesh for them; and apart from these exaggerations, it was a selfish and cowardly thing thus to dwell upon his own grievance, and to leave out of sight the grave dishonour done to God, and the awful danger incurred by the people. It was the more blameworthy in Moses because upon a former occasion he had taken upon him, with almost perilous boldness, to remonstrate with God, and to protest against the vengeance he threatened to inflict (Exodus 32:11-13). In a word, Moses forgot himself and his duty as mediator, and in his indignation at the sin of the people committed the same sin himself. It is a strong note of genuineness that so grave (and yet so natural) a fault should be recorded with such obvious simplicity. Compare the cases of Elijah (1 Kings 19) and of Jonah (chapter 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father. Probably he meant to say that this was the part and the duty of God himself as the Creator and Father of Israel. Compare the reading, which is perhaps the correct one, in Acts 13:18: Τεσσαρακονταετῆ χρόνον ἐτροφοόρησεν αὐτοὺς ἑν τῇ ἐρήμῳ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - 1 am not able to bear all this people alone. This complaint, while reasonable in itself, shows how unreasonable the rest of his words were. However many he might have had to share his responsibilities, be could not have provided flesh for the people, nor enabled them to live one day in the wilderness; this had never been laid upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, or \"quite.\" Hebrew, תָרֹג, inf. abs. And let me not see my wretchedness. Let me not live to see the total failure of my hopes and efforts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And the Lord said unto Moses. The Divine dignity and goodness of this answer, if not an absolutely conclusive testimony, are at least a very strong one, to the genuineness of this record. Of what god, except the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was it ever witnessed, or could it have been ever imagined, that he should answer the passionate injustice of his servant with such forbearance and kindness? The one thing in Moses' prayer which was reasonable he allowed at once; the rest he passed over without answer or reproof, as though it had never been uttered. Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel. That the number seventy has a symbolic significance in Scripture will hardly be denied (cf. Exodus 1:5; Daniel 9:2, 24; Luke 10:1), although it is probably futile to affix any precise meaning to it. Perhaps the leading idea of seventy is fullness, as that of twelve is symmetry (see on Exodus 15:27). The later Jews believed that there were seventy nations in the world. There is no reason, except a reckless desire to confound the sacred narrative, to identify this appointment with that narrated in Exodus 18:21, sq. and Deuteronomy 1:9, sq. The circumstances and the purposes appear quite distinct: those were appointed to assist Moses in purely secular matters, to share his burden as a judge; these to assist him in religious matters, to support him as a mediator; those used the ordinary gifts of wisdom, discretion, and personal authority; these the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. It is more reasonable to suppose that these seventy were the same men that went up into Mount Sinai with Moses, and saw the God of Israel, and ate of the consecrated meal of the covenant, about a year before. Unless there was some decisive reason against it, an elder who had been chosen for that high religious privilege could hardly fail to be chosen on this occasion also; an interview with God himself, so mysteriously and awfully significant, must surely have left an ineffaceable stamp of sanctity on any soul at all worthy of it. It would be natural to suppose that while the present selection was made de novo, the individuals selected were personally the same. Compare note on chapter Numbers 1:5, and for \"the elders of Israel\" see on Exodus 3:16. Whom thou knowest to be elders of the people, and officers over them. On the officers (Hebrew, shoterim), an ancient order in the national organization of Israel, continued from the days of bondage, see Exodus 5:6. The Targ. Pal. paraphrases the word shoterim by \"who were set over them in Mizraim.\" The Septuagint has here πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ γρυμματεῖς αὐτῶν, words so familiar to the reader of the Greek Gospels. The later Jews traced back their Sanhedrim, or grand council of seventy, to this appointment, and found their eiders and scribes in this verse. There was, however, no further historical connection between the two bodies than this - that when the monarchy failed and prophecy died out, the ecclesiastical leaders of the Jews modeled their institutions upon, and adapted their titles to, this Divinely-ordered original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17 - I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them. The Holy Spirit is one and indivisible. But in the language of Scripture \"the Spirit\" often stands for the charismata, or gifts of the Spirit, and in this sense is freely spoken of as belonging to this or that man. So the \"spirit of Elijah\" (2 Kings 2:9, 15), which was transferred to Elisha, as it were, by bequest. It was not, therefore, the personal indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost in Moses which God caused him to share with the seventy elders, for that can in no ease be a matter of transfer or of arrangement, but simply those charismata or extraordinary gifts of the Spirit which Moses had hitherto enjoyed alone as the prophet of Israel. It is strange that in the face of the clear teaching of St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and in view of such cases as those of Saul (1 Samuel 10:10; 19:93) and David (1 Samuel 16:13), any difficulty should have been felt about this passage. They shall bear the burden of the people with thee. It does not appear how they were to do this, nor is there any record of their work. Their gifts, however, were spiritual, and we may probably assume that their usefulness lay in producing and maintaining a proper religious tone among the people. The real difficulty which stood in the way of Moses was not one of outward organization or of government, for that had been amply provided for; it lay in the bad tone which prevailed among the people, and threatened to destroy at any moment the very foundations of their national hope and safety. We may see in these seventy not indeed a Sanhedrim to exercise authority and discipline, but the first commencement of that prophetic order which afterwards played so large a part in the religious history of Israel and of the early Christian Church - an order designed kern the first to supplement by the freedom and originality of their ministry the more formal and unvarying offices of the priesthood. If this was the nature of their usefulness, it is not surprising that they are never mentioned again; and it is observable that a similar obscurity hangs over the activity of the prophets of the New Testament, who yet formed a most important part of the gospel regime (cf. 1 Corinthians 14:29-32; Ephesians 2:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow. By certain ablutions, and by avoidance of legal pollution (see Exodus 19:10, 14, 15). The people were to prepare themselves as for some revelation of God's holiness and majesty. In truth it was for a revelation of his wrath, and of the bitter consequences of sin. There is about the words, as interpreted by the result, a depth of very terrible meaning; it was as though a traitor, unknowing of his doom, were bidden to a grand ceremonial on the morrow, which ceremonial should be his own execution. For it was well with us in Egypt. These false and wicked words, in which the base ingratitude of the people reached its highest pitch, are repeated to them in the message of God with a quiet sternness which gave no sign to their callous ears of the wrath they had aroused.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But even a whole month. There is some little difficulty about these words, because the Israelites do not seem to have made a long stay at Kibroth-Hattaavah, and the miraculous supply does not seem to have followed them. The words are words of stern irony and displeasure, and need not be literally pressed: it was enough that animal food was given them in quantity sufficient to have gorged the whole nation for a month, if they had eared to go on eating it (see below on verse 33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And Moses said. Moses had not recovered from the impatient and despairing temper into which the ill-behaviour of the people had betrayed him. He could not really have doubted the Divine power to do this, after what he had seen in the desert of Sin (Exodus 16:13), but he spoke petulantly, and indeed insolently, out of the misery which was yet in his heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Shall the flocks and herds be slain? Which they had brought out of Egypt with them (see on Exodus 12:32), and which no doubt were carefully husbanded, partly in order to supply them with milk and other produce, partly in order to maintain the sacrifices of the law. All the fish of the sea. A wild expression from which nothing can be fairly argued as to the present position of the camp.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Is the Lord's hand waxed short? So that it cannot reach far enough to fulfill his purposes. This simple and expressive figure of speech is adopted by Isaiah (Isaiah 1:2; Isaiah 59:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Moses went out, i.e., out of the tabernacle. It is not stated that he went into the tabernacle to bring his complaint before the Lord, but the narrative obviously implies that he did (see on Numbers 7:89).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The Lord came down in a cloud, i.e., in the cloud which was the symbol of his perpetual presence with. them. At other times this cloud dwelt (שָׁכַן) above the tabernacle, soaring steadily above it in the clear air; but on certain occasions, for greater impressiveness, the cloud came down and filled the tabernacle, or at any rate the entrance of it, while Moses stood without (cf. Numbers 12:5 and Exodus 33:9; Exodus 40:35). Took of the spirit which was upon him. Not certainly in anger, or by way of diminishing the fullness of the spirit which was in Moses, but in order that the seventy might participate, and be known to participate, in a gift originally and specially given to Moses. The whole intention of the ceremonial was to declare in the most unmistakable way that the gifts of the seventy were to be exercised only in union with and in subordination to the mediator of Israel. The Targums are substantially correct in their paraphrase: \"The Lord made enlargement of the spirit that was upon him, and imparted to the seventy men, the eiders.\" Theodoret very happily observes on this passage, \"Just as a man who kindles a thousand flames from one does not lessen the first in communicating light to the others, so God did not diminish the grace imparted to Moses by the fact that he communicated of it to the seventy.\" They prophesied. The phenomenon here mentioned for the first time was no doubt an ecstatic utterance, not exactly beyond the control, but certainly beyond the origination, of those who prophesied. It must not be confounded with that state of calm, spiritual exaltation in which such men as Isaac and Jacob spake concerning things to come (Hebrews 11:20; cf. Genesis 27:29; Genesis 49:28). The Hebrew יִתְנַבְּאוּ means literally \"were caused to pour forth,\" and the fundamental idea is that those affected became for the time being vents for the audible utterance of thoughts and expressions which were not theirs, but the Holy Ghost's. Compare the thought in Job 32:18-20, and the case of Saul and his messengers, as above. As to the matter of these prophesyings, we may probably conclude that they were of the same nature as the ecstatic utterances of the tongues on the day of Pentecost and afterwards; not \"prophecy\" in the ordinary sense, but inspired glorification of God, and declaration of his wonderful works (Acts 2:4, 11). And did not cease. Rather, \"did not add,\" or \"repeat.\" וְלֹא יָסְפוּ. Septuagint, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι προσέθεντο. The ecstatic utterance did not continue or reappear. The New Testament history no doubt supplies us with the explanation of this. The supernatural sign thus accorded was of little use in itself, and was of much danger, because it attracted to its exhibition an attention which was rather due to more inward and spiritual things. As a sign it was sufficient that it should be once unmistakably manifested before all the people. (cf. 1 Corinthians 14:22; 1 Corinthians 13:8). The permanent charisma of the Holy Spirit which the seventy received and retained from this time forth was no doubt the ἀντιλήψις or κυβερνήσις of 1 Corinthians 12:28; the gift of \"help\" or \"governance,\" not in temporal matters, but in the religious education and direction of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - There remained two of the men in the camp. No reason is here given why they did not accompany the rest to the tabernacle; but as they did not thereby forfeit the gift designed for them, it is certain that some necessity or duty detained them. They were of them that were written. This incidental notice shows how usual the practice of writing was, at any rate with Moses, who was \"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\" (Acts 7:22). And they prophesied in the camp. As a sign that they too had received the charisma from the Lord. Seeing that it was the work of the Holy Spirit, there was of course nothing really more wonderful in their case than in the ease of the others, but no doubt it seemed so. That men in the camp, and away from the visible center and scene of Divine manifestations, should be accessible to the heavenly afflatus was a vast astonishment to an ignorant people. We may compare the surprise felt by the Jewish Christians when the sign of tongues was shown among the Gentiles (Acts 10:45, 46).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And there ran a young man. Literally, \"the young man,\" - הַנַּעַר; ὁ νεανἱσκος, Septuagint, - by which some understand the young men of the camp collectively, but this is doubtful in grammar and unsatisfactory in sense. If this book was compiled from previous records, of which there are many apparent traces, we may suppose that the name of this young man was there given, but here for some reason omitted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Joshua the son of Nun. See on Exodus 17:9. As before, he is called Joshua by anticipation. One of his young men. This implies that there were others who to some extent shared his duties towards Moses; but that Joshua stood in a peculiar relation to his master is evident from Exodus 24:13 and Exodus 32:17, as well as from this passage itself. My lord Moses, forbid them. Probably he did not know that they had been enrolled, and he was naturally jealous for the honour of Moses - a jealousy which was not at all unnecessary, as the events of the next chapter proved. The prophesying of Eldad and Medad in the camp might well seem like the setting up of an independent authority, not in harmony with that of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Enviest thou for my sake? In this answer speaks for once \"the meekest of men.\" It was his sad fate that his position as representative of God obliged him to see repressed with terrible visitations any rebellion against his sole and absolute authority. But he was devoid of personal ambition at all times, and at this time weary and disgusted with the responsibility of ruling such a people. How much more for the glory of God, and for his own peace, would it be if not only these, but all the people, shared the gifts of the Spirit! Mark 9:38, 39 presents a partial, but still a striking, parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Moses gat him into the camp. Although the tabernacle stood in the midst of the camp, yet it was practically separated from the tents of the other tribes by an open space and by the encampments of the Levites. There is, therefore, no ground for inferring from this and similar expressions that the record really belongs to a time when the tabernacle was pitched outside the camp.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - A wind from the Lord. A wind Divinely sent for this purpose. In Psalm 78:26 it is said to have been a wind from the east and south, i.e., a wind blowing up the Red Sea and across the Gulf of Akabah. And brought quails from the sea. On the \"quails\" (Hebrew, salvim - probably the common quail) see Exodus 16:13. The Septuagint has in both places ἡ ὀρτυγομήτρα, \"the quail-mother,\" the sense of which is uncertain. These birds, which migrate in spring in vast numbers, came from the sea, but it does not follow that the camp was near the sea. They may have been following up the Gulf of Akabah, and been swept far inland by the violence of the gale. Let them fall by the camp. Rather, \"threw them down on the camp.\" יִּטַשׁ עַל הַמַּחֲגֶה. Septuagint, ἐπέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὴν παρεμβολήν. Either the sudden cessation of the gale, or a violent eddying of the wind, threw the exhausted birds in myriads upon the camp (cf. Psalm 78:21, 28). Two cubits high upon the face of the earth. The word \"high\" is not in the original, but it probably gives the true meaning. The Septuagint, ὡσεὶ δίπηχυ ἀπο τῆς γῆς, is somewhat uncertain. The Targums assert that the quails \"flew upon the face of the ground, at a height of two cubits;\" and this is followed by the Vulgate (\"volabant in acre duobus cubitis altiludine super terram\") and by many commentators. This idea, however, although suggested by the actual habits of the bird, and adopted in order to avoid the obvious difficulty of the statement, is inconsistent with the expressions used here and in Psalm 78. If the birds were \"thrown\" upon the camp, or \"rained\" upon it like sand, they could not have been flying steadily forward a few feet above the ground. It is certainly impossible to take the statement literally, for such a mass of birds would have been perfectly unmanageable; but if we suppose that they were drifted by the wind into heaps, which in places reached the height of two cubits, that will satisfy the exigencies of the text: anything like a uniform depth would be the last thing to be expected under the circumstances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And the people stood up... next day. A statement which shows us how greedy the people were, and how inordinately eager to supply themselves with an abundance of animal food. They were so afraid of losing any of the birds that they stayed up all night in order to collect them; probably they only ceased gathering and began to cat when the available supply was spent. Ten homers. It is difficult to calculate the capacity of the homer, especially as it may have varied from age to age. If it contained ten ephahs, as seems to be implied in Ezekiel 45:11, and if the estimate of the Rabbinists (which is less than that of Josephus) be correct that the ephah held nearly four and a half gallons of liquid measure, then half a million of men must have collected more quails apiece than would have filled a 450 gallon tub. No doubt the total number was something enormous, and far above anything that could have been supplied by natural agencies. The gift of quails, like that of manna, was one of the gifts of nature proper to that region Divinely multiplied and extended, so as to show forth in the most striking way the boundless power and beneficence of God. They spread them all abroad. In order to dry them in the sun, as the Egyptians used to do with fish (Herod., 2:77), and as the South Americans do with beef. Flesh thus cured does not need salt, which the Israelites would not have in sufficient quantities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed. If this were taken in the most literal sense, it would mean that no one of the people had time to swallow a single morsel of the coveted food ere he was stricken down by the Divine visitation. We can scarcely imagine, however, that such was the case in every single instance. It would indeed appear as if they had with one consent postponed the enjoyment of eating the quails until they had gathered as huge a quantity for future use as possible; as if in defiance and contempt of the Divine warning that their greed would turn to satiety and loathing (see verses 19 and 32). If this were so, then the feast to which they so eagerly looked forward would begin throughout the camps on the second night, and the visitation of God might well have had the sudden and simultaneous character attributed to it here and in Psalm 78:30, 31. At any rate the statement of the text positively excludes the idea that they went on eating quails for a whole month, according to the promise (or threat) of verse 20. There was flesh enough to have secured the literal fulfillment of that promise by gorging them for a whole month; but it is evident that the Divine wrath anticipated any such tardy revenges, and smote its victims in the very moment of their keenest gratification. The Lord smote the people with a very great plague. Both ancients and moderns state that the flesh of quails is unwholesome (cf. Pliny, 10:23), but this appears to have no very valid foundation. Unquestionably quails eaten for a month by people unused to a flesh diet would produce many and fatal sicknesses; but there is no room for any such natural results here. Whatever form the plague may have taken, it was as clearly supernatural in its suddenness and intensity as the supply of quails itself. We do not know anything as to who were smitten, or how many; the Psalmist tells us that they were \"the fattest\" and \"the chosen in Israel, and we may naturally suppose that those who had been foremost in the lusting and the murmuring were foremost in the ruin which followed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Kibroth-Hattaavah. The graves of greediness. Septuagint, Μνήματα τῆς ἐπιθυμίας. This name, like Tabeerah, was given to the place by the Israelites themselves in connection with their own history; the name, therefore, like the sad memory it enshrined, lived only in the sacred record. It is utterly uncertain where it lay, except that it was apparently the terminus of a three days' journey from Sinai, and in the desert of Paran. How long they stayed at Kibroth-Hattaavah is also quite uncertain. If the plague followed hard upon the coming of the quails, a few days would suffice for all the events recorded in this chapter, and we may well believe that the people would be only too glad to receive the signal of departure as soon as they had buried their unhappy brethren.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers11:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And abode at Hazeroth. Or, \"were in Hazeroth.\" Septuagint, ἐγένετο ὁ λαὸς Ἀσηρώθ. Hazeroth, from חָצַר, to shut in, means \"enclosures;\" so named perhaps from some ancient stone enclosures erected by wandering tribes for their herds and flocks. It has been identified with Ain el Hadhera, a fountain eighteen hours northeast of Sinai, but on no satisfactory grounds beyond a partial resemblance of name. Assuming that the march lay in a northerly direction through the desert of Paran, the Israelites would naturally follow the road which leads across the southern mountain barrier of et-Tih, and on by the Wady es-Zulakeh into the desert plateau. On this road there is a large fountain, with pasturage, at a place called el Ain, and another somewhat further at Bit ed-Themmed. One or other of these was probably the site of Hazeroth (cf. Stanley, 'Sinai,' page 84). It is, however, entirely a matter of conjecture, and of little real interest. The progress of Israel which is of unfading importance to us is a moral and religious, and not a geographical, progress.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses. While the people were encamped at Hazeroth (see verse 16), and therefore probably very soon after the events of the last chapter. That Miriam's was the moving spirit in the matter is sufficiently evident,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because her name stands first;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) because the verb \"spake\" is in the feminine (יַתְּדַבֵּר, \"and she said\");NEWLINENEWLINE(3) because the ground of annoyance was a peculiarly feminine one, a mesalliance;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) because Miriam alone was punished;NEWLINENEWLINE(5) because Aaron never seems to have taken the lead in anything.NEWLINENEWLINEHe appears uniformly as a man of weak and pliable character, who was singularly open to influence from others, for good or for evil. Superior to his brother in certain gifts, he was as inferior to him in force of character as could well be. On the present occasion there can be little question that Aaron simply allowed himself to be drawn by his sister into an opposition with which he had little personal sympathy; a general discontent at the manifest inferiority of his position inclined him to take up her quarrel, and to echo her complaints. Because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. Hebrew, a Cushite woman. The descendants of Cush were distributed both in Africa (the Ethiopians proper) and in Asia (the southern Arabians, Babylonians, Ninevites, &c.). See Genesis 10. Some have thought that this Ethiopian woman was none other than the Midianite Zipporah, who might have been called a Cushite in some loose sense by Miriam. The historian, however, would not have repeated in his own name a statement so inaccurate; nor is it at all likely that that marriage would have become a matter of contention after so many years. The natural supposition undoubtedly is that Moses (whether after the death of Zipporah, or during her lifetime, we cannot tell) had taken to himself a second wife of Hamite origin. Where he found her it is useless to conjecture; she may possibly have been one of the \"mixed multitude\" that went up out of Egypt. It is equally useless to attribute any moral or religious character to this marriage, of which Holy Scripture takes no direct notice, and which was evidently regarded by Moses as a matter of purely private concern to himself. In general we may say that the rulers of Israel attached neither political, social, nor religious significance to their marriages; and that neither law nor custom imposed any restraint upon their choice, so long as they did not ally themselves with the daughters of Canaan (see Exodus 34:16). It would be altogether beside the mark to suppose that Moses deliberately married a Cushite woman in order to set forth the essential fellowship between Jew and Gentile. It is true that such marriages as those of Joseph, of Salmon, of Solomon, and others undeniably became invested with spiritual importance and evangelical significance, in view of the growing narrowness of Jewish feeling, and of the coming in of a wider dispensation; but such significance was wholly latent at the time. If, however, the choice of Moses is inexplicable, the opposition of Miriam is intelligible enough. She was a prophetess (Exodus 15:20), and strongly imbued with those national and patriotic feelings which are never far removed from exclusiveness and pride of race. She had - to use modern words - led the Te Deum of the nation after the stupendous overthrow of the Egyptians. And now her brother, who stood at the head of the nation, had brought into his tent a Cushite woman, one of the dark-skinned race which seemed oven lower in the religious scale than the Egyptians themselves. Such an alliance might easily seem to Miriam nothing better than an act of apostasy which would justify any possible opposition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? This is evidently not the \"speaking against Moses\" mentioned in the previous verse, for that is distinctly said to have been on the score of Moses' marriage. This is their justification of themselves for daring to dispute his judgment and arraign his proceedings; a thing which clearly required justification. Moses himself, or more likely others for him, had remonstrated with them on the language they were using. They retorted that Moses had no monopoly of Divine communications; Aaron also received the revelation of God by Urim and Thummim, and Miriam was a prophetess. They were acknowledged in a general sense as sharing with him the leadership of Israel (see Micah 6:4); upon this they meant to found a claim to coordinate authority. They would have had perhaps all matters settled in a family council in which they should have had an equal voice. It was hard for them both to forget that Moses was only their younger brother: for Miriam that she had saved his life as an infant; for Aaron that he had been as prominent as Moses in the original commission from God to the people. And the Lord heard it. In one sense he hears everything; in another sense there are many things which he does not choose to hear, because he does not wish to take judicial notice of them. Thus he had not \"heard\" the passionate complaints of Moses himself a short time before, because his will was then to pardon, not to punish (cf. Isaiah 42:19; Malachi 3:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth. For the Hebrew עָנָו the Septuagint has πραὺς here; the Vulgate, mitis. The Targum Palestine has \"bowed down in his mind,\" i.e., overwhelmed (\"plagued,\" Luther). The ordinary version is undoubtedly' right; the object of the parenthesis was either to explain that there was no real ground for the hostility of Miriam and Aaron, or to show that the direct interference of the Lord himself was necessary for the protection of his servant. The verse bears a difficulty on its very face, because it speaks of Moses in terms which could hardly have been used by Moses of himself. Nor is this difficulty in the least degree diminished by the explanations which are offered by those who are determined to maintain at any cost the Mosaic authorship of every word in the Pentateuch. It is no doubt true to some extent that when a great and good man is writing of himself (and especially when he writes under the influence of the Holy Spirit), he can speak of himself with the same calm and simple truthfulness with which he would speak of any other. It is sufficient, however, to refer to the example of St. Paul to show that neither any height of spiritual privilege and authority, nor any intensity of Divine inspiration, obliterates the natural virtue of modesty, or allows a really humble man to praise himself without pain and shrinking. It is also to be observed that while St. Paul forces himself to speak of his privileges, distinctions, and sufferings, all of which were outward to himself, Moses would here be claiming for himself the possession of an inward virtue in greater measure than any other living soul. Surely it is not too much to say that if he did possess it in such measure, he could not possibly have been conscious that he did; only One was thus conscious of his own ineffable superiority, and this very consciousness is one of the strongest arguments for believing that he was infinitely more than a mere man, howsoever good and exalted. There is but one theory that will make it morally possible for Moses to have written this verse, viz., that in writing he was a mere instrument, and not morally responsible for what he did write. Such a theory will find few upholders. But, further, it is necessary to prove not only that Moses might have made this statement, but also that he might have made it in this form. Granted that it was necessary to the narrative to point out that he was very meek; it was not necessary to assert that he was absolutely the meekest man living. And if it was unnecessary, it was also unnatural. No good man would go out of his way to compare himself to his own advantage with all men upon the face of the earth. The whole form of the sentence, indeed, as well as its position, proclaim it so clearly to be an addition by some later hand, that the question may be left to the common sense and knowledge of human nature of every reader; for the broad outlines of human character, morality, and virtue are the same in every age, and are not displaced by any accident of position, or even of inspiration. A slight examination of passages from other sacred writers, which are sometimes adduced as analogous, will serve to show how profound is the difference between what holy men could say of themselves and what they could not (cf. Daniel 1:19, 20; Daniel 5:11, 12; Daniel 9:23; Daniel 10:11). On the question of the inspiration of this verse, supposing it to be an interpolation, and as to the probable author of it, see the Preface. As to the fact of Moses' meekness, we have no reason to doubt it, but we may legitimately look upon the form in which it is stated as one of those conventional hyperboles which are not uncommon even in the sacred writings (cf. Genesis 7:19; John 21:25). And we cannot avoid perceiving that Moses' meekness was far from being perfect, and was marred by sinful impatience and passion on more than one recorded occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord spake suddenly. How he spoke we cannot tell, but the word \"suddenly\" (Septuagint, παραχρῆμα) points to something unexpected and unusual. The voice seems to have come to the three in their tents before there was any thought in their minds of such an intervention. Come out ye three, i.e., out of the camp - probably the camp of Moses and Aaron, on the east of the tabernacle court (see Numbers 3:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud. The cloud which had been soaring above the tabernacle descended upon it (see Numbers 11:25 and Numbers 12:10). And stood in the door of the tabernacle. It would seem most natural to understand by these words the entrance to the holy place itself, and this would manifestly accord best with the movements of the cloud, as here described; for the cloud seems to have sunk down upon the sacred tent in token that the Lord was in some special sense present within it. On the other hand, the phrase must certainly be understood to mean the entrance of the court, or sacred enclosure, in Leviticus 8:3, 31, 33, and probably in other places. As it is hardly possible that the phrase can have had both meanings, the latter must be preferred. And they both came forth. Not out of the sanctuary, into which Miriam could not have entered, but out of the enclosure. The wrath which lay upon them both, and the punishment which was about to be inflicted upon one, were sufficient reasons for calling them out of the holy ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - If there boa prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known. More probably \"the Lord\" belongs to the first clause: \"If there be to you a prophet of the Lord, I will make myself known.\" So the Septuagint, ἐὰν γένηται προφήτης ὑμῶν Κυρίῳ... . γνωσθήσομαι. In a vision. Ἐν ὀράματι. An internal vision, in which the eyes (even if open) saw nothing, but the effects of vision' were produced upon the sensorium by other and supernatural means (see, e.g., Amos 7:7, 8; Acts 10:11). Speak unto him in a dream. Rather, speak \"in him\" - בּו. The voice that spake to the prophet was an internal voice, causing no vibration of the outer air, but affecting only the inner and hidden seat of consciousness. It is not necessary to restrict the prophetic dream to the time of sleep; a waking state, resembling what we call day-dream, in which the external senses arc quiescent, and the imagination is freed from its usual restraints, was perhaps the more usual mental condition at the time. Indeed the Divine communications made to Joseph (Matthew 1:20; Matthew 2:13) and to the Magi (ibid. Numbers 2:12) are almost the only ones we read of as made during actual sleep, unless we include the case of Pilate's wife (ibid. Numbers 27:19); and none of these were prophets in the ordinary sense. Compare, however, Acts 2:17 b.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - My servant Moses is not so. No words could more clearly and sharply draw the distinction between Moses and the whole laudabilis numerus of the prophets. It is strange that, in the face of a statement so general and so emphatic, it should have been doubted whether it applied to such prophets as Isaiah or Daniel. It was exactly in \"visions\" and in \"dreams,\" i.e., under the peculiar psychological conditions so-called, that these greatest of prophets received their revelations from heaven. The exceeding richness and wonder of some of these revelations did not alter the mode in which they were received, nor raise them out of the ordinary conditions of the gradus propheticus. As prophets of future things they were much greater than Moses, and their writings may be to us far more precious; but that does not concern the present question, which turns exclusively upon the relation between the Divine Giver and the human receiver of the revelation. If words mean anything, the assertion here is that Moses stood on an altogether different footing from the \"prophet of the Lord\" in respect of the communications which he received from the Lord. It is this essential superiority of position on the part of Moses which alone gives force and meaning to the important declarations of Deuteronomy 18:15; John 1:21 b.; John 6:14; 7:40, &c. Moses had no successor in his relations with God until that Son of man came, who was \"in heaven\" all the time he walked and spake on earth. Who is faithful in all mine house, נֶאֶמָן with בּ means to be proved, or attested, and so established (cf. 1 Samuel 3:20; 1 Samuel 22:14). The Septuagint gives the true sense, ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ μου πιστός, and so it is quoted in the Epistle to the Hebrews (chapter 3:2). The \"house\" of God, as the adjective \"whole\" shows, is not the tabernacle, but the house of Israel; the' word \"house\" standing for household, family, nation, as so often in the sacred writings (see Genesis 46:27; Leviticus 10:6; Hebrews 3:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Mouth to mouth. Equivalent to face to face in Exodus 33:11. What the exact facts of the case were it is not possible to know, scarcely to imagine; but the words seem to imply a familiar speaking with an audible voice on the part of God, as distinguished from the internal voice, inaudible to the ear, with which he spake \"in\" the prophets. To assert that the revelations accorded to Moses were only subjective modifications of his own consciousness is to evacuate these strong words of any meaning whatever. Apparently. מַרְאֶה (Septuagint ἐν εἴδει) is an accusative in apposition to what goes before by way (apparently) of further definition. It is the same word translated \"vision\" in verse 6; but its meaning here must be determined by the expression \"in riddles,\" which stands in antithesis to it. It was confessed]y the case with most prophetic utterances that the language in which they were couched was quite as much intended to conceal as to express their full meaning; but to Moses God spake without any such concealments. The similitude of the Lord shall he behold. מַרְאֶה. Not the essential nature of God, which no man can see, but a form (wholly unknown and unimaginable to us) in which it pleased him to veil his glory. The Septuagint has τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου εῖδε, referring, apparently, to the vision promised in Exodus 33:22; and the Targum Palestine speaks here of the vision of the burning bush. The motive for this alteration is no doubt to be sought in a profound jealousy for the great truth declared in such texts as Deuteronomy 4:15; Isaiah 40:18, and afterwards in John 1:18; 1 Timothy 6:16. But the statement in the text is a general one, and can only mean that Moses habitually in his intercourse with God had before his eyes some visible manifestation of the invisible God, which helped to make that intercourse at once more awfully real and more intensely blessed. Such manifestation to the sense of sight must be distinguished both from the visionary (or subjective) sight of God in human figure accorded to Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:26), to Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), to St. John (Revelation 4:2, 8), and perhaps to others, and also from such theophanies in angel guise as are recorded in Genesis 32:30; Judges 13:9, 2, and elsewhere. On the other hand, the seventy elders seem to have seen the \"Temunah\" of the Lord upon that one occasion when they were called up into Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:10, 11). Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses! No doubt it was the double fact of their relationship to Moses after the flesh, and of their sharing with him in certain spiritual gifts and prerogatives, which made them oblivious of the great distinction which lifted him above their rivalry, and should have lifted him above their contradiction. That contradiction, however, served to bring out in the clearest way the singular and unapproached position of the mediator of Israel; and it serves still to enable us to estimate aright the peculiar dignity of his legislation and his writings. The substance of prophetic teaching may be of deeper interest and of wider import titan \"the law,\" but this latter will still rank higher in the scale of inspiration, as having been more directly communicated front on high. Thus \"the law\" (as the Jews rightly taught) remained the body of Divine revelation until \"that Prophet\" came who was \"like unto\" Moses in the fact that he enjoyed constant, open, and direct communication with the Godhead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he departed. As a judge departs from his judgment-seat after trying and convicting evil-doers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The cloud departed from off the tabernacle. During this awful interview the cloud of the Presence had rested on the tabernacle, as if it were the Divine chariot waiting for the King of Israel while he tarried within (cf. Psalm 104:3; Isaiah 19:1; Revelation 11:12). Now that his work is done he ascends his chariot again, and soars aloft above the host. Miriam became leprous. The Hebrews had become familiar with this terrible disease in Egypt. The Levitical legislation had made it more terrible by affixing to it the penalty of religious and social excommunication, and the stigma, as it were, of the Divine displeasure. Before this legislation Moses himself had been made partially and temporarily leprous, and that solely for a sign, and without any sense of punishment (Exodus 4:6). In Miriam's ease, however, as in all subsequent cases, the plague of leprosy was endued with moral as well as physical horror (cf. 2 Kings 5:27). As snow. This expression points to the perfect development of the disease, as contrasted with its earlier and less conspicuous stages. Aaron looked upon Miriam. If we ask why Aaron himself was not punished, the answer appears to be the same here as in the case of the golden calf.NEWLINENEWLINE1. He was not the leader in mischief, but only led into it through weakness.NEWLINENEWLINE2. He was, like many weak men, of an affectionate disposition (cf. Leviticus 10:19), and suffered his own punishment in witnessing that of others.NEWLINENEWLINE3. He was God's high priest, and the office would have shared in the disgrace of the man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee. Septuagint, δέομαι Κύριε. In thus addressing his brother Aaron acknowledged his superior position, and tacitly abandoned all pretension to equality. Lay not the sin upon us. Aaron speaks to Moses almost as if he were praying to God, so completely does. he recognize in his brother the representative of God (in a far higher sense than himself), who had power to bind and loose in the name and power of God. What Aaron really prays for is that the sin, which he frankly confesses, may not be imputed to them. The Levitical law had taught them to look upon sin as a burden, which in the nature of things the sinner must carry, but which by the goodness of God might be got rid of, or transferred to some one else (cf. Leviticus 4:4; Leviticus 16:21; John 1:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - As one dead. Rather, \"as the dead thing,\" i.e. the still-born child, in which death and decay have anticipated life. Such was the frightful effect of leprosy in its last stages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Moses cried unto the Lord. A much harder and prouder man than Moses was must needs have been melted into pity at the sight of his sister, and the terrible suggestion of Aaron. Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee. The \"now\" has no place here, unless it be merely to add force to the exclamation. Moses, although directly appealed to himself, can only appeal to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Lord said unto Moses. Presumably in the tabernacle, whither Moses would have returned to supplicate God. If her father had but spit in her face. The \"but\" is superfluous, and obscures the sense; the act mentioned is referred to not as something trifling, but as something in its way very serious. The Septuagint renders it correctly εἰ ὁ πατὴρ... πτύων ἐνέπτυσεν. The Targums have, \"if her father had corrected her.\" Probably they used this euphemism from a sense of a certain want of dignity and propriety in the original expression, considered as coming from the mouth of God. The act in question was, however, not uncommon in itself, and in significance clearly marked (see Deuteronomy 25:9). It was the distinctive note of public disgrace inflicted by one who had a right to inflict it. In the case of a father, it meant that he was thoroughly ashamed of his child, and judged it best (which would be only in extreme cases) to put his child to shame before all the world. So public a disgrace would certainly be felt in patriarchal times as a most severe calamity, and entailed by ordinary custom (as we learn here) retirement and mourning for seven days at least. How much more, when her heavenly Father had been driven to inflict a public disgrace upon her for perverse behavior, should the shame and the sorrow not be lightly put away,, but patiently endured for a decent period! (cf. Hebrews 12:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days. It does not say that Miriam was healed forthwith of her leprosy, but the presumption is to that effect. Not the punishment itself, but the shame of it, was to last according to the answer of God. Her ease, therefore, would not fall under the law of Numbers 5:2, or of Leviticus 13:46, but would be analogous to that treated of in Leviticus 14. No doubt size had to submit to all the rites there prescribed, humiliating as they must have been to the prophetess and the sister of the law-giver; and these rites involved exclusion from her tent for a period of seven days (Leviticus 14:8). By God's command exclusion from her tent was made exclusion from the camp.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - In the wilderness of Paran. It is somewhat strange that this note of place should be used a second time without explanation (see chapter Numbers 10:12, 33). Probably it is intended to mark the fact that they were still within the limits of Paran, although on the very verge of their promised laud. In the list of stations given in chapter Numbers 33, it is said (verse 18), \"They departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.\" This is with some probability identified with the Wady Redemat, which opens front the mountain mass of the Azazimat into the singular plain of Kudes, or Kadesh, the scene of the decisive events which followed.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINETHE REBELLION AT KADESH (chapters 13, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Send thou men, that they may search the land. If this account of the mission of the spies be compared with that given in Deuteronomy 1:20-25, it may be seen in a striking instance how entirely different a colour may be put upon the same circumstances by two inspired narratives. No one indeed will affirm that the two records are contradictory, or even inconsistent, and yet they leave an entirely different impression upon the mind; and no doubt were intended to. It is important to note that the Divine inspiration did not in the least prevent two sacred authors (cf. 2 Samuel 24:1 with 1 Chronicles 21:1), or even the same author at different times, from placing on record very distinct and even strongly contrasted aspects of the same facts, according to the point of view from which he was led to regard them. In Deuteronomy 1, Moses reminds the people that on their arrival at Kadesh he had bidden them go up and take possession; that they had then proposed to send men before them to examine the land; that the proposal had pleased him so well that he had adopted it and acted upon it. It is unquestionably strange that facts so material should have been omitted in the historical Book of Numbers. It is, however, to be considered -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That there is no contradiction between the two accounts. We may be certain from many a recorded example that Moses would not have acted on the popular suggestion without referring the matter to the Lord, and that it would be the Divine command (when given) which would really weigh with him.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the recital in Deuteronomy is distinctly ad populum, and that therefore their part in the whole transaction is as strongly emphasized as is consistent with the truth of the facts.NEWLINENEWLINE3. That the narrative of Numbers is fragmentary, and does not profess to give a full account of matters, especially in such particulars as do not directly concern the Divine government and guidance of Israel. It is not, therefore, a serious difficulty that the record only begins here at the point when God adopted as his own what had been the demand of the people. If we ask why he so adopted it, the probable answer is that he knew what secret disaffection prompted it, and to what open rebellion it would lead. It was better that such disaffection should be allowed to ripen into rebellion before they entered their promised land. Miserable as the desert wandering might be, it was yet a discipline which prepared the nation for better things; whereas the invasion of Canaan without strong faith, courage, and self-restraint (such as they showed under Joshua) could but have ended in national disaster and destruction. Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man. This was not part of the original proposition (Deuteronomy 1:22), but was agreeable to the general practice in matters of national concern, and was no doubt commanded in order that the whole people might share in the interest and responsibility of this survey. Every one a ruler among them. This does not mean that they were to be the tribe princes (as the names show), for they would not be suitable in respect of age, nor could they be spared for this service. They were \"heads of the children of Israel\" (verse 3), i.e., men of position and repute, but also no doubt comparatively young and active, as befitted a toilsome and hazardous excursion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - These were their names. None of these names occur elsewhere, except those of Caleb and Joshua. The order of the tribes is the same as in ch. 1, except that Zebulun is separated from the other sons of Leah, and placed after Benjamin, while the two sons of Joseph are separated from one another. In verse 11 \"the tribe of Joseph\" is explained to be \"the tribe of Manasseh;\" elsewhere it is either common to both, or confined to Ephraim (see Revelation 7:8, and cf. Ezekiel 37:16). No spy was sent for the tribe of Levi, because it was now understood to have no territorial claims upon the land of promise, and to stand altogether by itself in relation to the national hopes and duties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Caleb the son of Jephunneh. In Numbers 32:12 he is called \"the Kenezite\" (הַקְּנִזּי), which appears in Genesis 15:19 as the name of one of the ancient races inhabiting the promised land. It is possible that Jephunneh may have been connected by descent or otherwise with this race; it is more likely that the similarity of name was accidental. The younger son of Jephunneh, the father of Othniel, was a Kenaz (קְנַז), and so was Caleb's grandson (see on Joshua 15:17; 1 Chronicles 4:13, 15).

And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. The change was from הושֵׁעַ (Hoshea, help or salvation) to יְהושֻׁעַ (Jehoshua - the same name with the first syllable of the sacred name prefixed, and one of the vowel points modified). It was afterwards contracted into יֵשׁוּעַ (Jeshua; cf. Nehemiah 8:17), and has come to us in its current form through the Vulgate. The Septuagint has here ἐπωνόμασε τὸν Αὐσὴ Ιησοῦν, and so the name appears in the New Testament. It is an obvious difficulty that Joshua has already been called by his new name at Exodus 17:9, and in every other place where he has been mentioned. In fact he is only once elsewhere called Hoshea, and that in a place (Deuteronomy 32:44) where we should certainly not have expected it. There are two ways of explaining the difficulty, such as it is. We may suppose that the change of name was really made at this time, as the narrative seems (on the face of it) to assert; and then the previous mentions of Joshua by his subsequent and more familiar name will be cases of that anticipation which is so common in Scripture (cf., e.g., Matthew 9:9 with Mark 2:14). Or we may suppose, what is perhaps more in harmony with the course of Joshua's life, that the change bad been already made at the time of the victory over Amalek. In that case the Vav consec. in וַיִּקִרָא (and... called) must be referred to the order of thought, not of time, and a sufficient reason must be shown for the interpolation of the statement in this particular place. Such a reason may fairly be found in the probable fact that the names of the spies were copied out of the tribal registers, and that Joshua still appeared under his original name in those registers. As to the significance of the change, it is not easy to estimate it aright. On the one hand, the sacred syllable entered into so many of the Jewish names that it could not have seemed a very marked change; on the other hand, the fact that our Saviour received the same name because he was our Saviour throws a halo of glory about it which we cannot ignore. In the Divine providence Hoshea became Joshua because he was destined to be the temporal saviour of his people, and to lead them into their promised rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Get you up this way southward. Rather, \"get you up there (זֶה) in the Negeb.\" The Negeb, meaning literally \"the dryness,\" was the south-western district of Canaan, which bordered upon the desert, and partook more or less of its character. Except where springs existed, and irrigation could be carried out, it was unfit for settled habitation. See Joshua 15:19; Judges 1:15, where the same word is used. Go up into the mountain. From the Negeb they were to make their way into the mountain or hill country which formed the back-bone of Southern Palestine, from the Wady Murreh on the south to the plain of Esdraelon on the north. In after ages it formed the permanent center of the Jewish race and Jewish power. Cf. Judges 1:9 where the three natural divisions of Southern Palestine are mentioned together: חָהָר (ἡ ὀρεινή), the mountain; הַגֶּגֶב (ὁ Νότος), the steppe; הַשְּׁפֵלָה (ἡ πεδινή), the maritime plain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Whether they be strong or weak, few or many. It would appear that Moses was guilty of some indiscretion at least in giving these directions. Whether the people were strong or weak, many or few, should have been nothing to the Israelites. It was God that gave them the land; they had only to take possession boldly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not.

It is impossible to suppose that Moses needed himself to be informed on such particulars as are here mentioned. The intercourse between Egypt and Palestine was comparatively easy and frequent (see on Genesis 1:7), and no educated Hebrew could have failed to make himself acquainted with the main features of his fathers' home. We may see in these instructions a confirmation of the statement in Deuteronomy 1, that it was at the desire of the people, and for their satisfaction, that the spies were sent. The time of the first-ripe grapes.

There seems to be but one marked natural feature which could have been chosen for that purpose - the broad sandy depression called the Wady Murreh, which divides the mountain mass of the Azazimeh from the Rakhmah plateau, the southern extremity of the highlands of Judah. The plain of Kudes communicates with it at its upper or western end, and maybe counted a part of it. Unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. Septuagint, ἕως Ροὸβ εἰσπορευομένων Αἰμάθ. Hamath, now Hamah, was in Greek times Epiphaneia, on the Orontes, outside the limits of Jewish rule. The southern entrance to it lay between the ranges of Libanus and Anti-libanus (see note on Numbers 34:8). The Rehob here mentioned is not likely to have been either of the Rehobs in the territory of Asher (Joshua 19:28-30), but the Beth-rehob further to the east, and near to where Dan-Laish was afterwards built (Judges 18:28). It lies on the route to Hamath, and was at one time a place of some importance in the possession of the Syrians (2 Samuel 10:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And came unto Hebron. This and the following details of their journey are appended to the general statement of verse 21 in that inartificial style of narrative still common in the East. On the name Hebron, and the perplexities which it causes, see on Genesis 13:18; 23:2. Where Amman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. יְלִידֵי הָעֲנָק \"Anak's progeny.\" Septuagint, γενεαὶ Ἐνάχ (as in verse 28 and Joshua 15:14 b.), means simply \"descendants of Anak.\" The Beni-Anak (Beni-Anakim in Deuteronomy 1:28; Anakim in Deuteronomy 2:10, &c.) were a tribe whose remote and perhaps legendary ancestor was Anak son of Arba (see on Joshua 14:15). These three chiefs of the Beni-Anak are said to have been expelled from Hebron fifty years later by Caleb (Joshua 15:14; Judges 1:20). The gigantic size which the Anakim shared with the Emim and Rephaim, other remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants, may have been accompanied by remarkable longevity; or they may have been quite young at the time of this visit; or, finally, they may not have been individuals at all, but families or clans. Now Hebron was built seven years before Zean in Egypt. Hebron was in existence at the time of Abraham. Zoan was Tanis, near the mouth of the eastern branch of the Nile (see on Psalm 78:12, 43). If it be true that the Pharaoh of the exodus had his royal residence at Zoan, Moses may have had access to the archives of the city, or he may have learnt the date of its foundation from the priests who gave him his Egyptian education. That there was any real connection between the two places is extremely problematical, nor is it possible to give any reason for the abrupt insertion here of a fragment of history so minute and in itself so unimportant. There is, however, no one but Moses to whom the statement can with any sort of likelihood be traced; a later writer could have had no authority for making the statement, and no possible reason for inventing it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The brook of Eshcol. Rather, \"the valley of Eshcol,\" for it is not a land of brooks. Probably between Hebron and Jerusalem, where the grapes are still exceptionally fine, and the dusters of great size. They bare it between two on a staff, not on account of its weight, but simply in order not to spoil it. Common sense dictates the like precaution still in like cases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster. It is very probable that it was already known as the valley of Eshcol, from the friend of Abraham, who bore that name and lived in that neighbourhood (Genesis 14:13, 24). If so it is an admirable instance of the loose way in which etymologies are treated in the Old Testament: what the place really received was not a new name, but a new signification to the old name; but this appeared all one in the eyes of the sacred writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they returned from searching of the land after forty days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They returned... after forty days. This is a period of time which constantly recurs in the sacred books (see on Exodus 24:18). It points to the fact that their work was completely done, and the land thoroughly explored.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - To Kadesh (see note at the end of chapter 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - It floweth with milk and honey. According to the promise of God in his first message of deliverance to the people (see on Exodus 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Nevertheless. אֶפֶס כִּי. \"Only that.\" Septuagint, ἀλλ η} ὅτι. The people be strong. Moses himself had directed their attention to this point, and now they dwell on it to the exclusion of everything else.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The Amalekites. These descendants of Esau (see on Genesis 36:12) formed wild roving bands, which (like the Bedouins of the present day) infested rather than inhabited the whole country between Judaea and Egypt, including the Negeb. They are not numbered among the inhabitants of Canaan proper. The Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. It is not easy to say in what sense the word \"Canaanites\" is used here. At one time it is the name of one tribe amongst many, all descended from Canaan, the son of Ham, which dwelt in the land of promise; at another time it is apparently synonymous with \"Amorites,\" or rather includes both them and the allied tribes (cf. e.g., Judges 1:9). It is possible, though far from certain, that \"Canaanites\" in this place may mean \"Phoenicians,\" since Sidon was the first-born of Canaan (Genesis 10:15), and the northern portion of the maritime plain was certainly in their possession, and probably the upper part of the Ghor, or coast of Jordan. It would appear that the Philistines had not at this time made themselves masters of the plain, although they dwelt in some parts of it (see on Exodus 13:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Caleb stilled the people. That Caleb alone is named here, whereas Joshua is elsewhere joined with him in the matter (as in chapter Numbers 14:6, 30), has been considered strange; but it is not difficult to supply a probable explanation. Joshua was the special companion and minister of Moses, his alter ego in those things wherein he was employed: for that reason he may very well have given place to Caleb as a more impartial witness, and one more likely to be listened to in the present temper of the people; for it is evident from Deuteronomy 1, that that temper had already declared itself for evil (see on Numbers 14:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For they are stronger than we. In point of numbers the enormous superiority of the Israelites over any combination likely to oppose them must have been evident to the most cowardly. But the existence of numerous walled and fortified towns was (apart from Divine aid) an almost insuperable obstacle to a people wholly ignorant of artillery or of siege operations; and the presence of giants was exceedingly terrifying in an age when battles were a series of personal encounters (cf. 1 Samuel 17:11, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - A land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof. This cannot mean that the people died of starvation, pestilence, or other natural causes, which would have been contrary to facts and to their own report. It must mean that the population was continually changing through internecine wars, and the incursions of fresh tribes from the surrounding wastes. The history of Palestine from first to last testifies to the constant presence of this d anger. The remarkable variation in the lists of tribes inhabiting Canaan may be thus accounted for. All the people... are men of great stature, אֲגְשֵׁי מִדּות \"men of measures. \" Septuagint, ἄνδρες ὑπερμήκεις. The \"all\" is an exaggeration very natural to men who had to justify the counsels of cowardice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers13:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants, אֶת־הַנְּפִילים בְּנִי עַנָק מִן־הַנְּפִלים. The Nephilim, Beni-Anak, of the Nephilim. The Septuagint has only τοὺς γίγαντας. The Nephilim are, without doubt, the primaeval tyrants mentioned under that name in Genesis 6:4. The renown of these sons of violence had come down from those dim ages, and the exaggerated fears of the spies saw them revived in the gigantic forms of the Beni-Anak. There is no certainty that the Nephilim had been giants, and no likelihood whatever that the Beni-Anak had any real connection with them. As grasshoppers. We have no means of judging of the actual size of these men, unless the height assigned to Goliath (six cubits and a span) be allowed to them. Probably men of this stature were quite exceptional even among the Anakim. The report of the spies was thoroughly false in effect, although founded on isolated facts.NEWLINE","Num.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.VERSEENDNEWLINEChapter 14:1. - And the people wept that night. As the spies repeated their dismal tidings, each to the leading men of his own tribe, and as the report was spread swiftly through the tents (cf. Deuteronomy 1:27) with ever-increasing exaggerations, the lamentation became universal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Murmured against Moses and against Aaron; whom they probably suspected and accused of seeking their own personal ends. Here we may see the true reason why Joshua had not been put forward to advocate an immediate advance. The Septuagint has διεγόγγυζον (cf. 1 Corinthians 10:10). Would God we had died. לוּ־מָתְנוּ. Septuagint, ὄφελον ἀπεθάνομεν. The A.V. is unnecessarily strong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Wherefore hath the Lord brought us. Rather, \"wherefore doth the Lord bring us.\" מֵבִיא. Septuagint, εἰσάγει. They were not actually in the land yet, but only on the threshold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. Although this was only proposed in the wildness of their distress, yet it was a height of rebellion to which they had never risen before. They had lamented that they had not died in Egypt, and they had wished themselves back in Egypt, but they had never proposed to take any overt steps towards returning thither. Nothing less than an entire and deliberate revolt was involved in the wish to elect a captain for themselves, for the angel of the covenant was the Captain of the Lord's host (Joshua 5:14, 15). The proposal to depose him, and to choose another in his place, marked the extremity of the despair, the unbelief, and the ingratitude of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Moses and Aaron fell on their faces. After making ineffectual efforts to reason with the people, or rather with their leaders (Deuteronomy 1:29-31). It was not, however, in this case an attitude of intercession, but the instinctive action of those who await in silent horror a catastrophe which they see to be inevitable; it testified to all who saw it that they were overwhelmed with shame and sorrow in view of the awful sin of the people, and of the terrible punishment which must follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And Joshua. In a last hopeless effort to bring the people to a better mind, or at least to deliver their own souls, there was no reason why Joshua should hold back any more. Rent their clothes. Another token of grief and horrer practiced from patriarchal times (cf. Genesis 37:29, 34; Job 1:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - If the Lord delight in us. An expression used by Moses himself (Deuteronomy 10:15). It did indeed place the whole matter in the only right light; all the doubt that could possibly exist was the doubt implied in that \"if.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They are bread for us. \"They are our food,\" i.e., we shall easily devour them (cf. Numbers 24:8; Psalm 14:4). Perhaps it has the further significance that their enemies would be an absolute advantage to them, because they would (however unwillingly) supply them with the necessaries of life. So apparently the Septuagint: μὴ φοβηθῆτε τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς ὅτι κατάβρωμα ὑμῖν ἐστιν. <ΒΤΤ·Ξομμενταρψ Ωορδ>Their defense is departed from them. Literally, \"their shadow,\" that which shielded them for a while from the fierce blast of Divine wrath. This \"shadow\" was not positively the Divine protection (as in Psalm 91:1, and elsewhere), but negatively that Providence which left them a space wherein to walk in their own ways (cf. τὸ κατέχον of 2 Thessalonians 2:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Bade stone them with stones. Angry people cannot endure the counsels of calm reason, and perhaps the hostility which they felt against Moses they were very ready to vent upon his \"minister.\" The glory of the Lord appeared., before all the children of Israel. At the moment when they were about to proceed to violence, the Divine glory filled the tabernacle, and flashed forth with a brilliancy which compelled their awe. struck attention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the Lord said unto Moses, who had, as we may suppose, risen and drawn nigh when the glory of the Lord appeared.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. By electing Moses, in the place of Jacob, to be the founder and ancestor of the chosen race, God would still have made good his promises to Abraham, and would only have vindicated for himself the same freedom of choice which he had used in the case of Ishmael and of Esau. We cannot, however, regard this offer as embodying a deliberate intention, for we know that God did not really mean to cast off Israel; nor can we regard it as expressing the anger of the moment, for it is not of God to be hasty. We must understand it distinctly as intended to try the loyalty and charity of Moses, and to give him an opportunity of rising to the loftiest height of magnanimity, unselfishness, and courage. Moses would unquestionably have been less noble than he was if he had listened to the offer; it is therefore certain that the offer was only made in order that it might be refused (cf. Exodus 32:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And Moses said unto the Lord. The words which follow are so confused, and the construction so dislocated, that they afford the strongest evidence that we have here the ipsissima verba of the mediator, disordered as they were in the moment of utterance by passionate earnestness and an agonizing fear. Had Moses been ever so eloquent, a facility of speech at such a moment would have been alike unnatural and unlovely. What we can see in the words is this: that Moses had no thought for himself, and that it never occurred to him to entertain the tempting offer made to him by God; that he knew God too well, and (if we may say so) cared for God too much, to let him so compromise his honour among the nations, and so thwart his own purposes, without making one effort (however audacious) to turn his wrath aside. We can see that it is (as in Exodus 32:11, 12, only much more boldly and abruptly) the thought of what the heathen would say which he wishes to thrust upon the Almighty; but we cannot be sure of the right translation of the words. The most literal rendering would seem to be, \"Both the Egyptians have heard (וְשָׁמְעוּ) that thou broughtest out this people from among them with thy might, and they have told it (וְאָמְרוּ) to the inhabitants of this land; they have heard (שָׁמְעוּ, repeated) that thou, Lord, art amongst this people,\" &c. The Septuagint, however, translates the first verb by a future (καὶ ἀκούσεται Αἴγυπτος), and, as this gives a much clearer sense, it is followed by the Targum Palestine and most of the versions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land. Moral or religious difficulties could not be comprehended by those heathen nations as standing in the way of God's purposes. Physical hindrances were the only ones they could understand; and they would certainly infer that if he slew the Israelites in the wilderness, it could only be in order to cover his own defeat and failure before the rival deities of Palestine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great. Here the argument of Moses rises to a higher level; he ventures to put God in mind of what he had himself declared to Moses in the fullest revelation which he had ever made of his own unchangeable character, viz., that of all Divine prerogatives, the most Divine was that of forgiving sins and showing mercy. According as thou hast spoken. See on Exodus 34:6, 7. The words are not quoted exactly as there given, but are substantially the same.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - From Egypt until now. From the first passion of despair in Egypt itself (Exodus 14:11, 12), through the murmurings in the wilderness of Sin, and the apostasy of Mount Sinai, to the last rebellion at Kibroth-Hattaavah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I have pardoned. Whatever necessary exceptions and qualifications might remain to be afterwards declared, the great fact that he forgave the nation, and that the nation should not die, is announced without delay and without reservation (cf. 2 Samuel 12:13). According to thy word. Such power had God been pleased to give unto man, that at the intercession of the mediator a whole nation is delivered from imminent death and destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord. Rather, \"as truly as I live, and the glory of the Lord shall fill all the earth.\" Both clauses are dependent on יְאוּלָם, and the second is but the necessary correlative of the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Because all those men. The particle כִּי is not to be rendered \"because;\" it simply introduces the substance of the oath: \"As I live... all those men... shall not see.\" So the Septuagint. And have tempted me now these ten times. It is not in the least necessary to press this expression, borrowed from the vague usage of men, literally. It is the language of indignation, meaning that the full measure of provocation had been received (cf. Genesis 31:7; Job 19:3). The recorded instances of national \"temptations\" cannot be made to reach the number ten.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Surely they shall not see. אִםאּיּרְאוּ, \"if they shall see,\" according to the usual Hebrew idiom. Cf. Psalm 107:11 (Septuagint), Hebrews 4:3, ὡς ὤμοσα... εἰ εἰσελεύσονται.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - My servant Caleb. Caleb alone is mentioned here, as if he were the only exception to the sentence just passed upon the generation which came out of Egypt. Taken in connection with Numbers 13:30, and in contrast with Numbers 14:6, 30, 38, it has been supposed to point to the interweaving here of two narratives, from the one of which the name of Joshua was intentionally omitted (see the Introduction). The fact, however, is that Joshua is not the only, nor the most remarkable, exception to the general sentence which is not specified here. Moses and Aaron themselves were undoubtedly not included in that sentence at this time, although they afterwards came under the severity of it (see on Deuteronomy 1:37). Eleazar, the priest, was one of those who entered with Joshua (Joshua 14:1), and it is vain to argue that he might have been under twenty at the time of the numbering (cf. Numbers 4:16). There is, indeed, every reason to believe that the whole tribe of Levi were excepted from the punishment, because they were not compromised in the guilt. They had no representative among the spies, nor were they called upon to go up and fight; moreover, they had been steadily loyal to Moses since the matter of the golden calf. But if the exception of the Levites was taken for granted, and passed without mention, much more might the exception of Joshua. He did not stand by any means in the same position as Caleb and the other spies; he was the \"minister\" and lieutenant of Moses, whose fortunes were obviously bound up, not with those of his tribe, but with those of his master. If Moses had accepted the Divine offer to make him the head of a new chosen race, no doubt Joshua would have been given to him. His subsequent separation as leader, not of Ephraim, but of Israel, was already anticipated in the singularity, at least, of his position. Caleb, on the other hand, was merely a chieftain of the tribe of Judah, with nothing to distinguish him from the mass of the people but his own good conduct. There is, therefore, nothing perplexing in the fact that Caleb alone is mentioned in this place, and nothing to warrant the assumption of a double narrative. Another spirit. The spirit which possessed and prompted Caleb was no doubt the Holy Spirit, just as the spirit which moved the rebellion was an evil spirit (Ephesians 2:2); but how far any such personality is here attributed to the \"spirit\" is hard to determine. Hath followed me fully. Literally, \"fulfilled to walk behind me.\" Caleb treasured up this testimony with natural pride (cf. Joshua 14:8). And his seed shall possess it, i.e., a portion of it and in it. No mention is made here of any special heritage, nor is it clear from Joshua 14:6-13 that Caleb received any definite promise of Hebron. He spoke indeed of a promise made him, probably at this time, by Moses; but that promise was a very general one. He asked for \"this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day;\" but he may only have referred to the Divine command first to explore and then to occupy \"the mountain,\" as the nearest portion of the promised land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley. This parenthesis bears on the face of it several difficulties, both as to the meaning of the statement and as to its position in the text.NEWLINENEWLINE1. It has been stated just before (Numbers 13:29) that the \"Canaanites\" dwelt by the sea, and in the Ghor, and it has been proposed by some to understand under this name the Phoenicians, because \"Sidon\" was the first-born of Canaan, and because they are known to have occupied the coast. But if \"Canaanite\" means \"Phoenician\" in chapter Numbers 13:29, it is difficult to maintain that it is here equivalent to \"Amorite.\" Again, if \"Canaanite\" be taken in this vaguer sense, yet it is clear that the Amorites dwelt in \"the mountain\" (cf. e.g., verse 45 with Deuteronomy 1:44), and not in the lowlands. This has been got over by supposing that עֵמֶק may mean an upland vale, or plateau, such as that to which the Israelites presently ascended. It is, however, a straining of the word to assign such a meaning to it. It is rightly translated by the Septuagint ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι. And even if one looking down from above might call an upland plain by this name, yet certainly one looking up from below would not. If the word stands rightly in this place, בָּעֵמֶק must mean \"in the Wady Murreh,\" the broad sandy strait which bounded the \"mountain of the Amorite\" on the south. If so, we must conclude that not only the roving Amalekites, but also the Canaanites, or Amorites, had established themselves in some parts of the Wady.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It is scarcely credible that an observation of this sort, which would seem unusual and abrupt in any speech, should have formed a part of God's message to Moses. It has no apparent connection with the context. It does not (as often alleged) afford a reason for the command which follows; it was not at all because enemies were already in possession before them that the Israelites had to turn their backs upon the promised land, but because God had withdrawn for the time his promised aid. If the \"valley\" be the Rakhmah plateau, they had always known that hostile tribes held it, and that they would have to conquer them. That the words are an interpolation, as the A.V. represents them, seems as certain as internal evidence can make it; lint by whom made, and with what intent, is a question which will probably never be answered. It may be worth while to hazard a conjecture that the interpolated words are really connected with what goes before, viz., the promise of inheritance to Caleb. Now that promise was fulfilled in the gift of Hebron to Caleb and his seed (Joshua 14:14). But we have express mention in Genesis 37:14 of the \"vale of Hebron,\" and the same word, עֵמֶק, is used in the Hebrew. Is it not possible that this parenthesis was originally the gloss of one who had a special interest in the heritage of Caleb, and wished to note that at the time it was given to him \"the vale\" was occupied by two hostile peoples?

It was not altogether a threat, for it implied that the Lord would be their Shepherd and would provide for their wants in their wanderings. Forty years. This period was made up by counting in the year and a half since the exodus. It was one of those many cases in which the word of God was fulfilled in the meaning and substance of it, but not in the letter. The delay which had already occurred was itself practically due to the same spirit of mutiny which had grown to a head at Kadesh; it was therefore strictly equitable to count it as part of the punishment inflicted (see on Deuteronomy 2:14). And bear your whoredoms. \"Whoredom\" had been already used (Exodus 34:16) as a synonym for idolatry in its aspect of spiritual unfaithfulness, and there is no reason to depart from that well-marked meaning here. That the Jews were guilty of idolatry in the wilderness is distinctly asserted (cf. Acts 7:42, 43); and these idolatrous practices, carried on no doubt in secret, must have been a sore trial to the generation which grew up amidst them (cf. Joshua 24:14, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - After the number of the days... each day for a year. It is said, and truly, that the connection between the two periods was arbitrary, and that the apparent correspondence lay only upon the surface. Exactly for this reason it was the better fitted to fix itself in the mind of a nation incapable of following a deeper and more spiritual analogy of guilt and punishment. It served the purpose which God had in view, viz., to make them feel that the quantity as well as the quality of their punishment was entirely due to themselves; and it needed no other justification. If God assigns reasons at all, he assigns such as can be understood by those to whom he speaks. Ye shall know my breach of promise. תְּנוּאָתִי. The noun only occurs elsewhere in Job 33:10, but the verb is found in Numbers 32:7 in the sense of \"discouraging,\" or \"turning away\" (Septuagint, ἰνατί διαστρέφετε). Here it must mean \"my withdrawal,\" or \"my turning aside, from you.\" They should know by sad experience that \"with the froward\" God will \"show\" himself \"froward\" (Psalm 18:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Died by the plague before the Lord. Septuagint, ἐν τῇ πληγῇ. \"Plague\" has here its older signification of \"stroke,\" or visitation of God. We are not told what death they died, but it was sudden and exceptional enough to mark it as the direct consequence of their sinful conduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Early in the morning. Wishing to anticipate the retrograde movement commanded by God (verse 25). Into the top of the mountain. What summit is here spoken of as the object of their enterprise is quite uncertain. Probably it was some ridge not far distant which seemed to them from below to be the height of land, but was itself commanded by loftier heights beyond. For we have sinned. The prospect of being taken at their own word, and being excluded from the land which lay so near, brought home to them a sense of their folly; but their repentance merely consisted in a frantic effort to avoid the punishment which their sin had incurred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And Moses said, i.e., had said, before they left the camp (cf. verse 44, and Deuteronomy 1:42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - They presumed to go up. This gives the sense very well: they were deaf to all persuasion or command to stay. Septuagint, διαβιασάμενοι ἀνέβησαν. Thus they added to an evil distrust in the power of God an almost more evil trust in their own power. It does not seem correct to say that \"unbelief\" was the real cause of both errors - unbelief, firstly in God's promises, and secondly in his threats. It was rather one of those many cases in which men seek to atone for a fault on one side by rushing into as great a fault on the other side. They spoke brave words about the \"place which the Lord hath promised,\" as though it were indeed obedience and trust which spurred them on, instead of presumption and selfishness. The ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. The plainest possible token that the Lord was not with them. With Moses remained no doubt all the Levites, and the silver trumpets, and Joshua, and perhaps the bulk of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers14:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites. See on Deuteronomy 1:44. They came down from the summit of the mountain country, and drove the Israelites off the saddle, or lower level, to which they had ascended. Discomfited them. Septuagint, κατέκοψαν αὐτούς, \"cut them up.\" Unto Hormah. This mention of Hormah is extremely perplexing, especially when we find from Deuteronomy 1:44 that it was \"in Serf\" (בְּשֵׂעִיר), which is the ordinary name for the territory of the Edomites. The name Hormah meets us again in Numbers 21:3 (see the notes there), as having been bestowed by the Israelites upon the place where they destroyed the people of King Arad. If this be the same Hormah, it must be so named here by anticipation. It is, however, quite possible that it is another place altogether. Again, if the Seir of Deuteronomy 1:44 be the country usually so called, we must suppose that the Edomites had at this time occupied a part of the Azazimeh, contiguous to the Wady Murreh, and westwards of the Arabah. We should then represent the Israelites to ourselves as being driven off the mountain, and across the Wady Murreh, and cut down in the mountains beyond, as far as a place called Hormah, perhaps from this very slaughter. Others have found Hormah (or Zephath, Judges 1:17) and Seir among the multitudinous names of past or present habitation in the south of Palestine; the perplexing resemblances of which, coupled with the vagueness of the sacred narrative, lead to the rise of as many different theories as there are commentators. It must, however, be erroneous to represent this hasty incursion of the Israelites, without their leaders, and without their daily food from heaven, as a campaign in which they advanced for a considerable distance, and were only partially expelled at last. It is clear from this passage, and still more from the parallel passage in Deuteronomy 1, that the expedition was swiftly and ignominiously repelled and avenged. Compare the expression, \"chased you as bees do.\" NOTE TO CHAPTERS XIII, XIV ON THE POSITION OF KADESH AND THE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE ISRAELITES. The old name of Kadesh was En-mishpat (Genesis 14:7), or the \"Well of Judgment.\" Its later and more familiar name was equivalent to \"the sanctuary\" or \"holy place\" (compare the Arabic name for Jerusalem, \"El Kuds\"). It is possible that it received this name from the long sojourn of the tabernacle in its neighbourhood (Deuteronomy 1:46); but it is more likely that it possessed some character of sanctity from ancient times, a character which would very well harmonize with the fact that justice was administered there. It is evident that in order to obtain any clear and connected idea of the history of Israel between the departure from Sinai and the encampment upon the plains of Moab, it is above all necessary to fix approximately the position of this place, which for one generation was the most important place in the whole world. It was no doubt from the neighbourhood of Kadesh that the spies were sent, and it was certainly to Kadesh that they returned from searching the land (Numbers 13:26). From Kadesh the first disastrous attempt was made to invade the country, and from thence again the final journey began which led the nation round the coasts of Edom to the plains of Moab. Thus Kadesh was of all places, next to Mount Sinai, the one associated with the most momentous events of those momentous years, marking at once the terminus of their first journey (which should have been their last), the beginning of their tedious wanderings, and the starting point of their final march. So far, however, from there being any certainty or agreement as to the site of Kadesh, we find two sites proposed widely separated from one another, each maintained and each assailed by powerful arguments, which divide between them the suffrages of geographers and commentators; and besides these there are others less powerfully supported. The view adopted in the notes to this book is that of the travelers Rowland and Williams, and of the great majority of the German commentators: it is fully stated and minutely argued in Kurtz's 'History of the Old Covenant' (volume 3 in Clark's 'Foreign Theol. Lib.'). According to these authorities Kadesh is to be recognized in the plain and fountain of Kudes, just within the north-west corner of the mountains of the Azazimeh (see note on Numbers 10:12). This desert plain, some ten miles by six in extent, is screened from ordinary observation by the outer mountain walls of the Azazimat, which shut it off on the west from the desert road from Sinai to Hebron, on the north from the Wady Murreh. At the north-east of the plain is a bold and bare rock, a promontory of the northern mountain rampart, from the. foot of which issues a copious spring, which begins by falling in cascades into the bed of a torrent, and ends by losing itself in the sands. Amongst the Wadys which open into the plain is one which bears the name of Redemat (see note on Numbers 12:16). It is uncertain whether there is any easy communication between this plain and the Wady Murreh, but there are several passes on the western side which lead by a slight circuit to the southern table-lands of Palestine. The view adopted by the majority of English commentators is that of the traveler Robinson. According to these authorities Kadesh must be sought in the Arabah, the broad depression which runs northward from the head of the Elanitic Gulf until it meets the Ghor below the Dead Sea. By most of those who hold this view the site of Kadesh is placed at Ain-el-Weibeh, ten miles to the north of Mount Hor, and opposite the opening (from the east)of the Wady el Ghuweir, which affords the only easy passage through Edom to the north-west. Others, however, prefer Ain Hash, a few miles further north. The local peculiarities of either place are such as to satisfy the requirements of the narrative, although they would not by themselves have recalled the scenes with which Kadesh is associated. Of other theories none perhaps need to be considered here, because none can reasonably enter into competition with the two already mentioned; they avoid none of the difficulties with which these are beset, while they incur others of their own. If, indeed, Rabbinical tradition (followed in this case by Jerome) were worth anything, it would decide the question in favour of Petra, the Aramaic name of which (Rekem) uniformly takes the place of Kadesh in the Syriac and Chaldee, and in the Talmud. Kadesh-Barnea in the Targums is Rekem-Geiah. Petra itself (of which the ancient name apparently was Selah (2 Kings 14:7), the very word used in Numbers 20:10, 11) stands in a gorge famous for its giant cliffs, still called the Wady Musa, concerning which the local tradition is that it was cleft by the rod of Moses. But apart from these resemblances of name, which are so fallacious, and these legends, which are so worthless, there is absolutely nothing to connect Kadesh with Petra; on the contrary, the position of Petra, far away from Palestine, on the skirts of Mount Hor, and in the heart of Edom, distinguish it sharply from the Kadesh of the Bible story. The two can only be identified on the supposition that the sacred narrative, as it stands, is mistaken and misleading. In examining briefly the arguments by which the western and eastern sites respectively are maintained and assailed, it will be better to dismiss the evidence (such as it is) afforded by modern nomenclature, which is always open to grave suspicion, and is at best of very variable value. The Wady Retemat, e.g., is so named from the broom plant, which is very plentiful in the peninsula, and may have lent a similar name to many another place. In favour of the western site, that of the so-called plain of Kudes, we have the following arguments in addition to the marked natural features which suggested the identification.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Previous mentions of Kadesh would certainly dispose us (in the absence of any indication that there was more than one place of that name) to look for it to the south of Palestine, and rather to the south-west than to the southeast. In Genesis 14:7 it is mentioned in connection with the \"country of the Amalekites,\" which was apparently between Canaan and Egypt. In the same region we may place with more confidence the well of Hagar (Genesis 16:14), which is placed between \"Kadesh and Bered.\" It is difficult to think that this Kadesh could possibly have been in the Arabah. Gerar, again, which was certainly near to Beersheba, is placed (Genesis 20:1) \"between Kadesh and Shut.\" These notices are indeed indefinite, but they certainly point to the western rather than to the eastern site.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Subsequent mentions of Kadesh point in the same direction. In chapter Numbers 34:4, 5 and Joshua 15:3, 4 the southern frontier of Judah, which was also that of Canaan, is traced from the scorpion cliffs at the head of the Ghor to the Mediterranean (see note on the first passage). On this frontier Kadesh occurs in such a way that we should look for it not at one extremity, but somewhere about the middle of the line. The same is still more clearly the case in Ezekiel 47:19, where only three points are given on the southern frontier, of which Kadesh is the middle one. It is, again: very difficult to imagine that this Kadesh could have been in the Arabah.NEWLINENEWLINE3. It is a weaker argument, but still of some moment, that Kadesh is pointedly said to have been in the \"wilderness of Paran\" (Numbers 12:16; Numbers 13:3), and also to have been in or near the wilderness of Zin (chapter 13:21; 20:1). But the eastern site of Kadesh far up the Arabah does not seem to answer to this double description near]y as well as the western. The plain of Kudes is strictly within the limits of that southern desert now called et-Tih, and yet it is quite close to the Wady Murreh, which with its sandy expansions towards the east may well have been the wilderness of Zin (see note on Numbers 13:21). In favour of the eastern site, the only argument of real weight is founded upon the repeated statement that Kadesh was close upon the territory of Edom. In Numbers 20:16, e.g., it is spoken of to the king of Edom as \"a city in the uttermost of thy borders.\" But the only position in which the children of Israel would be at once on the borders of Canaan and on the borders of Edom as commonly understood, would be in the neighbourhood of Ain el-Weibeh, with the pass of es-Safah on their left, and the Wady Ghuweir on their right, as they looked northwards. With this agrees the statement that they came to Kadesh \"by the way of Mount Seir\" (Deuteronomy 1:2), and the fact that there is no station mentioned between Kadesh and Mount Her (Numbers 33:37), although the western site is seventy miles from that mountain. The necessity indeed of placing Kadesh on the border of Edom must be conclusive in favour of the eastern site, if the common assumption is correct that the name and territory of Edom were bounded westwards by the Arabah. It is, however, contended, with some show of reason, that the kings of Edom had extended their authority at this time over the country of the Azazimeh as far as the plain of Kudes. There is, at any rate, nothing improbable in this, because this great mountain fastness is almost as sharply severed from Canaan as from Mount Seir, properly so called; and in fact it never appears to have been in possession of the Canaanites. When, however, the southern boundary line is traced in detail (Numbers 34:3, 4; Joshua 15:1, 2, 21), it is said to have extended עַל־יְדֵי, \"on the sides,\" or אֶל־גְּבוּל, \"to the borders,\" of Edom, and this expression can hardly be satisfied by the single point of contact at the south-east corner of Judah, especially when we consider the long list of cities which were on or near this border (Joshua 15:21-32). Again, when the extreme southern and northern points of Joshua's conquest are mentioned (Joshua 11:17; Joshua 12:7), the former is \"the bald mountain which goeth up Seir\" - a natural feature which we look for in vain (for it cannot possibly be the low line of the scorpion cliffs), unless it be the northern rampart of the Azazimat. We have seen that the Hormah to which the Israelites were repelled on their first invasion is placed (Deuteronomy 1:44) \"in Seir,\" which can hardly be Mount Seir in its ordinary restricted sense. If the name Seir has to be sought anywhere outside of Edom proper, it would seem more natural to find it in the northern part of the wilderness of Paran, where it is said to be still common, than anywhere else. And if this extension of Edom can be established, there appears to be no further objection of any moment to the western site. Mount Hor would still be on the coast or edge of the land of Edom, because it would be the meeting-point of the two boundaries, the one striking westwards across the Arabah, the other southwards down the Arabah. The absence of any name between Kadesh and Her is not conclusive, because the people certainly made journeys of several days without any regular halt (see note on chapter Numbers 10:33). Upon the whole the question may fairly be stated thus: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The general tenor of the narrative would lead us to suppose that the host of Israel had marched from Sinai through the midst of the desert of Paran, by the route which led most directly to the extreme south of Palestine; and if they did this, they must have passed near to Rowland's Kadesh.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The natural features of this site, its position with regard to the desert of et-Tih and the Wady Murreh, its distance from Sinai (Deuteronomy 1:2), and its proximity to the Negeb and the plateau of Rakhmah, seem to harmonize better with all that we read about Kadesh than the corresponding characteristics of the rival site.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The general effect of the various mentions of Kadesh, both before and after, is undeniably, though not decidedly, in favour of the western site.NEWLINENEWLINE4. The minor arguments which are urged on one side or the other may be allowed to balance one another, for it is certain that neither is free from difficulty.NEWLINENEWLINE5. The difficulty with respect to Edom is a very serious one, and with many will be decisive against Rowland's Kadesh.NEWLINENEWLINE6. What must turn the scale one way or the other is the independent evidence that the border of Edom extended at this time across the Arabah, and included the northeast portion of the desert of Paran, viz., the mountain mass which fronted the southern edge of Canaan. There is some evidence that this was the case, and it cannot be met by the simple assertion that the territory of Edom consisted only of Mount Seir, and that Mount Seir lay wholly to the east of the Arabah. It is to be expected that travel and research in these regions now so inaccessible, and, after all said and written, so little known, will before long bring fresh and more decisive evidence to light. In the mean time that view is consistently maintained in these notes which, if it had apparently the greatest difficulty to surmount, yet receives the greatest amount of positive support from the general and incidental testimony of the Scripture record. One lesson emerges clearly from the obscurity involving this question, which appears to us so important to the understanding of God's holy word: the geography of the Bible must be of very small importance indeed as compared with its moral and religious teachings. These are not affected by any ignorance of localities and routes. The rebellion of Kadesh has exactly the same moral for us (Hebrews 3:19; Hebrews 4:11) whether Kadesh was in the Azazimat or the Arabah; and the very uncertainty in which its site is involved may be designed to remind us that it is very easy to exaggerate the value of these outward details to the neglect of those inward teachings which alone are in the highest sense important.NEWLINENEWLINE","Num.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake unto Moses.

Why that legislation should have had the fragmentary and unfinished character which it so evidently bears, requiring to be supplemented, here by an isolated commandment, and there by oral tradition, is an interesting and difficult question; but there can be no doubt as to the fact, and it is superfluous to look any further for the reason of the enactments here following.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When ye be come into the land.

A thing which the younger Israelites, few of whom had ever tasted bread, must have eagerly looked forward to (see on Joshua 5:11, 12). An heave offering. See on Exodus 29:27; Leviticus 7:14. The dedication of first-fruits had been ordered in general terms in Exodus 22:29; Exodus 23:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - A cake of the first of your dough. עַרִסֹת, only used here and in the two passages which refer to this enactment (Nehemiah 10:87; Ezekiel 44:30). It probably means whole meal coarsely ground, the first preparation of the new corn available for baking and eating. Septuagint has ἀπαρχὴ φυράματος, an expression used by St. Paul in Romans 11:16. As... the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall ye heave it, i.e., the offering of bread from the home was to be made in addition to the offering of ears or grains from the threshing-floor, and in the same manner. No doubt this latter offering was a very ancient (Genesis 4:3) and general one, but it is not clearly described in the Law (see, however, Leviticus 2:14; Leviticus 23:10). All these heave offerings were the perquisite of the priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And if ye have erred. The absence of the usual formula, \"and the Lord spake unto Moses,\" is singular, because what follows has reference not to the enactment just made, but to the whole Law. Perhaps it is a part of the thoroughly unscientific and inartificial character of the Mosaic legislation that a principle of extreme importance and wide application is appended to an insignificant matter of ceremonial. Provision is here made for the forgiveness of sins due to ignorance and oversight - a provision which was sorely needed, considering the great complexity of the Law, and the bad training they had for the accurate observance of it (Deuteronomy 12:8). A similar provision had been made in Leviticus 4. The two, however, differ, inasmuch as this contemplates sins of commission, while this contemplates sins of omission.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - From the day that the Lord commanded... and henceforward among your generations. Or, \"thenceforward according to your generations.\" These words are obscure, because they point apparently to a much larger lapse of time since the first giving of the Law than had really occurred. It may be that they include the possibility of fresh revelations of the Divine will in the time to come.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - If ought be committed. Rather, \"if it be committed,\" i.e., the non-observance of \"all these commandments.\" It cannot, however, be necessary to suppose that a falling away from the whole body of the Mosaic legislation is here intended; such an apostasy could not happen by oversight, and if it did, the remedy provided would seem much too slight for the occasion. The analogy of the provision which follows (verse 27), and of the parallel provisions in Leviticus 4:2, 13, points clearly to the neglect of any one of the Divine commandments. One young bullock for a burnt offering. In the case of a sin of commission done ignorantly, the bullock was treated as a sin offering (Leviticus 4:14, 20), for in that case the expiation of guilt incurred is the prominent point in the atonement; in this case it is the necessity of a fresh self-dedication to the Lord. According to the manner, כַּמִּשְׁפָט, according to the ordinance given above. One kid of the goats for a sin offering. This was no doubt offered first, because expiation must precede self-oblation, but the bullock is mentioned first as forming the principal part of the sacrifice. The kid was probably treated according to the regulations of Leviticus 4:14, sq.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Seeing all the people were in ignorance. Literally, \"because (sc. it happened) to the whole nation in ignorance.\" As the stranger was counted as of the nation for religious purposes, he shared both in its sin and in its forgiveness. There is no record of this atonement ever having been made, although there was abundant occasion for it; it may well be that it was intended only to stand on record against the Jews, and to point them to the one true expiation for their national as well as for their particular transgressions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And if any soul sin through ignorance. No doubt by way of omission, as in the preceding case, and thus this regulation will be distinguished from that in Leviticus 4:27. In either case the ritual is apparently intended to be the same, although not so fully described here. In verse 29 the benefit of the ordinance is extended to strangers; this was natural in a law which directly contemplates the residence of Israel in their permanent home.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The soul that doeth... presumptuously. Literally, \"with a high hand,\" i.e., defiantly. A similar phrase is used of God himself (Exodus 13:9). The same reproacheth the Lord, מְגַדֵּפ, revileth. Septuagint, παροξυνεῖ In Ezekiel 20:27 it is translated \"blasphemeth.\" Perhaps \"affronteth\" would be better. He that deliberately broke the commandment of the Lord avowed him. self his open enemy, and, as it were, challenged him to single combat. Cut off. See Genesis 17:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - His iniquity... upon him. עַונָה בָהּ, \"its crime upon it,\" i.e., the sin of that soul must come upon it in punishment.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 15:32-36 THE SABBATH-BREAKER (verses 32-36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness. It is maintained by some that these words were intended to mark the contrast between the previous laws, which were only to be observed when the people came into their own land, and the law of the sabbath, which was strictly enforced during the period of wandering. There is no doubt that such a distinction existed in fact, but there is no reason to find the intentional assertion of it in this expression. The simpler and more natural, and therefore more probable, explanation is, that the incident was recorded after the people had left the wilderness. At the same time, there is nothing unreasonable in ascribing the narrative to Moses himself if we suppose him to have written it at the end of his life, when the people were encamped in the steppes of Moab. It seems probable that the record of the incident was inserted here as an example of a \"presumptuous\" sin, and of its punishment. A man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. This was clearly presumptuous, because the prohibition to do any work for oneself on the sabbath had been made so clear, and was so constantly forced upon their attention by the failure of the manna on that day, that ignorance could not possibly be pleaded here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Unto all the congregation, i.e., unto the council of elders, who were the congregation by representation (see on Exodus 18:25, 26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - They put him in ward, (cf. Leviticus 24:12), because it was not declared what should be done to him. This is perplexing, because the punishment of death had been decreed in Exodus 31:14, 15, and Exodus 35:2. It seems an evasion to say that although death had been decreed, the mode of death had not been fixed; forNEWLINENEWLINE(1) it was clearly part of the Divine answer that the offence was really capital (see verse 35 a), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it was understood that in such cases death was to be inflicted by stoning (see Leviticus 20:2; Leviticus 24:14; Joshua 7:25; in the last case the command was to bum the delinquents with fire, yet it was rightly taken for granted that they were to be stoned to death first). There are only two explanations which are satisfactory because they are honest.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The incident may possibly have occurred between the first institution of the sabbath (Exodus 16:23, 29) and the decree of death to those that broke it. There is nothing in the record as it stands here to contradict such an assumption.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It is more likely that it occurred after the departure from Sinai, and that the hesitation in dealing with the criminal was duo not to any real uncertainty as to the law, but to unwillingness to inflict so extreme and so (apparently) disproportioned a punishment for such an offence without a further appeal. If it be said that such unwillingness to carry out a plain command would have been sinful, it is sufficient to answer that Moses and Aaron and the elders were human beings, and must have shrunk from visiting with a cruel death the trivial breach of a purely arbitrary commandment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Without the camp. That it might not be defiled (cf. Acts 7:58, and Hebrews 13:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And he died. He was killed not for what he did, but for doing it presumptuously, in deliberate defiance of what he knew to be the will of God. If the covenant relation was to be maintained between God and Israel, the observance of the sabbath, which was an integral part of that covenant, must be enforced, and he who willfully violated it must be cut off; and this consideration was of exceptional force in this case, as the first which had occurred, and as the one, therefore, which would govern all the rest (cf. Acts 5:5, 10). On the punishment of stoning see Leviticus 20:2; Leviticus 24:14; Acts 7:58.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 15:37-41 THE LAW OF TASSELS (verses 37-41).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Bid them that they make them fringes. צִיצִת, probably tassels. It seems to signify something flower-like and bright, like the blooms on a shrub; the word צִיצ. is applied to the shining plate of gold upon Aaron's head-band (Exodus 28:36). In Jeremiah 48:9 it seems to mean a wing, and in Ezekiel 8:3 צִיצִת is a lock of hair. The exact meaning must be gathered from the context, and on the whole that suggests a tassel rather than a fringe. The word גְּדִלִיס, used in the parallel passage Deuteronomy 22:12, seems to have this meaning. The Septuagint renders it by κράσπιδα, which is adopted in the Gospels (see on Matthew 23:5). In the borders of their garments. Literally, \"on the wings,\" ἐπὶ τὰ πτερύγια. The outer garment (בֶּגֶד here, כְּסוּת in Deuteronomy 22:12) was worn like a plaid, so folded that the four corners were dependent, and on each of these corners was to be hung a tassel. It was also used as a coverlet by the poor (Exodus 22:27). That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue. Rather, \"that they put a string (or thread) of hyacinth-blue upon the tassel of the wing.\" Septuagint, κλῶσμα ὑακίνθινον. This may have been a blue string with which to fasten the tassel to the corner of the garment, as if it were the stalk on which this flower grew; or it may have been a prominent blue thread in the tassel itself. The later Jews seem to have understood it in this sense, and concerned themselves greatly with the symbolical arrangements of the blue and other threads, and the method in which they were knotted together, so as to set forth the whole law with all its several commandments. The later Jews, however, have always contrived, with all their minute observance, to break the plain letter of the law: thus the modern talith is an under, and not an upper, garment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - That ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments. It was indeed a minute and apparently trivial distinction, and yet such an one as would most surely strike the eye, and through the eye the mind. It was like the facings on a uniform which recall the fame and exploits of a famous regiment. The tasseled Hebrew was a marked man in other eyes, and in his own; he could not pass himself off as one of the heathen; he was perpetually reminded of the special relation in which he stood to the Lord, whose livery (so to speak) - or, to use another simile, whose colours - he wore. No doubt the sky-blue string or thread which was so prominent was meant to remind him of heaven, and of the God of heaven. And that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring. The office of the tassels was to promote a recollected spirit. As it was, their fickle minds were always ready to stray away towards any heathen follies which their restless eyes might light upon. The trivial but striking peculiarity of their dress should recall them to the thought that they were a peculiar people, holy to the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers15:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - I am the Lord your God. This intensely solemn formula, here twice repeated, may serve to show how intimately the smallest observances of the Law were connected with the profoundest and most comforting of spiritual truths, if only observed in faith and true obedience. The whole of religion, theoretical and practical, lay in those words, and that whole was hung upon a tassel. It is further to be noted that this precept was given during the years of exile, and probably given as one which they could keep, and which would be helpful to them, at a time when almost all other distinctive observances were suspended.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now Korah... took men. וַיִּקַּח קֹרַח. The word \"took\" stands alone at the head of the sentence in the singular number. This does not by itself confine its reference to Korah, because it may be taken as repeated after each of the other names; at the same time, the construction suggests that in its original form Korah alone was mentioned, and that the other names were afterwards added in order to include them in the same statement. The ellipsis after \"took\" (if it be one) may be filled up by \"men,\" as in the A.V. and in most versions, or by \"counsel,\" as in the Jerusalem Targum. The Septuagint has in place of יִקַּח ἐλάλησε, representing apparently a different reading. Some commentators regard it as an anacoluthon for \"took two hundred and fifty men... and rose up with them;\" others, again, treat the \"took\" as a pleonasm, as in 2 Samuel 18:18 and elsewhere; but the change of number from וַיִּקַּח to וַיָּקוּטוּ makes it difficult. It seems best to say that the construction is broken and cannot be satisfactorily explained. Indeed there can be no question that the whole narrative, like the construction of the opening verses, is rely confused, and leaves on the mind the impression that it has been altered, not very skillfully, from its original form. The two parts of the tragedy, that concerning the company of Korah, and that concerning the Reubenites, although mingled in the narrative, do not adjust themselves in the mind, and the general effect is obscure. It is sufficient to point out here that no one can certainly tell what became of the ringleader himself, who was obviously the head and front of the whole business. Some are strenuously of opinion that he was swallowed up alive, others as strenuously that he was consumed with fire; but the simple fact is that his death is not recorded in this chapter at all, although he is assumed to have perished. The obscurity which hangs over this passage cannot be traced to any certain cause; the discrepancies and contradictions which have been discovered in it are clue to mistake or misrepresentation; nor can any evil motive be plausibly assigned for the interpolation (if it be such) of that part of the story which concerns the Reubenites. If, for some reason unknown to us, an original narrative of Korah's rebellion was enlarged so as to include the simultaneous mutiny of the Reubenites and their fate; and if, further, that enlargement was so unskillfully made as to leave considerable confusion in the narrative, wherein does that affect either its truth or its inspiration? The supernatural influence which watched over the production of the sacred narrative certainly did not interfere with any of those natural causes which affected its composition, its style, its clearness or obscurity. Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi. On the genealogy of the Levites see Exodus 6:16-22, and above on Numbers 3:17-19. It is generally supposed that some generations are passed over in these genealogies. Korah belonged to the same Kohathite sub-tribe as Moses and Aaron, and was related to them by some sort of cousinship; his father (or ancestor) Izhar was the younger brother of Amram and the elder brother of Uzziel, whose descendant Elizaphan had been made chief of the Kohathites. Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. Eliab himself was apparently the only son of Pallu, the second son of Reuben (Numbers 26:5, 8). If the word \"son\" is to be literally understood in all these cases, then Korah, Dathan, and Abiram would all be great-great-grandsons of Jacob himself. On, the son of Peleth. It is one of the strange obscurities of this narrative that On, who appears here as a ringleader, is never mentioned again either in this chapter or elsewhere. Sons of Reuben. Reubenites. The encampment of their tribe was on the south side of the tabernacle in the outer line (Numbers 2:10), while that of the Kohathites was on the same side in the inner line. Thus they were to some extent neighbours; but see below on verse 24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And they rose up before Moses. It is suggested that the Reubenites were aggrieved because their father had been deprived of his birthright in favour of Judah, and that Korah was aggrieved because the Uzzielites had been preferred in the person of Elizaphan to the Izharites (chapter 3:30). These accusations have nothing whatever in the narrative to support them, and are suspicious because they are so easy and so sure to be made in such cases. In all ecclesiastical history the true reformer, as well as the heretic and the demagogue, has always been charged with being actuated by motives of disappointed ambition. Without these gratuitous suppositions there was quite enough to excite the anger and opposition of such discontented and insubordinate minds as are to be found in every community. With certain of the children of Israel. These were gathered front the tribes at large, as implied in the statement that Zelophehad a Manassite was not amongst them (Numbers 27:8). Famous in the congregation. Literally, \"called men of the congregation.\" Septuagint, σύγκλητοι βουλῆς, representatives of the host in the great council (cf. chapter Numbers 1:16; 26:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. They had risen up before Moses, i.e., made a tumult in his presence, because they regarded him (and rightly) as the actual ruler of Israel in religious as well as in secular matters. At the same time, the attack of Korah and his company (with whom alone the narrative is really concerned here) was directed especially against the ecclesiastical rule which Moses exercised through his brother Aaron. Ye take too much upon you. רַב־לָכֶם, \"much for you,\" probably in the sense of \"enough for you\" (cf. the use of רַב in Genesis 45:28), i.e., you have enjoyed power long enough; so the Targum Palestine. It may, however, be taken with the following כִּי as meaning, \"let it suffice you that all the congregation,\" &c.; and so the Septuagint, ἐχέτω ὑμῖν ὅτι, κ.τ.λ. The Targum of Onkelos renders it in the same sense as the A.V. All the congregation are holy, every one of them. This was perfectly true, m a sense. There was a sanctity which pertained to Israel as a nation, in which all its members shared as distinguished from the nations around (Exodus 19:6; Leviticus 20:26); there was a priesthood which was inherent in all the sons of Israel, older and more indelible than that which was conferred on Aaron's line - a priesthood which, apart from special restrictions, or in exceptional circumstances, might and did assert itself in priestly acts (Exodus 24:5, and compare the cases of Samuel, Elijah, and others who offered sacrifice during the failure of the appointed priesthood). It Moses had taken the power to himself, or it he had (as they doubtless supposed) restricted active priestly functions to Aaron because he was his brother, and wholly under his influence, their contention would have been quite right. They erred, as most violent men do, not because they asserted what was false, but because they took for granted that the truth which they asserted was really inconsistent with the claims which they assailed. The congregation were all holy; the sons of Israel were all priests; that was true - but it was also true that by Divine command Israel could only exercise his corporate priesthood outwardly through the one family which God had set apart for that purpose. The same God who has lodged in the body certain faculties and powers for the benefit of the body, has decreed that those faculties and powers can only be exercised through certain determinate organs, the very specialization of which is both condition and result of a high organization. The congregation of the Lord. There are two words for congregation in this verse: קָהָל here, and עֵדָה before. The former seems to be used in the more solemn sense, but they are for the most part indistinguishable, and certainly cannot be assigned to different authors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He spake unto Korah. That Korah was the mainspring of the conspiracy is evident (cf. verse 22; Numbers 27:3; Jude 1:11 b). It may well be that his position as a prominent Levite and a relation of Moses gave him great influence with men of other tribes, and earned him a great name for disinterestedness and liberality in advocating the rights of all Israel, and in denouncing the exclusive claims and privileges by which he himself (as a Levite) was benefited. It is often assumed that Korah was secretly aiming at the high-priesthood, but of this, again, there is not a shadow of proof; his error was great enough, and his punishment sore enough, without casting upon him these unfounded accusations. It would be more in accordance with human nature if we supposed that Korah was in his way sincere; that he had really convinced himself, by dint of trying to convince others, that Moses and Aaron were usurpers; that he began his agitation without thought of advantage of himself; that, having gained a considerable following and much popular applause, the pride of leadership and the excitement of conflict led him on to the last extremity. The Lord will show who are his. אֶת־אַשֶׁר־לוּ, the meaning of which is defined by the following words, \"whom he hath chosen.\" Moses refers the matter to the direct decision of the Lord; as that decision had originated the separate position of Aaron, that should also vindicate it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Take you censers. מַחְתּות.

The offering of incense was proposed by Moses as a test because it was a typically priestly function, to which the gravest importance was attached (Leviticus 10:1; Leviticus 16:12, 13), and because it was so very simply executed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. רַב־לָכֶם, as in verse 3. The exact meaning of this tu quoque is not apparent. Perhaps he would say that if he and Aaron were usurpers, the whole tribe of Levi were usurpers too.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi. No son of Levi is mentioned in the narrative except Korah, and this address itself passes into the second person singular (verses 10, 11), as though Korah alone were personally guilty. It is possible enough that behind him was a considerable body of public opinion among the Levites more or less decidedly supporting him; but there is no need to impute any general disloyalty to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Seemeth it a small thing to you. Rather, \"is it too little for you.\" חַמְעַט מִכֶּם.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together. It does not follow that Korah was seeking an exclusive dignity for himself; or for his tribe. His \"company\" apparently included representative men from all the tribes, or at least from many (see on verse 2). They were seeking the priesthood because they affirmed it to be the common possession of all Israelites. Against the Lord. It was in his name that they appeared, and to some extent no doubt sincerely; but since they appeared to dispute an ordinance actually and historically made by God himself, it was indeed against him that they were gathered. And what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him? The construction is broken, as so often when we have the ipsissima verba of Moses, whose meekness did not enable him to speak calmly under provocation. The sentence runs, \"For which cause thou and all thy company who arc gathered against the Lord, - and Aaron, who is he, that ye murmur against him?\" It was easy to represent the position of Aaron in an invidious light, as though they were assailing some personal sacerdotal pretensions; but in truth he was only a poor servant of God doing what he was bid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram. The part really taken by these men in the agitation is very obscure. They were not of the two hundred and fifty, nor were they with them when they gathered together against Moses and Aaron - perhaps because they took no interest in ecclesiastical matters, and only resented the secular domination of Moses. Neither can we tell why Moses sent for them at this juncture, unless he suspected them of being in league with Korah (see below on verse 24). We will not come up, i.e., to the tabernacle, as being spiritually the culminating point of the camp.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Is it a small thing. Rather, \"is it too little,\" as in verse 9. A land that floweth with milk and honey. A description applying by right to the land of promise (Exodus 3:8; Numbers 13:27), which they in their studied insolence applied to Egypt. Except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us. Literally, \"that (כִּי) thou altogether lord it over us.\" The expression is strengthened in the original by the reduplication of the verb in the inf. abs., גַּם־הִשְׂתְּרֶרNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Moreover thou hast not brought us. According to the promises (they meant to say) by which he had induced them to leave their comfortable homes in Egypt (Exodus 4:30, 31). Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? i.e., wilt thou blind them to the utter failure of thy plans and promises? wilt thou throw dust in their eyes?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And Moses was very wroth. The bitter taunts of the Reubenites had just enough semblance of truth in them to make them very hard to bear, and especially the imputation of low personal ambition; but it is impossible to say that Moses did not err through anger. Respect not thou their offering. Cf. Genesis 4:4. It is not quite clear what offering Moses meant, since they do not seem to have wished to offer incense. Probably it was equivalent to saying, Do not thou accept them when they approach thee; for such approach was always by sacrifice (cf. Psalm 109:7). I have not taken one ass from them. Cf. 1 Samuel 12:3. The ass was the least valuable of the ordinary live stock of those days (cf. Exodus 20:17). The Septuagint has here οὐκ ἐπιθύμημα οὐδενὸς αὐτῶν εἴληφα, which is apparently an intentional paraphrase with a reference to the tenth commandment (οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις κ.τ.λ.). Neither have I hurt one of them. As absolute ruler he might have made himself very burdensome to all, and very terrible to his personal enemies. Compare Samuel's description of the Eastern autocrat (1 Samuel 8:11-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And Moses said unto Korah. After the interchange of messages with the Reubenites, Moses repeats his injunctions to Korah to be ready on the morrow to put his claims to the test, adding that Aaron too should be there, that the Lord might judge between them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Stood in the door of the tabernacle, i.e., at the door of the court, so that they were visible from the space outside.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And Korah gathered all the congregation against them. It does not follow that the whole congregation was actively or deliberately on Korah's side. But a movement ostensibly in behalf of the many as against the few is sure to enlist a general, if not a deep, sympathy; nor is it to be supposed that Moses and Aaron could escape a large amount of unpopularity under the grievous circumstances of the time. The thoughtless multitude would have hailed their downfall with real though short-lived satisfaction. The glory of the Lord appeared. As before (Numbers 14:10), filling the tabernacle probably, and flashing out before the eyes of allNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeparate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - That I may consume them in a moment. Literally, \"and I will consume them.\" The same thing must be said of this as of Numbers 14:11, 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh. אֵל ךאלֹחֵי הָרוּחֹת לְכָ־בָּשָׂר. The ruach is the spirit of life which the Creator has imparted unto perishable flesh, and made it live. In some sense it belongs to beasts as well as to men (Ecclesiastes 3:19, 21); but in the common use of the word men only are thought of, as having received it by a special communication of a higher order (Genesis 2:7; 1 Corinthians 15:45). Moses, therefore, really appeals to God, as the Author and Giver of that imperishable life-principle which is lodged in the mortal flesh of all men, not to destroy the works of his own hands, the creatures made in his own image. Here we have in its germ that idea of the universal fatherhood of God which remained undeveloped in Jewish thought until Judaism itself expanded into Christianity (cf. Isaiah 63:16; Isaiah 64:8, 9; Acts 17:26, 29). Shall one man sin. Rather, \"the one man (הָאִישׁ) hath sinned,\" i.e., Korah, who had misled all the rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The Lord spake unto Moses. No direct answer was apparently vouchsafed to the remonstrance of Moses and Aaron, but it was tacitly allowed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. The word \"tabernacle\" (mishcan) is the same word which is so translated in verse 9, but not the same which is used in verses 18,19; it properly signifies \"dwelling-place.\" It is certainly the natural conclusion, from the use of this expression here and in verse 27, that this mishcan was something different from the \"tents\" (אָהָלֵי) mentioned in verses 26, 27, and was some habitation common to the three rebels (see below on verse 31). The Septuagint, in order to avoid the difficulty, omits the names of Dathan and Abiram, and has only ἀπὸ τῆς συναγωγῆς Κορέ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Touch nothing of theirs. Because they, and all that belonged to them, were anathema, devoted to destruction. Compare the case of Achan (Joshua 7:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And Dathan and Abiram... stood in the door of their tents. To see what Moses would do. Nothing is said of Korah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Nor I have not done them of mine own mind. Literally, \"that not of my heart\", כִּיאּלֹא מִלִּבּי. Septuagint, ὅτι οὐκ ἀπ ἐμαυτου .NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - If they be visited after the visitation of all men. פָקַד is of somewhat doubtful meaning; it seems to answer to the ἐπίσκεψις and ἐπισκοπὴ of the Septuagint,, and to our \"oversight,\" or \"visitation\" (German, heimsuchung. Thus it may mean practically the providence of God for good, i.e., in the way of protection, or for evil, i.e., in the way of judgment. In either sense providence showed itself in no ordinary form towards these men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Make a new thing. \"Create a creation.\" בְּרִיאָה יִבְרָא. Into the pit. Rather, \"into Sheol.\" שְׁאֹלָה. Septuagint, εἰς ἄδου. Sheol is not \"the pit,\" but Hades, the place of departed spirits (Genesis 37:35; Genesis 42:38), which is regarded, according to the general instinct of mankind, as being \"under the earth\" (cf. Philippians 2:10 b; Revelation 5:13). They were to go down \"quick\" into Sheol, because they were still alive at the moment that they were lost to sight for ever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The ground clave asunder that was under them. As it sometimes does during an earthquake. In this case, however, the event was predicted, and wholly supernatural. The sequence of the narrative would lead us to suppose that the earth opened beneath the tents of Dathan and Abiram in the camp of Reuben. It is difficult to think of the gulf as extending so far as to involve the tent of Korah in the Kohathite lines in the same destruction, while there is nothing to suggest the idea that the earth opened in more than one place. It is true that the camps of the Reubenites and of the Kohathites were more or less contiguous; but when it is remembered that there were 46,500 adult males in the former, and 8600 males in the latter, and that a broad space must have been left between the two lines of encampment, it is obviously improbable that Korah's tent was in a practical sense \"near\" to those of Dathan and Abiram, unless indeed he had purposely removed it in order to be under the protection of his Reubenite partisans. It is very observable that not a word is said here as to the fate of Korah himself. It is implied in verse 40 that he had perished, and it is apparently asserted in Numbers 26:10 that he was swallowed up with Dathan and Abiram (see the note there). On the other hand, Deuteronomy 11:6; Psalm 106:17 speak of the engulfing of the other two without any mention of Korah himself sharing their fate; and while \"all the men that appertained unto Korah\" perished, his own sons did not (Numbers 26:11). On these grounds it is held by most commentators that Korah died by fire among those who offered incense (verse 35). This, however, is untenable, because \"the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense\" are distinctly mentioned as having been his partisans (verse 2), and are always counted exclusive of Korah himself. On the whole, while it is certain that the narrative is very obscure, and the question very doubtful, it seems most agreeable to all the testimonies of Holy Scripture to conclude -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That Korah had left his own place, and had some sort of dwelling (mischan) either in common with Dathan and Abiram, or hard by their tents.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the earth opened and swallowed up the mishcan, of Korah, and the tents of Dathan and Abiram.NEWLINENEWLINE3. That Korah's men (see next verse) and their property were swallowed up with his mishcan, and (as far as we can tell) Korah himself also. If this be correct, then the much disputed heading of the chapter in the A.V. will be right after all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And their houses, i.e., their families, as in Numbers 18:13. And all the men that appertained unto Korah. Literally, \"all the men who to Korah.\" Whether it means his dependants, or his special partisans, is uncertain: Perhaps some had clung to his fortunes in blind confidence when the rest gat up from his mishcan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - At the cry of them. לְקֹלָם, \"at the noise of them;\" at the mingled sound of their shrieks and of the natural convulsion amidst which they disappeared.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - There came out a fire from the Lord. The fire probably flashed out from the sanctuary with the destructive force of lightning. The two hundred and fifty men. These had remained swinging their censers before the gate of the tabernacle while Moses and (presumably) Korah himself had gone to the camp of Reuben.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Speak unto Eleazar. This is the first time that any special duty is assigned to Eleazar, who was destined to succeed to the high-priesthood. We may suppose that he was sent instead of his father because the duty of gathering up the censers could hardly have been carried out without incurring legal defilement by contact with the dead. Out of the burning. Or, \"out of the burnt.\" Septuagint, ἐκ μέσου τῶν κατακεκαυμένων. From amongst the charred and smouldering corpses. Scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. The censers had been made holy even by that sacrilegious dedication, and must never revert to any common uses; for the same reason the live coals which still remained in them were to be emptied out in a separate place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - These sinners against their own souls, בְּנַפְשֹׁתָם, \"against their own lives.\" The thought is not that they had ruined their souls, but that they had forfeited their lives. The Pentateuch does not contemplate any consequences of sin beyond physical death. The same phrase occurs in Proverbs 20:2. For a covering of the altar. The altar of burnt incense. The censers were no doubt brazen pans, and when beaten out would form plates which could be affixed to the boards of which the frame of the altar was composed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - That he be not as Korah. וְלֹא־יִחְיֶח. That he do not meet with the same fate as Korah.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 16:41-50 THE PLAGUE BEGUN AND AVERTED (verses 41-50).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Ye have killed the people of the Lord. They had in truth forfeited their own lives, and Moses and Aaron had no more part in their death than St. Peter had in the death of Ananias and Sapphira. But it was easy to represent the matter as a personal conflict between two parties, in which the one had triumphed by destroying the other. In speaking of Korah and his company as the \"people of the Lord,\" they meant to say that their lives were as sacred as the lives of Moses and Aaron, and the crime of taking them as great; they did not know, or did not heed, that their own immunity was due to the intercession of those whom they thus charged with sacrilegious murder.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - The cloud covered it. Not soaring above it, as usual, but lying close down upon it, to signify that the presence of the Lord had passed in some special sense into the tabernacle (see on Numbers 12:5, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGet you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Get you up. הֵרֹמּוּ, from רָמַם. The command is substantially the same as that in verse 21. Since it was not obeyed, we must conclude (as before) that it was not intended to be obeyed. They fell on their faces. In horror and dismay. No doubt they would have interceded (as in verse 22), but that Moses perceived through some Divine intimation that wrath had gone forth, and that some more prevailing form of mediation than mere words must be sought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - Take a censer. Rather, \"the censer,\" i.e., the proper censer of the high priest, which he used upon the great day of atonement (Leviticus 16:12), and which is said in Hebrews 9:4 to have been of gold, and to have been kept in the most holy place. It is not, however, mentioned amongst the sacred furniture in the Levitical books. And go quickly. הולֵך Rather, \"take it quickly.\" And make an atonement for them. There was no precedent for making an incense offering alter this fashion, but it was on the analogy of the rite performed within the tabernacle on the day of atonement (Leviticus 16). Whether Moses received any intimation that the wroth might be thus averted, or whether it was the daring thought of a devoted heart when all else failed, it is impossible to say. As it had no precedent, so it never serous to have been repeated; nor is the name or idea of atonement anywhere else connected with the offering of incense apart from the shedding of blood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - And he stood between the dead and the living. If this is to be understood literally, as seems most consistent with the character of the narrative, then the plague must have been strictly local in its character; striking down its victims in one quarter before passing on to another; only thus could it be arrested by the actual interposition of Aaron with the smoking censer. And the plague was stayed. Thus was given to the people the most striking and public proof of the saving efficacy of that mediatorial and intercessory office which they had been ready to invade and to reject. Thus also was it shown that what in profane hands was a savour of death unto death, became when rightly and lawfully used a savour of life unto life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Fourteen thousand and seven hundred. A very large number to have died in the course of a few minutes, as the narrative seems to imply. The plague was undoubtedly of a supernatural character, and cannot be considered as a pestilence or other natural visitation. Beside them that died about the matter of Korah. These wereNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Dathan and Abiram, and their families,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) probably Korah himself,NEWLINENEWLINE(4) possibly some other partisans of Korah (see on verse 32), making in all about 300 souls.NEWLINENEWLINEThus we get the round number of 15,000 as the total of those that perished on this occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers16:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - And the plague was stayed. Not only temporarily, while Aaron stood between the dead and the living, but finally and effectually.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And the Lord spake. Presumably upon the same day, since the design was to prevent any recurrence of the sin and punishment described above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take of every one of them a rod. Literally, \"take of them a rod, a rod,\" i.e., a rod apiece, in the way immediately particularized. מַטֶּה (Septuagint, ῥάβδον,) is used for the staff of Judah (Genesis 38:18) and for the rod of Moses (Exodus 4:2). It is also used in the sense of \"tribe\" (Numbers 1:4, 16). Each tribe was but a branch, or rod, out of the stock of Israel, and, therefore, was most naturally represented by the rod cut from the tree. 'The words used for scepter in Genesis 49:10, and in Psalm 45:7, and for rod in Isaiah 11:1, and elsewhere are different, but the same imagery underlies the use of all of them. Of all their princes... twelve rods. These princes must be those named in chapter 2 and 7. Since among these are to be found the tribe princes of Ephraim and Manasseh, standing upon a perfect equality with the rest, it is evident that the twelve rods were exclusive of that of Aaron. The joining together of Ephraim and Manasseh in Deuteronomy 27:12 was a very different thing, because it could not raise any question as between the two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. There was no tribe prince of Levi, and it is not probable that either of the three chiefs of the sub-tribes (Numbers 3:24, 30, 55) was called upon to bring a rod. This rod was, therefore, provided by Moses himself, and inscribed by him with the name of Aaron, who stood by Divine appointment (so recently and fearfully attested) above all his brethren. For the significance of the act cf. Ezekiel 37:16-28. For one rod... for the head of the house of their fathers. For Levi, therefore, there must be, not three rods inscribed with the names of the chiefs, but one only bearing the name of Aaron, as their common superior.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The tabernacle of the congregation. \"The tent of meeting.\" See on Exodus 30:26.

For the special duty and service of the priesthood (cf. chapter Numbers 16:5). I will make to cease. הַשִׁכֹּתִי מֵעָֹלַי. I will cause to sink so that they shall not rise again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And the rod of Aaron was among the rods. As there was no prince from whom this rod could have come, and as there were twelve rods without it, this must mean that Moses did not keep Aaron's rod separate (which might have caused suspicion), but let it be seen amongst the others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Before the Lord, i.e., in front of the ark. In the tabernacle of witness. \"In the tent of the testimony.\" בּאֹהֶל הָעֵדֻת.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Was budded: or \"sprouted.\" פָּרַח. And yielded almonds. Rather, \"matured almonds.\" This particular rod had been cut from an almond tree, and it would seem probable that it had on it shoots and flowers and fruit at once, so that the various stages of its natural growth were all exemplified together. The almond has its Hebrew name שָׁקֵד, \"awake,\" from the well-known fact of its being the first of all trees to awake from the winter sleep of nature, and to herald the vernal resurrection with its conspicuous show of snow-white blossoms, which even anticipate the leaves (cf. Ecclesiastes 12:5). Thus the \"rod of an almond-tree\" (מַקֵּל שָׁקֵד) was shown to the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:11) as the evident symbol of the vigilant haste with which the purposes of God were to be developed and matured. It is possible that all the tribe princes had official \"rods\" of the almond-tree to denote their watchful alacrity in duty, and that these were the rods which they brought to Moses. In any case the flowering and fruiting of Aaron's rod, while it was an unquestionable miracle (for if not a miracle, it could only have been a disgraceful imposture), was a σημεῖον, in the true sense, i.e., a miracle which was also a parable. Aaron's rod could no more blossom and fruit by nature than any of the others, since it also had been severed from the living tree; and so in Aaron himself was no more power or goodness than in the rest of Israel. But as the rod germinated and matured its fruit by the power of God, supernaturally starting and accelerating the natural forces of vegetable life, even so in Aaron the grace of God was quick and fruitful to put forth, not the signs only and promise of spiritual gifts and energies, but the ripened fruits as well.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And took every man his rod. So that they saw for themselves that their rods remained dry and barren as they were by nature, while Aaron's had been made to live.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Before the testimony. By comparison with verse 7 this should mean before the ark in which the \"testimony\" lay. In Hebrews 9:4, however, the rod is said to have been in the ark, although before Solo-men's time it had disappeared (1 Kings 8:9). We may suppose that after it had been inspected by the princes it was deposited for safer preservation and easier conveyance inside the sacred chest. To be kept for a token against the rebels. Rather, \"against the rebellious,\" literally, \"children of rebellion\" (cf. Ephesians 2:2, 3). It could only serve as a token as long as it retained the evidences of having sprouted and fruited, either miraculously in a fresh state, or naturally in a withered state. As a fact, however, it does not appear that the lesson ever needed to be learnt again, and therefore we may suppose that the rod was left first to shrivel with age, and then to be lost through some accident.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the children of Israel spake unto Moses. It is a mistake to unite these verses specially with the following chapter, for they clearly belong to the story of Korah's rebellion, although not particularly connected with the miracle of the rod. These are the last wailings of the great storm which had raged against Moses and Aaron, which had roared so loudly and angrily at its height, which was now sobbing itself out in the petulant despair of defeated and disheartened men, cowed indeed, but not convinced, fearful to offend, yet not loving to obey.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Shall we be consumed with dying? It was a natural question, considering all that had happened; and indeed it could only be answered in the affirmative, for their sentence was, \"In this wilderness they shall be consumed\" (chapter 14:35). But it was not in human nature that they should calmly accept their fate.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake unto Aaron. This clear and comprehensive instruction as to the position and support of the sons of Aaron on the one hand, and of the Levites on the other, may very naturally have been given in connection with the events just narrated. There is, however, no direct reference to those events, and it is quite possible that the only connection was one of subject-matter in the mind of the writer. That the regulations which follow were addressed to Aaron directly is a thing unusual, and indeed unexampled. The ever-recurring statement elsewhere is, \"the Lord spake unto Moses,\" varied occasionally by \"the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron\" (as in Numbers 2:1; Numbers 4:1; Numbers 19:1); but even where the communication refers to things wholly and peculiarly within the province of Aaron, it is usually made to Moses, and only through him to his brother (see e.g., Numbers 8:1-3). This change in the form of the message may point to a later date, i.e., to a time subsequent to the gainsaying of Korah, when the separate position of Aaron as the head of a priestly caste was more fully recognized than before, and he himself somewhat less under the shadow of his greater brother. Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. Aaron's father's house, according to the analogy of Numbers 17:2, 3, 6, was the sub-tribe of the Kohathites, and these had charge (to the exclusion of the other Levites) of the sanctuary, or rather sacred things (הַמִּקְדָּשׁ, as in Numbers 10:21. Septuagint, τῶν ἁγίων). See on Numbers 4:15. This mention of the Kohathites in connection with the sanctuary is an incidental proof that these instructions were given in view of the wanderings in the wilderness, for after the settlement in Canaan no Levites (as such) came into contact with the sacred furniture. It is not easy to define exactly the meaning of \"shall bear the iniquity (תִּשְׂאוּ אֶת־עַון) of the sanctuary.\" The general sense of the phrase is, \"to be responsible for the iniquity,\" i.e., for anything which caused displeasure in the eyes of God, \"in connection with the sacred things and the service of them;\" hence it meant either to be responsible for such iniquity, as being held accountable for it, and having to endure the penalty, or as being permitted and enabled to take such accountability on oneself, and so discharge it from others. This double sense is exactly reflected in the Greek word αἴρειν, as applied to our Lord (John 1:29). The priests, therefore (and the Kohathites, so far as they had anything to do with the sanctuary), were responsible for all the unholiness attaching or accruing to it, not only by reason of all offences committed by themselves, but by reason of that imperfection which clung to them at the best, and made them unworthy to handle the things of God. In a further and deeper sense they might be said to be vicariously responsible for all the iniquity of all Israel, so far as the taint of it affected the very sanctuary (see on Exodus 28:38; Leviticus 16:16). The iniquity of your priesthood. The responsibility not only for all sinful acts of omission and commission in Divine service (such as those of Nadab and Abihu, and of Korah), but for all the inevitable failure of personal holiness on the part of those who ministered unto the Lord. This responsibility was emphatically recognized and provided for in the rites of the great day of atonement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi. The Levites generally, as distinguished from the Kohathites in particular (see on chapter 3). That they may be joined unto thee. וְילָּווּ, a play upon the name Levi (see on Genesis 29:34). But thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness. The Hebrew has only וְאַתָּה וּבָנֶי אִתָּך, which may be rendered, \"And thou and thy sons with thee (shall be),\" &c., or more naturally read with what goes before, \"that they may minister unto thee; both thee and thy sons with thee,\" &c. The Septuagint and the Targums appear to favour the former rendering, but it is not evident what distinction could be drawn between priests and Levites as to the mere fact of being before the tabernacle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They shall keep thy charge, &c. See on Numbers 3:7, 8. That neither they, nor ye also, die. This warning does not seem to refer to the danger of the Kohathites seeing the sacred things (Numbers 4:15), but of the other Levites coming near them; the further warning, \"nor ye also,\" is added because if the carelessness or profanity of the priest led to sacrilege and death in the case of the Levite, it would be laid to his charge (cf. Numbers 4:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A stranger. וֶר, i.e., one not a Levite, as in Numbers 1:51.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. As there had been ill the case of Korah and his company, and of the many thousands who had fallen in consequence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I have taken your brethren the Levites. See on chapter Numbers 3:9; 8:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Shall keep your priests' office for everything of the altar, and within the vail. That the Levites were made over to Aaron and his sons to relieve them of a great part of the mere routine and drudgery of their service was to be with them an additional and powerful motive for doing their priestly work so reverently and watchfully as to leave no excuse for sacrilegious intrusion. The altar (of burnt offering) and \"that within the vail (cf. Hebrews 6:19) were the two points between which the exclusive duties of the priesthood lay, including the service of the holy place. A service of gift. A service which was not to be regarded as a burden, or a misfortune, or as a natural heritage and accident of birth, but to be received and cherished as a favour accorded to them by the goodness of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the Lord spake unto Aaron. The charge and responsibility of the priests having been declared, the provision for their maintenance is now to be set forth. The charge, מִשְׁמֶרֶת, as in verse 5, &c.; but here it means \"the keeping\" for their own use (cf. Exodus 12:6). Mine heave offerings. תְּרוּמֹתָי. The possessive pronoun marks the fact that these did not belong to the priest in the first instance, although they naturally came to be looked on as his perquisites (cf. 1 Samuel 2:16), but were a gift to him from the Lord out of what the people had dedicated. The word terumoth must here be understood in its widest sense, as including everything which the Israelites dedicated or \"lifted\" of all their possessions, so far as these were not destroyed in the act of offering. Of all the hallowed things. The genitive of identity: \"consisting of all the hallowed things.\" By reason of the anointing. Rather, \"for a portion,\" לְמָשְׁחָה (see on Leviticus 7:35). The Septuagint has εἰς γέρας, \"as an honour,\" or peculium.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Reserved from fire, i.e., from the sacrificial altar. Every oblation of theirs. As specified in the following clauses. The burnt offering is not mentioned because it was wholly consumed, and only the skin fell to the priest. The sin offerings for the priest or for the congregation were also wholly consumed (Leviticus 4:12, 21), but the sin offerings of private individuals, although in no case partaken of by the offerers, were available for the priests (Leviticus 6:26), and this was the ordinary case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In the most holy place thou shalt eat it. בְּקֹדֶשׁ הַדָקֹּשִׁים. Septuagint, ἐν τῷ ἀγίῳ τῶν ἁγίων. This expression is somewhat perplexing, because it stands commonly for the holy of holies (Exodus 26:33). As it cannot possibly have that meaning here, two interpretations have been proposed.NEWLINENEWLINE1. That it means the court of the tabernacle, called \"the holy place\" in Leviticus 6:16, 26; Leviticus 7:6, and there specified as the only place in which the meat offerings, the sin offerings, and trespass offerings might be eaten. There is no reason why this court should not be called \"must holy,\" as well as \"holy;\" if it was \"holy\" with respect to the camp, or the holy city, it was \"most holy\" with respect to all without the camp, or without the gate.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the expression does not mean \"in the most holy place,\" but \"amongst the most holy things,\" as it does in Numbers 4:4, and above in verse 9. A distinction is clearly intended between the \"most holy things,\" which only the priests and their sons might eat, and the \"holy things,\" of which the rest of their families might partake also. It is difficult to decide between these renderings, although there can be no doubt that the \"most holy\" things were actually to be consumed within the tabernacle precincts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And this is thine. Here begins a second list of holy gifts which might be eaten at home by all members of the priestly families who were clean; they includedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) all wave offerings, especially the wave breast and heave shoulder of the peace offerings;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) all first-fruits of every kind;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) all that was devoted;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) all the first-born, or their substitutes. The first and third must have been very variable in amount, but the second and fourth, if honestly rendered, must have brought in a vast amount both of produce and of revenue. With all the wave offerings. Rather, \"in all the wave offerings,\" as in verse 8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - All the best. Literally, \"all the fat\" (cf. Genesis 45:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Everything devoted. כָּל־חֵרֶם. Septuagint, πᾶν ἀνατεθεματισμένον, all deodands, or things vowed (see on Leviticus 27:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - From a month old. Literally, \"from the monthly child,\" as soon as they reach the age of one month. According to thine estimation. See on Leviticus 5:15; 27:2-7. It would seem that the priest was to make the valuation for the people, since each first-born or firstling was separately claimed by God, and had to be separately redeemed; but at the same time, to prevent extortion, the sum which the priest might assess was fixed by God. For the money of five shekels. About seventeen shillings of our money (see Numbers 3:47). It is extremely drill cult to estimate the number of first-born, but it is evident that in any case a large income must have accrued to the priests in this way. No value is here set upon the firstlings of unclean beasts; in the most usual ease, that of the ass, the rule had been laid down in Exodus 13:13; and in other cases it was apparently left to the discretion of the priests, subject to the right of the owner, if he saw fit, to destroy the animal rather than pay for it (see Leviticus 27:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But the firstling of a cow, &c. Only those things which were not available for sacrifice could be redeemed; the rest must be offered to him that claimed them. The first-born of men belonged partially to both classes: on the one hand, they could not be sacrificed, and therefore were redeemed with money; on the other hand, they could be dedicated (being clean), and therefore had been exchanged for the Levites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. This is on the face of it inconsistent with the direction given in Deuteronomy 15:19, 20, that the flesh of the first-lings should be eaten by the offerers in the holy place (cf. also Deuteronomy 12:17, 18). Two explanations have been proposed.NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the firstlings were given to the priest in the same sense as the peace offerings, i.e., only as regarded the breast and shoulder, while the rest went to the offerer. This, however, does obvious violence to the language, and is not supported by the Septuagint.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That as the priest was bound to consume the firstlings with his family, and could not sell them, he would be certainly disposed to invite the offerer to join him in the sacred meal. This may have been usually the case, but it was entirely within the option of the priest, and could scarcely be made the basis of a direct command, like that of Deuteronomy 15:19, still less of an indirect assumption, like that of Deuteronomy 12:17, 18, that the firstlings stood upon the same footing as free-will offerings and heave offerings. It is easier to suppose that the law was actually modified in this, as in some other particulars.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - All the heave offerings of the holy things. Those, viz., enumerated from verse 9. It is a covenant of salt for ever. Septuagint, διαθήκη ἀλὸς αἰωνίου (cf. 2 Chronicles 13:5). Salt was the natural emblem of that which is incorruptible; wherefore a binding alliance was (and still is) made by eating bread and salt together, and salt was always added to the sacrifices of the Lord (Leviticus 2:13; Mark 9:49).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land. The priests had of necessity homes wherein to live when not on duty, but they had no territory of their own in the same sense as Jews of other tribes. I am thy part and thine inheritance. Septuagint, ἐγὼ μερίς σου καὶ κληρονομία σου. This is not to be explained away, as if it meant only that they were to live \"of the altar.\" Just as the priests (and in a lesser sense all the Levites) were the special possession of the Lord, so the Lord was the special possession of the priests; and inasmuch as all the whole earth belonged to him, the portion of the priests was, potentially in all cases, actually for those who were capable of realizing it, infinitely more desirable than any other portion. The spiritual meaning of the promise was so clearly felt that it was constantly claimed by the devout in Israel, irrespective of their ecclesiastical status (cf. Psalm 16:5; Lamentations 3:24, &c.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - All the tenth. The tithe of all fruits and flocks had been already claimed absolutely by the Lord (Leviticus 27:30, 32). It is probable indeed that the giving of tithes had been more or less a matter of obligation from time immemorial. Abraham had paid them on one memorable occasion (Genesis 14:20), and Jacob had vowed them on another (Genesis 28:22). From this time forth, however, the tithes were formally assigned to the maintenance of the Levites, in return for their service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Lest they bear sin, and die. לָשֵׂאת חֵטְא לָמוּת. Septuagint, λαβεῖν ἀμαρτίαν θανατηφόρον. In the sense of incurring sin, and the consequent wrath and death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And they shall bear (יִשְׂאוּ) their iniquity. The Levites were to take the responsibility of the general iniquity so far as approach to the tabernacle was concerned. They have no inheritance. Like the priests, they had homes and cities, and they had pasturages attached to these cities, but no separate territory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - As an heave offering. This means nothing more than an \"offering\" apparently. It is not to be supposed that any ritual was observed in the giving of tithes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And the Lord spake unto Moses. This part of the instruction alone is addressed to Moses, probably because it determined a question as between priests and Levites to the advantage of the former, and therefore would not have come well from Aaron.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe. Thus the principle of giving a tenth part of all to God was carried out consistently throughout the whole of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Ye shall give thereof the Lord's heave offering to Aaron the priest. The Levites tithed the people, the priests tithed the Levites. At this time the other Israelites were nearly fifty times as numerous as the Levites, and therefore they would have been exceptionally well provided for. It must be remembered, however, that the Levites would naturally increase faster than the rest, not being exposed to the same dangers; and still more that tithes are never paid at all fully or generally, even when of strict legal obligation. A glance along the history of Israel after the conquest will satisfy us that at no time could the people at large be trusted to pay their tithes, unless it were during the ascendancy of the Maccabees, and afterwards under the influence of the Pharisees (cf. Malachi 3:9, 10). The Levites, indeed, appear in the history of Israel as the reverse of an opulent or influential class. It was no doubt much easier for the sons of Aaron to obtain their tithes from the Levites; and as these were very numerous in proportion, and the tithes themselves were only a part of their revenues, the priests should have been, and in later times certainly were, sufficiently rich. If they were devout they no doubt spent much on the service of the altar and of the sanctuary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Thou shalt say unto them, i.e., to the Levites.

They would not incur any guilty responsibility by enjoying it as and where they pleased. Neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. This seems to be the tree translation, and it conveyed a final warning. See Leviticus 22:2 for one very obvious way in which the Levites might pollute \"holy things.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron. On the addition of the second name see on Numbers 18:1. There is no note of time in connection with this chapter, but internal evidence points strongly to the supposition that it belongs to the early days of wandering after the ban. It belongs to a period when death had resumed his normal, and more than his normal, power over the children of Israel; when, having been for a short time expelled (except in a limited number of cases - see above on Numbers 10:28), he had come back with frightful rigour to reign over a doomed generation. It belongs also, as it would seem, to a time when the daily, monthly, and even annual routine of sacrifice and purgation was suspended through poverty, distress, and disfavour with God. It tells of the mercy and condescension which did not leave even the rebellious and excommunicate without some simple remedy, some easily-obtainable solace, for the one religious distress which must of necessity press upon them daily and hourly, not only as Israelites, but as children of the East, sharing the ordinary superstitions of the age. Through the valley of the shadow of death they were doomed at Kadesh to walk, while their fellows fell beside them one by one, until the reek and taint of death passed upon the whole congregation. Almost all nations have had, as is well known, an instinctive horror of death, which has every. where demanded separation and purification on the part of those who have come in contact with it (Bahr, 'Symbolik,' 2, page 466 sq.). And this religious horror had not been combated, but, on the contrary, fostered and deepened by the Mosaic legislation. The law everywhere encouraged the idea that sin and death were essentially connected, and that disease and death spread their infection in the spiritual as well as in the natural order of things. Life and death were the two opposite poles under the law, as under the gospel; but the eye of faith was fixed upon natural life and natural death, and was not trained to look beyond. It could never have occurred to a Jew to say, \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.\" To die, however nobly, was not only to be cut off from God oneself, but to become a curse and a danger and a cause of religious defilement to those around. There is, therefore, a beautiful consistency between this enactment and the circumstances of the time on the one hand, between this enactment and the revealed character of God on the other hand. Although they were his covenant people no more, since they were under sentence of death, yet, like others, and more than others, they had religious horrors and religious fears - not very spiritual, perhaps, but very real to them; these horrors and fears cried to him piteously for relief, and that relief he was careful to give. They must die, but they need not suffer daily torment of death; they must not worship him in the splendid and perfect order of his appointed ritual, but they should at least have the rites which should make life tolerable to them. It appears to be a mistake to connect this ordinance especially with the plague which occurred after the rebellion of Korah. It was not an exceptional calamity, the effects of which might indeed be widespread, but would be soon over, which the people had to dread exceedingly; it was the daily mortality always going on in every camp under all circumstances. If only the elder generation died off in the wilderness, this alone would yield nearly 100 victims every day, and by each of these a considerable number of the survivors must have been defiled. Thus, in the absence of special provision, one of two things must have happened: either the unhappy people would have grown callous and indifferent to the awful presence of death; or, more probably, a dark cloud of religious horror and depression would have permanently enveloped them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This is the ordinance of the law. חֻקַּת הַתּורָה. Law-statute: an unusual combination only found elsewhere in Numbers 31:21, which also concerns legal purifications. A red heifer. This offering was obviously intended, apart from its symbolic significance, to be studiedly simple and cheap. In contradiction to the many and costly and ever-repeated sacrifices of the Sinaitic legislation, this was a single individual, a female, and of the most common description: red is the most ordinary colour of cattle, and a young heifer is of less value than any other beast of its kind. The ingenuity indeed of the Jews heaped around the choice of this animal a multitude of precise requirements, and supplemented the prescribed ritual with many ceremonies, some of which are incorporated by the Targums with the sacred text; but even so they could not destroy the remarkable contrast between the simplicity of this offering and the elaborate complexity of those ordained at Sinai. Only six red heifers are said to have been needed during the whole of Jewish history, so far-reaching and so long-enduring were the uses and advantages of a single immolation. It is evident that this ordinance had for its distinguishing character oneness as opposed to multiplicity, simplicity contrasted with elaborateness. Without spot, wherein is no blemish. See on Leviticus 4:8. However little, comparatively speaking, the victim might cost them, it must yet be perfect of its kind. The later Jews held that three white hairs together on any part of the body made it unfit for the purpose. On the sex and color of the offering see below. Upon which never came yoke. Cf. Deuteronomy 21:3; 1 Samuel 6:7. The imposition of the yoke, according to the common sentiment of all nations, was a species of degradation, and therefore inconsistent with the ideal of what was fit to be offered in rids ease. That the matter was wholly one of sentiment is nothing to the point: God doth not care for oxen of any kind, but he doth care that man should give him what is, whether in fact or in fancy, the best of its sort.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Unto Eleazar the priest. Possibly in order that Aaron himself might not be associated with dearly, even in this indirect way (see verse 6). In after times, however, it was usually the high priest who officiated on this occasion, and therefore it is quite as likely that Eleazar was designated because he was already beginning to take the place of his father in his especial duties. Without the camp. The bodies of those animals which were offered for the sin of the congregation were always burnt outside the camp, the law thus testifying that sin and death had no proper place within the city of God. In this case, however, the whole sacrifice was performed outside the camp, and was only brought into relation with the national sanctuary by the sprinkling of the blood in that direction. Various symbolic reasons have been assigned to this fact, but none are satisfactory except the following: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. It served to intensify the conviction, which the whole of this ordinance was intended to bring home to the minds of men, that death was an awful thing, and that everything connected with it was wholly foreign to the presence and habitation of the living God.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It served to mark with more emphasis the contrast between this one offering, which was perhaps almost the only one they had in the wilderness, and those which ought to have been offered continually according to the Levitical ordinances. The red heifer stood quite outside the number of ordinary victims as demanded by the law, and therefore it was not slain at any hallowed altar, nor, necessarily, by any hallowed hand.NEWLINENEWLINE3. It served to prefigure in a wonderful and indeed startling way the sacrifice of Christ outside the gate. In later days the heifer was conducted upon a double tier of arches over the ravine of Kedron to the opposite slope of Olivet. That he may bring her forth... and one shall slay her. The nominative to both these verbs is alike unexpressed. Septuagint, καὶ ἐξάξουσιν . . καὶ σφάξουσιν. In the practice of later ages the high priest led her out, and another priest killed her in his presence, but it was not so commanded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. And Eleazar... shall... sprinkle of her blood directly before (אֵל־נֹכַח פְּנֵי) the tabernacle. By this act the death of the heifer became a sacrificial offering. The sprinkling in the direction of the sanctuary intimated that the offering was made to him that dwelt therein, and the \"seven times\" was the ordinary number of perfect performance (Leviticus 4:17, &c.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - One shall burn the heifer. See on Exodus 29:14. And her blood. In all other cases the blood was poured away beside the altar, because in the blood was the life, and the life was given to God in exchange for the life of the offerer. This great truth, which underlay all animal sacrifices, was represented in this case by the sprinkling towards the sanctuary. The rest of the blood was burnt with the carcass, either because outside the holy precincts there was no consecrated earth to receive the blood, or in order that the virtue of the blood might in a figure pass into the ashes and add to their efficacy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. See on Leviticus 14:4-6 for the significance of these things. The antiseptic and medicinal qualities of the cedar (Juniperus oxycedrus) and hyssop (probably Capparis spinosa) make their use readily intelligible; the symbolism of the \"scarlet\" is much more obscure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The priest shall be unclean until the even, i.e., the priest who superintended the sacrifice, and dipped his finger in the blood. Every one of these details was devised in order to express the intensely infectious character of death in its moral aspect. The very ashes, which were so widely potent for cleansing (verse 10), and the cleansing water itself (verse 19), made every one that touched them, even for the purifying of another, himself unclean. At the same time the ashes, while, as it were, so redolent of death that they must be kept outside the camp, were most holy, and were to be laid up by a clean man in a clean place (verse 9). These contradictions find their true explanation only when we consider them as foreshadowing the mysteries of the atonement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For a water of separation, i.e., a water which should remedy the state of legal separation due to the defilement of death, just as in chapter 8 the water of purification from sin is called the water of sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - It shall be unto the children of Israel... a statute for ever. This may refer only to the former part of the verse, according to the analogy of verse 21, or it may refer to the whole ordinance of the red heifer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall be unclean seven days. The fact of defilement by contact with the dead had been mentioned before (Leviticus 21:1; Numbers 5:2; Numbers 6:6; Numbers 9:6), and had no doubt been recognized as a religious pollution from ancient times; but the exact period of consequent uncleanness is here definitely fixed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - With it. בּו i.e., as the sense clearly demands, with the water of separation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Defileth the tabernacle of the Lord. On the bearing of this remarkable announcement see Leviticus 15:31. The uncleanness of death was not simply a personal matter, it involved, if not duly purged, the whole congregation, and reached even to God himself, for its defilement spread to the sanctuary. Cut off from Israel, i.e., excommunicate on earth, and liable to the direct visitation of Heaven (cf. Genesis 17:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This is the law. הַתּורָה. By this law the extent of the infection is rigidly defined, as its duration by the last. In a tent. This fixes the date of the law as given in the wilderness, but it leaves in some uncertainty the rule as to settled habitations. The Septuagint, however, has here ἐν οἰκίᾳ, and therefore it would appear that the law was transferred without modification from the tent to the house. In the case of large houses with many inhabitants, some relaxation of the strictness must have been found necessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Which hath no covering bound upon it. So the Septuagint (ὅσα οὐχὶ δεσμὸν καταδέδεται ἐπ αὐτῷ), and this is the sense. In the Hebrew פָּתִיל, a string, stands in apposition to צָּמִיד, a covering. If the vessel was open, its contents were polluted by the odour of death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - One that is slain with a sword. This would apply especially, it would seem, to the field of battle; but the law must certainly have been relaxed in the case of soldiers. Or a bone of a man, or a grave. Thus the defilement was extended to the mouldering remains of humanity, and even to the tombs (μνήματα. Cf. Luke 11:44) which held them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Running water. Septuagint, ὕδωρ ζῶν (cf. Leviticus 14:5; John 4:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Shall take hyssop. See Exodus 12:22, and cf. Psalm 51:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - On the third day, and on the seventh day. The twice-repeated application of holy water marked the clinging nature of the pollution to be removed; so also the repetition of the threat in the following verse marked the heinousness of the neglect to seek its removal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - It shall be a perpetual statute. This formula usually emphasizes something of solemn importance. In this case, as apparently above in verse 10, the regulations thus enforced might seem of trifling moment. But the whole design of this ordinance, down to its minutest detail, was to stamp upon physical death a far-reaching power of defiling and separating from God, which extended even to the very means Divinely appointed as a remedy. The Jew, whose religious feelings were modeled upon this law, must have felt himself entangled in the meshes of a net so widely cast about him that he could hardly quite escape it by extreme caution and multiplied observances; he might indeed exclaim, unless habit hardened him to it, \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the tabernacle of the congregation - where the Lord spake with Moses \"face to face\" (Exodus 33:11), and where all the laws of Leviticus had been given (Leviticus 1:1).

The census here ordered had clearly been anticipated, as far as the numbers were concerned, by the results of the half-shekel poll-tax for the service of the sanctuary levied some time before on all adult males on pain of Divine displeasure (Exodus 30:11, sq.). Since all who were liable had paid that tax (Exodus 38:25, 26), it would only have been requisite to make slight; corrections for death or coming of age during the interval. The totals, however, in the two cases being exactly the same, it is evident that no such corrections were made, and that the round numbers already obtained were accepted as sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes. After their families. This was to be a registration as well as a census. No doubt the lists and pedigrees collected at this time laid the foundation of that exact and careful genealogical lore which played so important a part both in the religious and in the secular history of the Jews down to the final dispersion. Every Jew had not only his national, but also (and often even more) his tribal and family, associations, traditions, and sympathies. Unity, but not uniformity, - unity in all deepest interests and highest purposes, combined with great variety of character, of tradition, and even of tendency, - was the ideal of the life of Israel. The number of their names. It is impossible to help thinking of the parallel expression in Acts 1:15, of the similarity in position of the two peoples, of the contrast between their numbers and apparent chances of success, of the more striking contrast between their actual achievements.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - By their armies.

If they were simply the poll-tax figures unaltered, it would be natural to suppose that the offerings were made up in fifty-shekel lots, and the offerers divided as nearly as possible into hundreds.

The enormous numerical increase in this tribe is the more remarkable because it is clearly intimated that Dan had but one son, Hushim or Shuham (Genesis 46:23; Numbers 26:42). It may, of course, be said that he had other sons not enumerated, but such an assumption is arbitrary and improbable in the face of the family genealogies in chapter 26. If he had any other sons, they did not leave any families behind them. But if the sojourning of the Israelites in Egypt was 430 years, according to the plain statement of Exodus 12:40, even this increase is quite within possible, and even probable, limits, considering the peculiar circumstances and the known fecundity of the race. For if Hushim, who came into Egypt with his grandfather, had only three sons born to him within the next twenty-five years, and if his descendants doubled themselves every quarter of a century, which is not an uncommon rate of increase under certain circumstances, then his numbers would have fully reached 200,000 by the time of the exodus. Perhaps the most puzzling feature about the increase is the great inequality with which it was spread over the various tribes, a fact of which we cannot even suggest any explanation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThose that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the children of Asher, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThose that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThose that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - Six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. See Exodus 38:26. As the adult male Levites numbered about 10,000, this represents an increase of 13,000 since the exodus. Some thousands had died through the Divine displeasure, but, on the other hand, the natural mortality may have ceased. It was evidently in the purpose of God that all who crossed the Red Sea should also enter their promised land.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 1:47-54 THE LEVITES (verses 47-54).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - Not numbered among them.

Rather, \"spake,\" and so Septuagint. This was the formal command to separate, although it had been anticipated to a considerable extent. The Levites had been marked out from the othersNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as the tribesmen of Moses and Aaron,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) as the champions of Jehovah in the matter of the golden calf (Exodus 32:26, sq.); they had been already employed, or at least designated, for religious services; and the peculiarity of their future position in Israel had been recognized in the Divine legislation (Leviticus 25:32, sq.), and in their not being called upon to contribute to the capitation for the sanctuary. In a word, this ordinance, like so many others, did little more than give a formal and direct sanction to a state of things which had already come into play, partly through natural causes, partly through providential directions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - The stranger. The word appears to mean here any unauthorized person (see Numbers 16:40). This is the first intimation given of the extreme and awful sanctity of the tabernacle, as the tent of the Divine Presence. It is, however, quite of a piece with the anxious warnings against intrusion upon the holy mount at the time of the giving of the law (Exodus 19:21, sq.). The great necessity for Israel was that he should understand and believe that the Lord before whom he had trembled at Sinai was really in the midst of him in all his travail and his danger. This could only be impressed upon his dull mind and hard heart by surrounding the presence chamber of Jehovah with awful sanctities and terrors. At a subsequent period, when the religious reverence here thrown around the tabernacle had been transferred to, or rather concentrated upon, the ark alone, Uzzah was actually smitten for breaking this law (1 Chronicles 13:10). The tumult raised against St. Paul (Acts 21:27, sq.) was justified by a supposed violation of the same.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - That there be no wrath upon the congregation - that no man, not being a Levite, intrude himself through ignorance or presumption upon the sacredness of the tabernacle, and so bring death upon himself, and displeasure upon the people. The Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle. Out of this command grew the Levitical guard of the temple, which afterwards played a considerable part in the history of Israel (2 Kings 11).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers1:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.VERSEENDNEWLINETHE LAST MARCH: FROM KADESH TO HOR (verses 1-29). Verse 1. - Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation. The latter words are emphatic here and in verse 22, and seem intended to mark the period of reassembly after the dispersion of nearly thirty eight years. Probably a portion of the tribes had visited Kadesh many times during those years, and perhaps it had never been wholly abandoned. Into the desert of Zin, i.e., if the western site be maintained for Kadesh, the Wady Murreh. See the note on Kadesh. In the first month. In the month Abib (Nisan), the vernal month, when there was \"much grass\" (cf. John 6:10) in places at other seasons desert, and when traveling was most easy. From comparison of Numbers 14:33; Numbers 33:38 and the sequence of the narrative, it appears to have, been the first month of the fortieth, and last year of wandering, Then it was that they reassembled in the same neighbourhood from whence they had dispersed so long before (see the note before chapter 15). And the people abode (יֵשֵׁב Septuagint, κατέμεινεν) in Kadesh. From the date given in Numbers 33:38 it would seem that they remained three or four months in Kadesh on this occasion. This delay may have been occasioned partly by the ingraining for Miriam (cf. verse 29), and partly by the necessity of awaiting answers from Edom and from Moab (see on verse 14). And Miriam died there, and was buried. Nothing could be more brief and formal than this mention of the death of one who had played a considerable part in Israel, and had perhaps wished to play a more considerable part. It can scarcely, however, be doubted that her death in the unlovely wilderness was a punishment like the death of her brothers. There is no reason whatever to suppose that she had any part in the rebellion of Kadesh, or that the sentence of death there pronounced included her; she was indeed at this time advanced in years, rut that would not in itself account for the fact that she died in exile; it is, no doubt, to the arrogance and rebellion recorded in chapter 12 that we must look for the true explanation of her untimely end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - There was no water. There was a large natural spring at Kadesh, and during the time of their previous sojourn there no complaint of this sort seems to have arisen. At this time, however, the bulk of the encampment may have lain in a different direction (cf. verse 1 with chapter Numbers 13:26), or the supply may have failed kern temporary causes. In either case a total absence of water need not be imagined, but only an insufficient supply.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the people abode with Moses. As their fathers had done in similar circumstances, as recorded in Exodus 17. Would God that we had died. See on Numbers 14:2. When our brethren died before the Lord. This is difficult, because the visitations of God at Kibroth-hattaavah (Numbers 11:34) and at Kadesh (Numbers 14:37) had overtaken not their brethren, but their fathers, some thirty-eight years before. On the other hand, the daily mortality which had carried off their brethren is clearly excluded by the phrase, \"before the Lord.\" It may he that the rebellion of Korah happened towards the end of the period of wandering, and that the reference is to the plague which followed it; or it may be that the formula of complaint had become stereotyped, as those of children often do, and was employed from time to time without variation and without definite reference. The latter supposition is strongly supported by the character of the words which follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness? These words are almost exactly repeated from Exodus 17:3. They, and those which follow, are no doubt out of place if considered as expressing the feelings of the great bulk of the people, who had no knowledge of Egypt, and had grown up in the wilderness. But on such occasions it is always the few who put words into the months of the many, and the ringleaders in this gainsaying would naturally be the survivors of the elder generation, whose dis. position was exactly the same as ever, and who had always shown a remarkable want of originality in their complaints.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - No place of seed. Septuagint, τόπος οῦ οὐ σπείρεται. A place where there is no sowing, and therefore no harvest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They fell upon their faces. See note on chapter Numbers 14:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Take the rod. The ῤάβδος, or staff of office, with which Moses and Aaron had worked wonders before Pharaoh (Exodus 7:9 sq.), and with which Moses had smitten the rock in Rephidim (Exodus 17:6). This rod had not been mentioned, nor perhaps used, since then; but we might certainly have supposed that the instrument of so many miracles would be reverently laid up in the tabernacle \"before the Lord,\" and, this we find from the next verse to have been the case. Gather thou the assembly together, i.e., by their representatives. Speak ye unto the rock before their eyes. The word used for the rock in this narrative is הַסֶּלַע instead of הַצּוּר, as in Exodus 17. It does not seem that any certain distinction of meaning can be drawn between the words, which are obviously interchanged in Judges 6:20, 21, and are both translated πέτρα by the Septuagint; but the careful use of different terms in the two narratives serves to distinguish them, just as the use of κοφίνους and σπυρίδας by St. Mark (Mark 6:43; Mark 8:8, 19, 20) helps to distinguish the two miracles of feeding the multitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hear now, ye rebels. הַמֹּרִים. Septuagint, οἱ ἀπειθεῖς. The verb is used in a similar sense of Moses and Aaron themselves in verse 24. It has been suggested that this was the word really used by our Lord in Matthew 5:22, and translated μωρός. This, however, is extremely precarious, and is indeed to accuse the Evangelist of a blunder, for there is no real correspondence between the words. Must we fetch you water. Septuagint, μὴ ἐξάξομεν ὑμῖν ὕδωρ. And this is no doubt the sense. It has been rendered by some \"Can we fetch you water,\" on the supposition that Moses really doubted the possibility of such a miracle, but this seems to be an entire mistake (see next note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel. It is very important, and at the same time very difficult, to understand what the precise sin of Moses and Aaron was upon this occasion. That it was very serious is manifest from the punishment which is entailed. Aaron, indeed, does not appear in the narrative, save in his usual subordinate position as associated with his brother by the Divine mandate. It has been said that he might have checked the unadvised words of Moses, but that is wholly beside the mark. Aaron had obviously no control whatever over his far more able and energetic brother, and therefore could have no responsibility in that respect. We can only suppose that he inwardly assented to the language and conduct with which he was outwardly associated, and therefore shared the guilt. A less degree of sin was (so to speak) necessary in his cause, because he had on former occasions so greatly dishonoured his office; and the anger of God against the sin of his ministers, although laid to sleep, is ever ready to awake upon the recurrence of a similar provocation. We may therefore dismiss him, and consider only the case of Moses. It is impossible to suppose that Moses actually doubted the power of God to supply the present need, for he held in his hand the very rod with which he had struck the rock in Rephidim, nor is there anything in his words or acts upon this occasion to imply any such disbelief. The language of Numbers 11:21, 22 may be cited on the other side, but that was spoken in passion, and spoken to God, and cannot be held as expressing an actual failure of faith. Nor do subsequent references point to unbelief as having been the sin of Moses (cf. Numbers 27:14; Deuteronomy 32:51; Psalm 106:33). Rather, they point to disobedience and indiscretion; to such disloyal conduct and language as produced a bad impression upon the people, and did not place the Divine character before them in its true light. We must understand, therefore, that the want of belief with which Moses stood charged was not a want of faith in the power of God, but a want of obedience to the will of God, bearing in mind that the two faults of disbelief and disobedience are but two sides of one inward fact, and are perpetually confounded in the language of Scripture (compare the use of ἀπειθεῖν in the New Testament). What then was the disobedience of Moses? Here, again, the more obvious answer is insufficient. It is true that Moses struck the rock twice instead of (or perhaps in addition to) speaking to it; but God had bid him take the rod, and he might naturally think he was meant to use it as before; moreover, the people could not have known anything of the exact terms of the command, and would have thought no more of his striking the rock at Kadesh than at Rephidim; but it was the fact of the bad impression made upon the people which was the ground of the Divine rebuke. We come back, therefore, to the simple conclusion expressed by the Psalmist (Psalm 106:32, 33), that Moses lost his temper, and in the irritation of the moment spoke and acted in such a way and in such a spirit as to dishonour his Master and to impair the good effect of the Divine beneficence. It is quite likely that the repeated striking of the rock was one sign of the anger to which Moses gave way, but we could hardly have attached any serious character to the act if it had stood alone. It is in the words of Moses, words in which he associated Aaron with himself, that we must find the explanation of the displeasure he incurred. That he called the people \"rebels\" was unseemly, not because it was untrue, or because it was an uncalled-for term of reproach, but because he himself was at that very moment a rebel, and disloyal in heart to his Master (cf. verse 24). That he should say, \"Must we fetch you water out of this rock?\" showed how completely he was carried away. It is true that God had said to him, \"Thou shalt bring forth to them water,\" and, \"Thou shalt give the congregation... drink\" (compare this with Exodus 17:6), and it is probable that his own words were more or less consciously dictated by this remembrance; but he knew very well that the Divine mandate afforded him no real justification; that he and Aaron were the merest instruments in the hand of God; that it was peculiarly necessary to keep this fact before the minds of the people; nevertheless, his vexation and anger betrayed him into putting himself - a mere man, and a man too in a very bad temper - into the place of God before the eyes of the whole congregation. Moses had fallen at least once before (see on Numbers 11:11-15) into a similar error, one so natural to an angry mind; but this was the first time that he had made his error public, and thereby dishonoured the Master whom it was his special duty to uphold and glorify. This was the sin, and if the punishment seem disproportionate, it must be remembered that the heinousness of a sin depends quite as much on the position of the sinner as upon its intrinsic enormity. Ye shall not bring this congregation into the land. That they should die in the wilderness was implied in this sentence, but was not strictly a part of the sentence itself. Moses, indeed, although he did not enter the land of promise in its narrower sense, yet he died within the inheritance of Israel. Since they had behaved unworthily of their high office as leaders of the people, therefore that office should be taken from them before the glorious end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This is the water of Meribah, or \"water of strife.\" Septuagint, ὕδωρ ἀντιλογίας. The word \"Meribah\" appears, however, to form part of a proper name in Deuteronomy 32:51. A similar use of the word is recorded in Exodus 17:7. That the same name was more or less definitely attached to these two scenes is only another way of saying that there was a strong similarity between the two sets of associations. At the same time the differences are so marked in the narratives that they leave very distinct impressions upon the mind. And he was sanctified in them, i.e., he revealed there his holiness and power, and put to silence their evil murmurings against him. He was sanctified in them all the more abundantly because Moses and Aaron failed to sanctify him in the eyes of the people; but what they failed to do he brought to pass without their agency.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom. On the kings of Edom see on Genesis 36:31. It would seem probable from Exodus 15:15 that the government was at that time (forty years before the present date) still in the hands of \"dukes,\" and that the change had but recently taken place. It is stated in Judges 11:17 that Moses sent messengers at this time with a like request to the king of Moab. We are not indeed obliged to suppose that Jephthah, living 300 years after, stated the facts correctly; but there is no particular reason to doubt it in this case. That no mention of it is made here would be sufficiently explained by the fact that the refusal of Edom made the answer of Moab of no practical moment. That Moses asked a passage through the territory of Edom implies that he had renounced the idea of invading Canaan from the south. This was not on account of any insuperable difficulties presented by the character of the country or of its inhabitants, for such did not exist; nor on account of any supposed presence of Egyptian troops in the south of Palestine: but simply on account of the fact that Israel had deliberately refused to take the straight road into their land, and were therefore condemned to follow a long and circuitous route ere they reached it on an altogether different side. The dangers and difficulties of the road they actually traversed were, humanly speaking, far greater than any they would have encountered in any other direction; but this was part of their necessary discipline. Thy brother Israel. This phrase recalled the history of Esau and Jacob, and of the brotherly kindness which the former had shown to the latter at a time when he had him in his power (Genesis 33). Thou knowest all the travel that hath befallen us. Moses assumed that Edom would take a fraternal interest in the fortunes of Israel. The parallel was singularly close between the position of Jacob when he met with Esau, and the present position of Israel; we may well suppose that Moses intended to make this felt without directly asserting it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And sent an angel. It is probable, that Moses purposely used an expression which might be understood in various senses, because he could not explain to the king of Edom the true relation of the Lord to his people. At the same time it was in the deepest sense true (cf. Exodus 14:19; Exodus 32:34), because it was the uncreated angel of the covenant, which was from God, and yet was God (cf. Genesis 32:30; Joshua 5:15; Joshua 6:2; Acts 7:35), who was the real captain of the Lord's host. In Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border. See note on Kadesh. It is clear that Kadesh itself was outside the territory of the king of Edom, although it lay close to the frontier.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country. Moses desired to march through Seir eastwards and northeastwards, so as to reach the country beyond Jordan. If the northern portion of the wilderness of Paran was at this time held by the king of Edom, it would be through this region that Israel would first seek to make their way from Kadesh to the Arabah; thence the broad and easy pass of the Wady Ghuweir would lead them through Mount Seir (properly so called) to the plains of Moab. Through the fields, or through the vineyards. These words attest the change for the worse in the condition of these regions. Even in the Wady Ghuweir, although springs and pasturage are abundant, fields and vineyards hardly exist.

By the highway. בַּמְסִלָּה. The Septuagint translates παρὰ τὸ ὄρος, but no doubt the word means a \"high road\" in the original sense of a raised causeway (cf. Isaiah 57:14). Such a road is still called Derb es Sultan - Emperor-road. I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet. Rather, \"It is nothing;\" (רַק אֵין־דָּבָר. Septuagint, ἀλλὰ τὸ πρᾶγμα οὐδέν ἐστι) \"I will go through on my feet.\" They meant, \"We do not ask for anything of value, only leave to pass through.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Thou shalt not go through.

If the narrative follows the order of time, we must suppose that the Edomites at once blocked the passes near to Kadesh, and thus compelled the Israelites to journey southwards for some distance until they were clear of the Azazimat; they would then turn eastwards again and make their way across the plateau of Paran to the Arabah at a point opposite Mount Hen It is supposed by many, although it finds no support in the narrative itself, that the armed resistance offered by Edom is out of chronological order in verse 20, and only occurred in fact when the Israelites had reached the neighbourhood of Mount Her, and were preparing to ascend the Wady Ghuweir. On the name of Mount Her (הֹר הָהָר) see on Numbers 34:7, 8. There can be no doubt that tradition is right in identifying it with the Jebel Harun (mount of Aaron), a lofty and precipitous mountain rising between the Arabah and the site of Petra. On one of its two summits the tomb of Aaron is still shown, and although this is itself worthless as evidence, yet the character and position of the mountain are altogether in agreement with the legend.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - By the coast of the land of Edom. Mount Her was on the eastern side of the Arabah, which at this point certainly formed the frontier of Edom; but it was no doubt untenanted, owing to its bare and precipitous character, and therefore was not reckoned as the property of Edom. We may suppose that at this time the encampment stretched along the Arabah in front of the mountain (see on Numbers 33:30; Deuteronomy 10:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Aaron shall be gathered unto his people.

It can scarcely be doubted that the object of this command was to produce a deeper effect upon the people. The whole multitude would be able to see the high priest, whose form had been so familiar to them as long as they could remember anything, slowly ascending the bare sides of the mountain; and they knew that he went up to die. The whole multitude would be able to see another and a younger man descending by the same path in the same priestly robes, and they knew that Aaron was dead, and that Eleazar was high priest in his room. Death is often most striking when least expected, but there are occasions (and this was one) when it gains in effect by being invested in a certain simple ceremonial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son. This was done in token that the office was transferred; it was done out of sight, and far above, in token that the priesthood was perpetual, although the priest was mortal. Aaron died there. In this case, as in that of Miriam (verse 1), and of Moses himself (Deuteronomy 34:5), no details are given. God drew as it were a veil over a departure hence which could but be very sad, because it was in a special sense the wages of sin. We may perhaps conclude that Aaron died alone, and was buried, as Moses was, by God; otherwise Moses and Eleazar would have been unclean under the law of Numbers 19:11 (cf. also Leviticus 21:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - They mourned for Aaron thirty days. The Egyptians prolonged their mourning for seventy days (Genesis 1:3), but thirty days seems to have been the longest period allowed among the Israelites (cf. Deuteronomy 34:8).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell. Rather, \"And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the Negeb, heard tell.\" It is possible that Arad was the name of the king (it occurs as the name of a man, 1 Chronicles 8:15), but it was almost certainly the name of his place. The \"king of Arad, is mentioned in Joshua 12:14, and \"the Negeb of Arad\" in Judges 1:16. From the context of these passages it is evident that it was situated in the southernmost district of what was afterwards the territory of Judah. According to Eusebius, it stood twenty Roman miles to the south of Hebron, and its site has been found by modern travelers at Tel-Arad, a low hill in this direction. On the Negeb see note on Numbers 13:17. By the way of the spies. דֶּרֶך הָאַתָרִים. Septuagint, ὀδὸν Αθαρείν. The translation is very uncertain; atharim may be a proper name, as the Septuagint seems to suppose, or it may be an unusual plural formed from תוּר, equivalent to הַתָּרִים, \"spies,\" as the Chaldee, Samaritan, and most of the versions take it; or it may be simply the plural from אַתַר, a place, used with some local meaning which made it practically a proper name. If the rendering of the A.V. be correct, \"the way of the spies\" must have been the route by which they ascended to Hebron through the Negeb (Numbers 13:17, 22), and the king of Arid must have anticipated an invasion in that direction, and sought to forestall it. And took some of them prisoners. This would seem to show that he fell upon them unawares, and cut off some detached parties. Nothing is said of any disobedience on the part of Israel to account for defeat in battle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Israel vowed a vow. On these vows, and on things \"devoted\" or \"banned\" (חֵרֶם - ἀνάθεμα), see on Leviticus 27:28, and on the moral character of such wholesale slaughters see on chapter 31. If it was right to destroy the Canaanites at all, no fault can be found with the vow; it merely did for that military proceeding what national feeling and discipline does for the far more bloody exigencies of modern warfare, removing it from the sphere of private hatred, revenge, and cupidity, and placing it upon a higher level. The patriot soldier of these days feels himself to be a mere instrument in the hands of the rulers of his people to maintain their rights or avenge their wrongs. The Israelite could not have this feeling, which was foreign to his time and place in history, but he could feel that he was a mere instrument in the hands of God to perform his will upon his enemies. In either case a must important advantage is secured; the soldier does not slay in order to gratify his own hatred, or in order to satisfy his own cupidity. It is quite true that such vows as are here mentioned would certainly in a more advanced stage of civilization be abused to throw a cloak of religion over frightful enormities; but it does not in the least follow that they were not permitted and even encouraged by God in an age to which they were natural, and under circumstances in which they were beneficial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They utterly destroyed them and their cities. Rather, \"they banned (יַּחַרֵם - ἀναθεμάτισεν) them and their cities.\" No doubt the banning implies here their utter destruction, because it is not the vow before the battle, but the carrying of it out after the victory, which is here spoken cf. And he called the name of the place Hormah. Rather, \"the name of the place was called (impersonal use of the transitive) Charmah.\" חָרְמָה. Septuagint, Ἀνάθεμα. It is not very clear what place received this name at this time. It does not appear to have been Arid itself, as would have seemed most natural, because Arid and Hormah are mentioned side by side in Joshua 12:14. It is identified with Zephath in Judges 1:17. It may have been the place where the victory was won which gave all the cities of Arid to destruction. Whether it was the Hormah mentioned in chapter Numbers 14:45 is very doubtful (see note there). The nomenclature of the Jews, especially as to places, and most especially as to places with which their own connection was passing or broken, was vague and confused in the extreme, and nothing can be more unsatisfactory than arguments which turn upon the shifting names of places long ago perished and forgotten. It must be added that the three verses which narrate the chastisement of this Canaanite chieftain have caused immense embarrassment to commentators. If the incident is narrated in its proper order of time, it must have happened during the stay of the Israelites under Mount Hor, when they had finally left the neighbourhood of the Negeb, and were separated from the king of Arid by many days' march, and by a most impracticable country. It is therefore generally supposed that the narrative is out of place, and that it really belongs to the time when Israel was gathered together for the second time at Kadesh, and When his reappearance there in force might well have given rise to the report that be was about to invade Canaan from that side. This is unsatisfactory, because no plausible reason can be assigned for the insertion of the notice where it stands, both here and in Numbers 33:40. To say that Moses wished to bring it into juxtaposition with the victories recorded in the latter part of the chapter, from which it is separated by the incident of the fiery serpents, and the brief record of many journeys, is to confess that no explanation can be invented which has the least show of reason. If the narrative be displaced, the displacement must simply be due to accident or interpolation. Again, it would seem quite inconsistent with the position and plans of Israel since the rebellion of Kadesh that any invasion and conquest, even temporary, of any part of Canaan should be made at this time, and that especially if the attack was not made until Israel was lying in the Arabah on his way round the land of Edom. It is therefore supposed by some that the vow only was made at this time, and the ban suspended over the place, and that it was only carried out as part of the general conquest under Joshua; that, in fact, the fulfillment of the vow is narrated in Joshua 12:14; Judges 1:16, 17. This, however, throws the narrative as it stands into confusion and discredit, for the ban and the destruction become a mockery and an unreality if nothing more was done to the towns of the king of Arad than was done at the same time to the towns of all his neighbours. It would be more reverent to reject the story as an error or a falsehood than to empty it of the meaning which it was obviously intended to convey. We are certainly meant to understand that the vow was there and then accepted by God, and was there and then carried into effect by Israel; the towns of Arad were depopulated and destroyed as far as lay in their power, although they may have been immediately reoccupied. There are only two theories which are worth considering. 1. The narrative may really be displaced, for what cause we do not know. If so, it would he more satisfactory to refer it, not to the time of the second encampment at Kadesh, but to the time of the first, during the absence of the spies in Canaan. It is probable that their entry was known, as was the case with Joshua's spies (Joshua 2:2); and nothing could be more likely than that the king of Arad, suspecting what would follow, should attempt to anticipate invasion by attack. If it were so it might help to account for the rash confidence shown by the people afterwards (Numbers 14:40), for the mention of Hormah (Numbers 14:45), and for the reappearance of kings of Hormah and of Arad in the days of Joshua 2. The narrative may after all be in place. That the Israelites lay for thirty days under Mount Hor is certain, and they may have been longer. During this period they could not get pasture for their cattle on the side of Edom, and they may have wandered far and wide in search of it. It may have been but a comparatively small band which approached the Negeb near enough to be attacked, and which, by the help of God, was enabled to defeat the king of Arad, and to lay waste his towns. It had certainly been no great feat for all Israel to overthrow a border chieftain who could not possibly have brought 5000 men into the field.

It appears from comparison of Numbers 33:38 and Numbers 20:29 that their departure was not earlier than the beginning of the sixth month of the fortieth year. This season would be one of the hottest and most trying for marching. By the way of the Red Sea, i.e., down the Arabah, towards Ezion-geber, at the head of the Elanitic Gulf. Septuagint, ὁδὸν ἐπὶ θά. Not far from this place they would reach the end of the Edomitish territory, and turn eastwards and northwards up the Wady el Ithm towards the steppes of Moab. Discouraged. Literally, \"shortened\" or \"straitened,\" as in Exodus 6:9. Septuagint, ὡλιγοψύχησεν ὁ λαός. Because of the way. The Ambah is a stony, sandy, almost barren plain shut in by mountain walls on either side, and subject to sand-storms. It was not only, however, merely the heat and drought and ruggedness of the route which depressed them, but the fact that they were marching directly away from Canaan, and knew not how they were ever to reach it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - There is no bread, neither is there any water. The one of these statements was no doubt as much and as little true as the other. There was no ordinary supply of either; but as they had bread given to them from heaven, so they had water from the rock, otherwise they could not possibly have existed. Our soul loatheth this light bread. קְלקֵל, a stronger form than קַל from קָלַל. Septuagint, διακένῳ. They meant to say, as their fathers had (chapter 11:6), that it was unsavory and unsubstantial in comparison with the heavy and succulent diet of Egypt (see note on chapter Numbers 20:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Fiery serpents, גְחָשִׁים שְׂרָפִים. Nachash is the ordinary word for serpent. The word saraph which seems to mean \"burning one,\" stands (by itself) for a serpent in verse 8, and also in Isaiah 14:29; Isaiah 30:6. In Isaiah 6:2, 6 it stands for one of the symbolic beings (seraphim) of the prophet's vision. The only idea common to the two meanings (otherwise so distinct) must be that of brilliance and metallic luster. It is commonly assumed that the \"fiery\" serpents were so called because of the burning pain and inflammation caused by the bite, after the analogy of the πρηστῆρες and καύσωνες of Dioscorus and AElian. But is hardly possible that Isaiah should have used the same word in such wholly dissimilar senses, and it is clear from comparison with Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim (Ezekiel 1:7) that the saraph of Isaiah 6:2 was so called from the burnished luster of his appearance. Even our Lord himself is described in the Apocalypse as having in the highest degree this appearance of glowing brass (Revelation 1:15; Revelation 2:18). It is further clear that the saraph was so named from his colour, not his venom, because when Moses was ordered to make a saraph he made a serpent of brass (or rather copper), with the evident intent of imitating as closely as possible the appearance of the venomous reptile. We may conclude then with some confidence that these serpents were of a fiery red colour, resembling in this respect certain very deadly snakes in Australia, which are known as \"copper snakes.\" Travelers speak of some such pests as still abounding in the region of the Arabah, but it is quite uncertain whether the fiery serpents of that special visitation can be identified with any existing species.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Pray unto the Lord. This is the first and only (recorded) occasion on which the people directly asked for the intercession of Moses (cf., however, chapter Numbers 11:2), although Pharaoh had done so several times, and never in vain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Make thee a fiery serpent. A saraph. The Septuagint, not understanding the meaning of saraph, has simply ὄφιν (cf. John 3:14). Set it upon a pole. גֵם Septuagint σήμειον. Vulgate, signum. The same word is better translated \"ensign\" in such passages as Isaiah 11:10; \"banner\" in such as Psalm 60:4; \"standard\" in such as Jeremiah 51:27. The \"pole\" may have been the tallest and most conspicuous of those military standards which were planted (probably on some elevation) as rallying points for the various camps; or it may have been one loftier still, made for the occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When he beheld the serpent (גָחָשׁ in all three places of this verse) of brass, he lived. The record is brief and simple in the extreme, and tells nothing but the bare facts. The author of the Book of Wisdom understood the true bearing of those facts when he called the brazen serpent a σύμβολον σωτηρρίας (Wisdom 16:6), and when he wrote ὁ ἐπιστραφεὶς οὐ διὰ τὸ θεωρούμενον (the thing he looked at) ἐσώζετο ἀλλὰ διὰ σὲ τὸν πάντων σωτῆρα. At an earlier day Hezekiah had estimated the σύμβολον σωτηρίας at its true value, as being in itself worthless, and under certain circumstances mischievous (see on 2 Kings 18:4).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 21:10-35 THE END OF JOURNEYS, THE BEGINNING OF VICTORIES (verse 10-Numbers 22:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. In the list of chapter 33, there occur two other stations, Zahnonah and Phunon, between Mount Hor and Oboth. Phunon may be the Pinou of Genesis 36:41, but it is a mere conjecture. All we can conclude with any certainty is that the Israelites passed round the southern end of the mountains of Edom by the Wady el Ithm, and then marched northwards along the eastern border of Edom by the route now followed between Mekba and Damascus. On this side the mountains are far less precipitous and defensible than on the other, and this circumstance must have abated the insolence of the Edomites. Moreover, they must now have seen enough of Israel to know that, while immensely formidable in number and discipline, he had no hostile designs against them. It is therefore not surprising to find from Deuteronomy 2:6 that on this side the mountaineers supplied Israel with bread and water, just as they supply the pilgrim caravans at the present day. That they exacted payment for what they supplied was perfectly reasonable: no one could expect a poor people to feed a nation of two million souls, however nearly related, for nothing. Oboth has been identified with the modern halting-place of el-Ahsa, on the pilgrim route above mentioned, on the ground of supposed similarity in the meaning of the names; but the true rendering of Oboth is doubtful (see on Leviticus 19:31), and, apart from that, any such similarity of meaning is too vague and slight a ground for any argument to be built upon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And pitched at Ije-abarim. Ije (עִיִיּ), or Ijm (עִיִּים), as it is called in chapter Numbers 33:45, signifies \"heaps\" or \"ruins.\" Abarim is a word of somewhat doubtful meaning, best rendered \"ridges\" or \"ranges.\" It was apparently applied to the whole of Peraea in later times (cf. Jeremiah 22:20, \"passages\"), but in the Pentateuch is confined elsewhere to the ranges facing Jericho. These \"ruinous heaps of the ranges\" lay to the east of Moab, along the desert side of which Israel was now marching, still going northwards: they cannot-be identified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Pitched in the valley of Zared. Rather, \"in the brook of Zered.\" בְנַחַל זֶרֶד Perhaps the upper part of the Wady Kerek, which flows westwards into the Salt Sea (see on Deuteronomy 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Pitched on the other side of Arnon. The Arnon was without doubt the stream or torrent now known as the Wady Mojeb, which breaks its way down to the Salt Sea through a precipitous ravine. It must have been in the upper part of its course, in the desert uplands, that the Israelites crossed it; and this both because the passage lower down is extremely difficult, and also because they were keeping well to the eastward of Moabitish territory up to this point. It is not certain which side of the stream is intended by \"the other side,\" because the force of these expressions depends as often upon the point of view of the writer as of the reader. It would appear from Deuteronomy 2:26 that Israel remained at this spot until the embassage to Sihon had returned. That cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites, i.e., the Aruon, or perhaps one of its confluents which comes down from the northeast. For Arnon is the border of Moab. It was at that time the boundary (see on verse 26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Wherefore, i.e., because the Amorites had wrested from Moab all to the north of Arnon. In the book of the wars of the Lord. Nothing is known of this book but what appears here. If it should seem strange that a book of this description should be already in existence, we must remember that amongst the multitude of Israel there must in the nature of things have been some \"poets\" in the then acceptation of the word. Some songs there must have been, and those songs would be mainly inspired by the excitement and triumph of the final marches. The first flush of a new national life achieving its first victories over the national foe always finds expression in songs and odes. It is abundantly evident from the foregoing narrative that writing of some sort was in common use at least among the leaders of Israel (see on Numbers 11:26), and they would not have thought it beneath them to collect these spontaneous effusions of a nation just awaking to the poetry of its own existence. The archaic character of the fragments preserved in this chapter, which makes them sound so foreign to our ears, is a strong testimony to their genuineness. It is hardly credible that any one of a later generation should have cared either to compose or to quote snatches of song which, like dried flowers, have lost everything but scientific value in being detached from the soil which gave them birth. What he did in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon. Rather, \"Vaheb in whirlwind, and the brooks of Arnon.\" The strophe as cited here has neither nominative nor verb, and the sense can only be conjecturally restored. וָהֵב is almost certainly a proper name, although of an unknown place. בָּסוּפָה is also considered by many as the name of a locality \"in Suphah;\" it occurs, however, in Nahum 1:3 in the sense given above, and indeed it is not at all a rare word in Job, Proverbs, and the Prophets; it seems best, therefore, to give it the same meaning here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And at the stream of the brooks. Rather, \"and the pouring (וְאֶשֶׁד) of the brooks,\" i.e., the slope of the watershed. Ar. עָר is an archaic form of עִיר, a city. The same place is called Ar Moab in verse 28. It was situate on the Arnon somewhat lower down than where the Israelites crossed its \"brooks.\" The peculiarity of the site, \"in the midst of the river\" (Joshua 13:9, cf. Deuteronomy 2:36), and extensive ruins, have enabled travelers to identify the spot on which it stood at the junction of the Mojeb (Arnon) and Lejum (Nahaliel, verse 19). It is uncertain whether the Greeks gave the name of Areopolis, as Jerome asserts, to Ar, but in later times it was Rabbah, a town many miles further south in the heart of Moab which bore this name. Ar was at this period the boundary town of Moab, and as such was respected by the Israelites (Deuteronomy 2:9, 29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And from thence... to Beer.

Literally, \"by the lawgiver,\" or, as some prefer, \"with the scepter.\" The meaning of michokek is disputed (see on Genesis 49:10), but in either ease the meaning must be practically as in the A.V. It speaks of the alacrity with which the leaders of Israel, Moses himself amongst them, began the work even with the insignia of their office. And from the wilderness... to Mattanah.

Bamoth simply means \"heights\" or \"high places,\" and was therefore a frequent name. This Bamoth maybe the same as the Bamoth-Baal of chapter Numbers 22:41; Joshua 13:17, but it is uncertain. A Beth-Bamoth is mentioned on the Moabite stone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah. The original runs simply thus: \"And from Bamoth - the valley which in the field - Moab - the top - Pisgah.\" It may therefore be read, \"And from the heights to the valley that is in the field of Moab, viz., the top of Pisgah.\" The \"field\" of Moab (Septuagint, ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ) was no doubt the open, treeless expanse north of Arnon, drained by the Wady Waleh, which had formerly belonged to Moab. Pisgah (\"the ridge\") was a part of the Abarim ranges west of Heshbon, from the summit of which the first view is gained of the valley of Jordan and the hills of Palestine (cf. Numbers 33:47; Deuteronomy 3:27; Deuteronomy 34:1). Which looketh toward Jeshimon. Jeshimon, or \"the waste,\" seems to mean here that desert plain on the north-east side of the Salt Sea now called the Ghor el Belka, which included in its barren desolation the southernmost portion of the Jordan valley.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon. The narrative here returns to the point of time when the Israelites first reached the Upper Arnon, the boundary stream of the kingdom of Sihon (see on verse 13, and cf. Deuteronomy 2:24-37). The list of stations in the preceding verses may probably have been copied out of some official record; it may be considered as marking the movements of the tabernacle with Eleazar and the Levites and the mass of the non-combatant population. In the mean time the armies of Israel were engaged in victorious enterprises which took them far afield. King of the Amorites. The Amorites were not akin to the Hebrews, as the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites were, who all claimed descent from Terah. They were of the Canaanitish stock (Genesis 10:16), and indeed the name Amorite often appears as synonymous with Canaanite in its larger sense (Deuteronomy 1:7, 19, 27, &c.). If at one time they are mentioned side by side with five or six other tribes of the same stock (Exodus 34:11), yet at another they seem to be so much the representative race that \"the Ammorite\" stands for the inhabitants of Canaan in general whom Israel was commissioned to oust on account of his iniquity (Genesis 15:16). It is not, therefore, possible to draw any certain distinction between the Amorites of Sihon's kingdom and the mass of the Canaanites on the other side Jordan. Both Sihon and his people appear as intruders in this region, having come down perhaps from the northern parts of Palestine, and having but recently (it would seem) wrested from the king of Moab all his territory north of Arnon. It was the fact of the Amorites being found here which led to the conquest and settlement of the trans-Jordanic territory. That territory was not apparently included in the original gift (compare Numbers 34:2-12 with Genesis 10:19 and Genesis 15:19-21), but since the Amorite had possessed himself of it, it must pass with all the rest of his habitation to the chosen people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let me pass through thy land. Cf. Numbers 20:17. Israel was not commanded to spare the Amorites, indeed he was under orders to smite them (Deuteronomy 2:24), but that did not prevent his approaching them in the first instance with words of peace. If Sihon had hearkened, no doubt Israel would have passed directly on to Jordan, and he would at least have been spared for the present.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And he came to Jahaz, or Jahzah, a place of which we know nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword. This was the first time that generation had seen war, if we except the uncertain episode of the king of Arad, and they could have had no weapons but such as their fathers had brought out of Egypt. It was, therefore, a critical moment in their history when they met the forces of Sihon, confident from their recent victory over Moab. We may suppose that Joshua was their military leader now, as before and after. From Arnon unto Jabbok. The Jabbok, which formed the boundary of Sihon on the north towards the kingdom of Og, and on the east towards the Ammonites, is the modern Zerka: it runs in a large curve northeast, north-west, and west, until it fails into Jordan, forty-five miles north of the mouth of the Arnon. Even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. This is perhaps intended to explain rather why the Amorites had not extended their conquests any further, than why the Israelites made no attempt to cross the border of Ammon; they had another and more sufficient reason (see Deuteronomy 2:19). Rabbah of Ammon, which stood upon the right (here the eastern) bank of the Upper Jabbok, was an extremely strong place which effectually protected the country behind it, even until the reign of David (see on 2 Samuel 11, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites. The territory overrun at this time was about fifty miles north and south, by nearly thirty east and west. It was not permanently occupied until a somewhat later period (Numbers 32:33); but we may suppose that the flocks and herds, with sufficient forces to guard them, spread themselves at once over the broad pasture lands. Heshbon, and all the villages, thereof. Literally, \"the daughters thereof. By a similar figure we speak of a \"mother city.\" Heshbon occupied a central position in the kingdom of Sihon, half way between Arnon and Jabbok, and about eighteen miles eastward of the point where Jordan falls into the Salt Lake; it stood on a table-land nearly 3000 feet above the sea, and had been made his city (i.e. his capital) by Sihon at the time of his victories over Moab.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - All his land.

Septuagint, οἰ αἰνιγματισταί. A class of persons well marked among the Hebrews, as perhaps in all ancient countries. It was their gift, and almost their profession, to express in the sententious, antistrophic poetry of the age such thoughts or such facts as took hold of men's minds. At a time when there was little difference between poetry and rhetoric, and when the distinction was hardly drawn between the inventive faculty of man and the Divine afflatus, it is not surprising to find the word mashal applied to the rhapsody of Balsam (Numbers 23:7), to the \"taunting song\" of Isaiah (Isaiah 14:4), to the \"riddle\" of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 17:2), as well as to the collection of earthly and heavenly wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. That which follows is a taunting song, most like to the one cited from Isaiah, the archaic character of which is marked by its strongly antithetic form and abrupt transitions, as well as by the peculiarity of some of the words. Come to Heshbon. This may be ironically addressed to the Amorites, lately so victorious, now so overthrown; or, possibly, it may be intended to express the jubilation of the Amorites themselves in the day of their pride.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - There is a fire gone out of Heshbon. This must refer to the war-fire which the Amorites kindled from Heshbon when they made it the capital of the new kingdom. Ar Moab and the (northern) heights of Arnon were the furthest points to which their victory extended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - O people of Chemosh. עַם־כָּמוּשׁ. Chemosh was the national god of the Moabites (1 Kings 11:7; Jeremiah 48:7), and also to some extent of the Ammonites (Judges 11:24). It is generally agreed that the name is derived from the root כבש, to subdue, and thus will have substantially the same meaning as Milcom, Molech, and Baal; indeed it appears probable that there was a strong family likeness among the idolatries of Palestine, and that the various names represented different attributes of one supreme being rather than different divinities. Thus Baal and Ashtaroth (Judges 2:13) represented for the Zidonians the masculine and feminine elements respectively in the Divine energy. Baal himself was plural (Baalim, 1 Kings 18:18) in form, and either male or female (ἡ βάαλ in Hosea 2:8; Romans 11:4). In the inscription on the Moabite stone a god \"Ashtar-Chemosh\" is mentioned, and thus Chemosh is identified with the male deity of Phoenicia (Ashtar being the masculine form of Ashtoreth), while, on the other hand, it was almost certainly the same divinity who was worshipped under another name, and with other rites, as Baal-Peor (see on Numbers 25:3). On the coins of Areopolis Chemosh appears as a god of war armed, with fire-torches by his side. Human sacrifices were offered to him (2 Kings 3:26, 27), as to Baal and to Moloch. He hath given his sons, i.e., Chemosh, who could not save his own votaries, nor the children of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - We have shot at them. וַגִּירָם. A poetical word of somewhat doubtful meaning. It is generally supposed to be a verbal form (first person plural imperf. Kal), from יָרָה, with an unusual suffix (cf. יִלְבָּשָׁם for יִלְבָּשֵׁם in Exodus 29:30). יָרָה has the primary meaning \"to shoot at,\" the secondary, \"to overthrow,\" as in Exodus 15:4. Others, however, derive the word from ארה, a root supposed to mean \"burn.\" Even unto Dibon. See on Numbers 32:34. The site of Nophah, perhaps the Nobah of Judges 8:11, is unknown. Which reacheth unto Medeba. The reading is uncertain here as well as the meaning. The received text has אֵַשֶׁר עַד־מַידבָא, which gives no meaning, but the circle over the resh marks it as suspicious. The Septuagint (πῦρ ἐπ Μωάβ) and the Samaritan evidently read אֵשׁ, and this has been generally followed: \"we have wasted even unto Nophah, - with fire unto Medeba.\" Medeba, of which the ruins are still known by the same name, lay five or six miles south-south-east of Heshbon. It was a fortress in the time of David (1 Chronicles 19:7) and of Omri, as appears from the Moabite stone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Jaazer.

The brevity of the narrative does not allow us to know who went upon this expedition, or why they went. It may have been only the detachment which had reconnoitered and taken Jaazer, and they may have found themselves threatened by the forces of Og, and so led on to further conquests beyond the Jabbok. Og the king of Bashan. Og was himself of the aboriginal giant race which had left so many remnants, or at least so many memories, in these regions (see on Deuteronomy 2:10-12, 20-23; Joshua 12:4; 13:12); but he is classed with Sihon as a king of the Amorites (Joshua 2:10) because his people were chiefly at least of that race. Bashan itself comprised the plain now known as Jaulan and Haulan beyond the Jarmuk (now Mandhur), the largest affluent of the Jordan, which joins it a few miles below the lake of Tiberias. The kingdom of Og, however, extended over the northern and larger part of Gilead, a much more fertile territory than Bashan proper (see on Deuteronomy 3:1-17). At Edrei. Probably the modern Edhra'ah, or Der'a, situate on a branch of the Jarmuk, some twenty-four miles from Bozrah. The ancient city lies buried beneath the modern village, and was built, like the other cities of Bashan, in the most massive style of architecture. The cities of Og were so strong that the Israelites could not have dispossessed him by any might of their own if he had abode behind his walls. Either confidence in his warlike prowess or some more mysterious cause (see on Joshua 24:12) impelled him to leave his fortifications, and give battle to the Israelites to his own utter defeat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Fear him not. He might well have been formidable, not only on account of his size (cf. Deuteronomy 1:28; Deuteronomy 3:11; 1 Samuel 17:11), but from the formidable nature of those walled cities which are still a wonder to all that see them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers21:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - So they smote him.

Not necessarily after the defeats of Sihon and Og; it is quite as likely that this last journey was made while the armies were away on their northern conquests. And pitched in the plains of Moab. The Arboth Moab, or steppes of Moab, were those portions of the Jordan valley which had belonged to Moab perhaps as far north as the Jabbok.

That this section of the Book of Numbers has a character to a great extent peculiar and isolated is evident upon the face of it. The arguments indeed derived from its language and style to prove that it is by a different hand from the rest of the Book are obviously too slight and doubtful to be of any weight; there does not seem to be any more diversity in this respect than the difference of subject matter would lead us to expect. The peculiarity, however, of this section is evident from the fact that these three chapters, confessedly so important and interesting in themselves, might be taken away without leaving any perceptible void. From Numbers 22:1 the narrative is continued in chapter 25, apparently without a break, and in that chapter there is no mention of Balaam. It is only in chapter 31. (verses 8, 16) that two passing allusions are made to him: in the one his death is noted without comment; in the other we are made acquainted for the first time with a fact which throws a most important light upon his character and career, of which no hint is given in the section before us. Thus it is evident that the story of Balaam's coming and prophecies, although imbedded in the narrative (and that in the fight place as to order of time), is not structurally connected with it, but forms an episode by itself. If we now take this section, which is thus isolated and self-contained, we shall not fail to see at once that its literary character is strikingly peculiar. It is to all intents and purposes a sacred drama wherein characters and events of the highest interest are handled with consummate art. No one can be insensible to this, whatever construction he may or may not put upon it. Probably the story of Balaam was never made the subject of a miracle play, because the character of the chief actor is too subtle for the crude intelligence of the age of miracle plays. But if the sacred drama were ever reintroduced, it is certain that no more effective play could be found than that of Balaam and Balak. The extraordinary skill with which the strangely complex character of the wizard prophet is drawn out; the felicity with which it is contrasted with the rude simplicity of Balak; the picturesque grandeur of the scenery and incident; and the art with which the story leads up by successive stages to the final and complete triumph of God and of Israel, are worthy, from a merely artistic point of view, of the greatest of dramatic poets. There is no such minute drawing out of an isolated character by means of speech and incident to be found in the Old Testament, unless it be in the Book of Job, the dramatic form of which serves to give point to the comparison; but few would fail to see that the much more subtle character of Balaam is far more distinctly indicated than that of Job. Balaam is emphatically a \"study,\" and must have been intended to he so. Yet it must be remembered that it is only to modern eyes that this part of the varied truth and wisdom of Holy Scripture has become manifest. To the Jew Balaam was interesting only as a great foe, greatly baffled; as a sorcerer whose ghostly power and craft was broken and turned backward by the God of Israel (Deuteronomy 23:5; Joshua 13:22; Joshua 24:10; Micah 6:5). To the Christian of the first age he was only interesting as the Scriptural type of the subtlest and most dangerous kind of enemy whom the Church of God had to dread - the enemy who united spiritual pretensions with persuasions to vice (Revelation 2:14). To the more critical intellects of later ages, such even as Augustine and Jerome, he was altogether a puzzle; the one regarding him as prophetam diaboli, whose religion was a mere cloak for covetousness; the other as prophetam Dei, whose fall was like unto the fall of the old prophet of Bethel. The two parallel allusions to his character in 2 Peter 2:15, 16; Jude 1:11 do not take us any further, merely turning upon the covetousness which was his most obvious fault. Unquestionably, however, Balaam is most interesting to us, not from any of these points of view, but as a study drawn by an inspired hand of a strangely but most naturally mixed character, the broad features of which are constantly being reproduced, in the same unhallowed union, in men of all ]ands and ages. This is undeniably one of the instances (not perhaps very numerous) in which the more trained and educated intelligence of modern days has a distinct advantage over the simpler faith and intenser piety of the first ages. The conflict, or rather the compromise, in Balaam between true religion and superstitious imposture, between an actual Divine inspiration and the practice of heathen sorceries, between devotion to God and devotion to money, was an unintelligible puzzle to men of old. To those who have grasped the character of a Louis XI, of a Luther, or of an Oliver Cromwell, or have gauged the mixture of highest and lowest in the religious movements of modern history, the wonder is, not that such an one should have been, but that such an one should have been so simply and yet so skillfully depicted. Two questions arise pre-eminently out of the story of Balaam which our want of knowledge forbids us to answer otherwise than doubtfully.NEWLINENEWLINEI. Whence did Balaam derive his knowledge of the true God, and how far did it extend? Was he, as some have argued, a heathen sorcerer who took to invoking Jehovah because circumstances led him to believe that the cause of Jehovah was likely to be the winning cause? and did the God whom he invoked in this mercenary spirit (after the fashion of the sons of Sceva) take advantage of the fact to obtain an ascendancy over his mind, and to compel his unwilling obedience? Such an assumption seems at once unnatural and unnecessary. It is hardly conceivable that God should have bestowed a true prophetic gift upon one who stood in such a relation to him. Moreover, the kind of ascendancy which the word of God had over the mind of Balaam is not one which springs from calculation, or from a mere intellectual persuasion. The man who lives before us in these chapters has not only a considerable knowledge of, but a very large amount of faith in, the one true God; he walks with God; he sees him that is invisible; the presence of Gods and God's direct concern about his doings are as familiar and unquestioned elements of his everyday life as they were of Abraham's. In a word (whatever difficulties a shallow theology may find in the fact), he has religious faith in God, a faith which is naturally strong, and has been further intensified by special revelations of the unseen; and this faith is the basis and condition of his prophetic gift. Balaam's religion, therefore, on this side was neither an hypocrisy nor an assumption; it was a real conviction which had grown up with him and formed part of his inner self. It is true that in Joshua 13:22 he is called a soothsayer (kosem), a name of reproach and infamy among the Jews (cf. 1 Samuel 15:23, \"witchcraft;\" Jeremiah 14:14, \"divination\"); but no one doubts that he played for gain the part of a soothsayer, employing with more or less of inward unbelief and contempt the arts of heathen sorcery; and it was quite natural that Joshua should recognize only the lower and more obvious side of his enemy's character. It remains then to consider how Balaam, living in Mesopotamia, could have had so considerable a knowledge of the true God; and the only satisfactory answer is this, that such knowledge had never disappeared from that region. Every glimpse which is afforded us of the descendants of Nahor in their Mesopotamian home confirms the belief that they were substantially at one with the chosen family in religious feeling and religious speech. Bethuel and Laban acknowledged the same God, and called him by the same name as Isaac and Jacob (Genesis 24:50; Genesis 31:49). No doubt idolatrous practices prevailed in their household (Genesis 31:19; Genesis 35:2; Joshua 24:2), but that, however dangerous, was not fatal to the existence of the true faith amongst them, any more than is the existence of a similar cultus amongst Christians. Centuries had indeed passed away since the days of Laban, and during those centuries we may well conclude that the common people had developed the idolatrous practices of their fathers, until they wholly obscured the worship of the one true God. But the lapse of years and the change of popular belief make little difference to the secret and higher teaching of countries like the Mesopotamia of that age, which is intensely conservative both for good and evil. Men like Balaam, who probably had an hereditary claim to his position as a seer, remained purely monotheistic in creed, and in their hearts called only upon the God of all the earth, the God of Abraham and of Nahor, of Melchizedec and of Job, of Laban and of Jacob. If we knew enough of the religious history of that land, it is possible that we might be able to point to a tolerably complete succession of gifted (in many cases Divinely-gifted) men, servants and worshippers of the one true God, down to the Magi who first hailed the rising of the bright and morning Star. There is connected with this question another of much narrower interest which causes great perplexity. Balaam (and indeed Balak too) freely uses the sacred name by which God had revealed himself as the God of Israel (see on Exodus 6:2, 3). There are two views of this matter, one or other of which is tolerably certain, and for both of which much may be said: either the sacred name was widely known and used beyond the limits of Israel, or else the sacred historian must have freely put it into the mouths of people who actually used some other name. There are also two views both of which may be summarily rejected, because their own advocates have reduced them to absolute absurdity: the one is, that the use of the two names Elohim and Jehovah shows a difference of authorship; the other, that they are employed by the same author with variety of sense - Elohim (God) being the God of nature, Jehovah (the Lord) the God of grace. It is no doubt true that there are passages where the sole use, or the pointed use, of one or other of these names does really point to a diversity either of authorship or of meaning; but it is abundantly clear that in the general narrative of Scripture, including these chapters, not the least distinction whatever can be drawn between the use of Elohim and Jehovah which will stand the simplest test of common sense; the same ingenuity which explains the occurrence of Elohim instead of Jehovah in any particular sentence would find an explanation quite as satisfactory if it were Jehovah instead of Elohim.NEWLINENEWLINEII. Whence did Moses obtain his knowledge of the incidents here recorded, many of which must have been known to Balaam alone? Was it directly, by revelation; or from some memorials left by Balaam himself? The former supposition, once generally held, is as generally abandoned now, because it is perceived that inspiration over-ruled and utilized for Divine purposes, but did not supersede, natural sources of information. The latter supposition is rendered more probable by these considerations: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That a man of Balaam's character and training would be very likely to put on record the remarkable things which had happened to himself. Such men who habitually lead a double life are often keenly. alive to their own errors, and are singularly frank in writing themselves down for the benefit of posterity.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That Balaam was slain among the Midianites, and that his effects must have fallen into the hands of the victors. On the other hand, it is inconceivable that Balaam, being what he was, should have written these chapters at all as they stand; the moral and religious intent of the story is too evident in itself, and is too evidently governed by Jewish faith and feeling. It may be allowable to put it before the reader as an opinion which may or may not be true, but which is quite compatible with profound belief in the inspired truth of this part of God's word, that Moses, having obtained the facts in the way above indicated, was moved to work them up into the dramatic form in which they now appear - a form which undoubtedly brings out the character of the actors, the struggle between light and darkness, and the final triumph of light, with much more force (and therefore much more truth) than anything else could. If it be objected that this gives a fictitious character to the narrative, it may be replied that when the imagination is called into exercise to present actual facts, existing characters, and prophecies really uttered in a striking light, - and that under the over-ruling guidance of the Divine Spirit, - the result cannot be called fictitious in any bad or unworthy sense. If it be added that such a theory attributes to this section a character different from the rest of the Book, it may be allowed at once. The episode of Balaam and Balak is obviously, as to literary form, distinct from and strongly contrasted with the narrative which precedes and follows. It has been made a question as to the language in which Balaam and his companions spoke and wrote. The discovery of the Moabite stone has made it certain that the language of the Moabites, and in all probability of the other races descended from Abraham and Lot, was practically the same as the language of the Jews. Balaam's own tongue may have been Aramaic, but amongst his western friends and patrons he would no doubt he perfectly ready to speak as they spoke.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 22:1-40.

Balak was, as is presently explained, the king of Moab at this time, but not the king from whom Sihon had wrested so much of his territory (Numbers 21:26). He seems to be mentioned by name on a papyrus in the British Museum (see Brugseh, 'Geogr. Inschr.,' 2, page 32).

But after the sudden defeat and overthrow of their own Amorite conquerors, their terror and uneasiness forced them to take some action, although they dared not commence open hostilities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Moab said unto the elders of Midian. The Midianites were descended from Abraham and Keturah (Genesis 25:2, 4), and were thus more nearly of kin to Israel than to Moab. They lived a semi-nomadic life on the steppes to the east of Moab and Ammon (cf. Genesis 36:35), supporting themselves partly by grazing, and partly by the caravan trade (Genesis 37:28). Their institutions were no doubt patriarchal, like those of the modern Bedawin, and the \"elders\" were the sheiks of their tribes. As the ox licketh up the grass of the field. The strong, scythe-like sweep of the ox's tongue was a simile admirable in itself, and most suitable to pastoral Moab and Midian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He sent messengers therefore. It appears from verse 7 that Balak acted for Midian as well as for Moab; as the Midianites were but a weak people, they may have placed themselves more or less under the protection of Balak. Unto Balaam the son of Beer. בִּלְעָם (Bileam: our common form is from the Septuagint and New Testament, Βαλαάμ) is derived either from בָּלַע, to destroy or devour, and עָם, the people; or simply from בָּלַע, with the terminal syllable אָּם, \"the destroyer.\" The former derivation receives some support from Revelation 2:14, 15, where \"Nicolaitans\" are thought by many to be only a Greek form of\" Balaamites\" Νικόλαος, from νικάω and λαός). Beor (בְּעוּר) has a similar signification, from בָּעָר, to burn, or consume. Both names have probable reference to the supposed effect of their maledictions, for successful cursing was an hereditary profession in many. lands, as it still is in some. Beer appears in 2 Peter 2:15 as Bosor, which is called a Chaldeeism, but the origin of the change is really unknown. A \"Bela son of Beer\" is named in Genesis 36:32 as reigning in Edom, but the coincidence is of no importance: kings and magicians have always loved to give themselves names of fear, and their vocabulary was not extensive. To Pother, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people. Rather, \"which is on the river,\" i.e., the great river Euphrates, \"in the land of the children of his people,\" i.e., in his native land. The situation of Pethor (Septuagint, Φαθουρά) is unknown. Here is a people come out of Egypt. Forty years had passed since their fathers had left Egypt. Yet Balak's words expressed a great truth, for this people was no wandering desert tribe, but for all intents the same great organized nation which had spoiled Egypt, and left Pharaoh's host dead behind them. They abide over against me מִמֻּלִי. Septuagint, ἐχόμενός μου. This would hardly have been said when Israel was encamped thirty miles north of Arnon, opposite to Jericho. The two embassies to Balaam must have occupied some time, and in the mean while Israel would have gone further on his way. We may naturally conclude that the first message was sent immediately after the defeat of Sihon, at a time when Israel was encamped very near the border of Moab.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. This was the language of flattery intended to secure the prophet's services. No doubt, however, Balak, like other heathens, had a profound though capricious belief in the real effect of curses and anathemas pronounced by men who had private intercourse and influence with the unseen powers. That error, like most superstitions, was the perversion of a truth; there are both benedictions and censures which, uttered by human lips, carry with them the sanction and enforcement of Heaven. The error of antiquity lay in ignorance or forgetfulness that, as water cannot rise higher than its source, so neither blessing nor cursing can possibly take any effect beyond the will and purpose of the Father of our souls. Balaam knew this, but it was perhaps his misfortune to have been trained from childhood to maintain his position and his wealth by trading upon the superstitions of his neighbours.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - With the rewards of divination. קְסָמִים, \"soothsayings.\" Septuagint, τὰ μαντεῖα. Here the soothsayer's wages, which St. Peter aptly calls the wages of unrighteousness. The ease with which, among ignorant and superstitious people, a prophet might become a hired soothsayer is apparent even from the case of Samuel (1 Samuel 9:6-8). That it should be thought proper to resort to the man of God for information about some lost property, and much more that it should be thought necessary to pay him a fee for the exercise of his supernatural powers, shows, not indeed that Samuel was a soothsayer, for he was a man of rare integrity and independence, but, that Samuel was but little distinguished from a soothsayer in the popular estimation. If Samuel had learnt to care more for money than for righteousness, he might very easily have become just what Balaam became.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Lodge here this night. It was therefore in the night, in a dream or in a vision (cf. Genesis 20:3; Numbers 12:6; Job 4:15, 16), that Balaam expected to receive some communication from God. If he had received none he would no doubt have felt himself free to go.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - More, and more honourable than they. Balak rightly judged that Balaam was not really unwilling to come, and that it was only needful to ply him with more flattery and larger promises. The heathens united a firm belief in the powers of the seer with a very shrewd appreciation of the motives and character of the seer. Compare the saying of Sophocles ('Antig.,' 1055), τὸ μαντικὸν γὰρ πᾶν φιλάργυρον γένος.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God. Balaam's faith was paramount within its own sphere of operation. It did not control his wishes; it did not secure the heart obedience which God loves; but it did secure, and that absolutely, outward obedience to every positive command of God, however irksome; and Balaam never made any secret of this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And God's anger was kindled because he went, or, \"that he was going.\" כִּי־הולֵך הוּא. Septuagint, ὅτι ἐπορεύθη αὐτός. There can be no question that the ordinary translation is fight, and that God was angry with Balaam for going at all on such an errand. It is true that God had given him permission to go, but that very permission was a judicial act whereby God punished the covetous and disobedient longings of Balaam in allowing him to have his own way. God's anger is kindled by sin, and it was not less truly sin which prompted Balaam to go because he had succeeded in obtaining formal leave to go. The angel of the Lord stood in the way. The same angel of the covenant apparently of whom Moses had spoken to the Edomites (see on Numbers 20:16). For an adversary against him. לְשָׂטָן לו. Septuagint, διαβαλεῖν αὐτόν, Not so much because Balaam was rushing upon his own destruction as because he was going to fight with curses, if possible, against the Israel of God (cf. 2 Kings 6:17; Psalm 34:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And the ass saw the angel of the Lord. This was clearly part of the miracle, the σήμειον which was to exhibit in such a striking manner the stupidity and blindness of the most brilliant and gifted intellect when clouded by greed and selfishness. It is nothing to the point that the lower animals have a quicker perception of some natural phenomena than men, for this was not a natural phenomenon; it is nothing to the point that the lower animals are credited by some with possessing \"the second sight,\" for all that belongs to the fantastic and legendary. If the ass saw the angel, it was because the Lord opened her eyes then, as he did her mouth afterwards.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - She thrust herself unto the wall. Apparently in order to pass the angel beyond the reach of his sword; when this was clearly impossible she fell down.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass. On the face of it this expression would seem decisive that an audible human voice proceeded from the ass's mouth, as St. Peter beyond doubt believed: ὑποζύγιον ἀφωνον ἐν ἀνθρώτου φωνῇ φθεγξάμενον. It is truly said, however, that a passing illusion of this kind, while it testifies that the Apostle understood the words, like all his contemporaries, in their most natural and simple sense, does not oblige us to hold the same view; if he was mistaken in this matter, it does not at all affect the inspired truth of his teaching. Two theories, therefore, have been proposed in order to avoid the difficulties of the ordinary belief, while vindicating the reality of the occurrence. It has been held by some that the whole affair took place in a trance, and resembled St. Peter's vision of the sheet let down from heaven (Acts 10:10), which we rightly conceive to have been purely subjective. This is open to the obvious and apparently fatal objection that no hint is given of any state of trance or ecstasy, and that, on the contrary, the wording of the narrative as given to us is inconsistent with such a thing. In verse 31 Balaam's eyes are said to have been opened so that he saw the angel; but to have the eyes open so that the (ordinarily) invisible became visible, and the (otherwise) inaudible became audible, was precisely the condition of which Balaam speaks (Numbers 24:3, 4) as that of trance. According to the narrative, therefore, Balaam was in an ecstasy, if at all, after the speaking of the ass, and not before. By others it has been put forward, somewhat confusedly, that although Balaam was in his ordinary senses, he did not really hear a human voice, but that the \"cries\" of the ass became intelligible to his mind; and it is noted that as an augur he had been accustomed to assign meanings to the cries of animals. If instead of \"cries\" we read \"brayings,\" for the ass is endowed by nature with no other capacity of voice, being indeed one of the dumbest of \"dumb\" animals, we have the matter more fairly before us. To most people it would appear more incredible that the brayings of an ass should convey these rational questions to the mind of its rider than that the beast should have spoken outright with a man's voice. It would indeed seem much more satisfactory to regard the story, if we cannot accept it as literally true, as a parable which Balaam wrote against himself, and which Moses simply incorporated in the narrative; we should at least preserve in this way the immense moral and spiritual value of the story, without the necessity of placing non-natural constructions upon its simple statements. Supposing the miracle to have really occurred, it must always be observed that the words put into the ass's mouth do nothing more than express such feeling's as a docile and intelligent animal of her kind would have actually felt. That domestic animals, and especially such as have been long in the service of man, feel surprise, indignation, and grief in the presence of injustice and ill-treatment is abundantly certain. In many well-authenticated cases they have done things in order to express these feelings which seemed as much beyond their \"irrational\" nature as if they had spoken. We constantly say of a dog or a horse that he can do everything but speak, and why should it seem incredible that God, who has given the dumb beast so close an approximation to human feeling and reason, should for once have given it human voice? With respect to Balaam's companions, their presence need not cause any difficulty. The princes of Midian and Moab had probably gone on to announce the coming of Beldam; his servants would naturally follow him at some little distance, unless he summoned them to his side. It is very likely too that Balaam was wont to carry on conversations with himself, or with imaginary beings, as he rode along, and this circumstance would account for any sound of voices which reached the ears of others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And Balaam said unto the ass. That Beldam should answer the ass without expressing any astonishment is certainly more marvelous than that the ass should speak to him. It must, however, in fairness be considered -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That Balaam was a prophet. He was accustomed to hear Divine voices speaking to him when no man was near. He had a large and unquestioning faith, and a peculiar familiarity with the unseen.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Balaam was a sorcerer. It was part of his profession to show signs and wonders such as even now in those countries confound the most experienced and skeptical beholders. It is likely that he had often made dumb animals speak in order to bewilder others. He must indeed have been conscious to some extent of imposture, but he would not draw any sharp line in his own mind between the marvels which really happened to him and the marvels he displayed to others. Both as prophet and as sorcerer, he must have lived, more than any other even of that age, in an atmosphere of the supernatural. If, therefore, this portent was really given, it was certainly given to the very man of all that ever lived to whom it was most suitable. Just as one cannot imagine the miracle of the stater (Matthew 17:27) happening to any one of less simple and childlike faith than St. Peter, so one could not think of the ass as speaking to any one in the Bible but the wizard prophet, for whom - both on his good and on his bad side - the boundary lines between the natural and supernatural were almost obliterated.NEWLINENEWLINE3. Balaam was at this moment intensely angry., and nothing blunts the edge of natural surprise so much as rage. Things which afterwards, when calmly recollected, cause the utmost astonishment, notoriously produce no effect at the moment upon a mind which is thoroughly exasperated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel. As on other occasions, the angel was not perceptible to ordinary sight, but only to eyes in some way quickened and purged by the Divine operation. This explains the fact that Balaam's companions would appear to have seen nothing (cf. Acts 9:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Because thy way is perverse. יָרָט, an uncommon word, which seems to mean \"leading headlong,\" 1.e. to destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Unless ... surely. אוּלַיאּאּ־כִּי. It is somewhat doubtful whether this phrase can be translated as in the Septuagint (εἰ μὴ.. νῦν οῦν)and in all the versions; but even if the construction of the sentence be broken, this is no doubt the meaning of it. And saved her alive. Compare the case of the ass of the disobedient prophet in 1 Kings 13:24. It is plainly a righteous thing with God that obedience and faithfulness should be respected, and in some sense rewarded, even in an ass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Go with the men. It may be asked to what purpose the angel appeared, if Balaam was to proceed just the same. The answer is that the angel was not a warning, but a destroying, angel, a visible embodiment of the anger of God which burnt against Beldam for his perversity. The angel would have slain Balaam, as the lion slew the disobedient prophet, but that God in his mercy permitted the fidelity and wisdom of the ass to save her master from the immediate consequences of his folly. If Balaam had had a mind capable of instruction, he would indeed have gone on as he was bidden, but in a very different spirit and with very different designs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Unto a city of Moab, or, \"unto Ir-Moab\" (אֶל־עִיר מואָב), probably the same as the Ar mentioned in chapter Numbers 21:15 as the boundary town of Moab at that time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Kirjath-huzoth. \"City of streets.\" Identified by some with the ruins of Shian, not far from the supposed site of Ai.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Balak offered oxen and sheep. Probably these sacrifices were offered not to Chemosh, but to the Lord, in whose name Balaam always spoke. Indeed the known fact that Beldam was a prophet of the Lord was no doubt one of Balak's chief reasons for wishing to obtain his services. Balak shared the common opinion of antiquity, that the various national deities were enabled by circumstances past human understanding to do sometimes more, sometimes less, for their special votaries. He perceived that the God of Israel was likely, as things stood, to carry all before him; but he thought that he might by judicious management be won over, at least to some extent, to desert the cause of Israel and to favour that of Moab. To this end he \"retained\" at great cost the services of Balaam, the prophet of the Lord, and to this end he was willing to offer any number of sacrifices. Even the resolute and self-reliant Romans believed in the wisdom of such a policy. Thus Pliny quotes ancient authors as affirming \"in oppugnationibus ante omnia solitum a Romanis sacrdotibus evocari Deum, cujus in tutela id oppidum esset, promittique illi eundem aut ampliorem apud Romanos cultum,\" and he adds, \"durat in Pontificum disciplina id sacrum, constatque ideo occultatum, in cujus Dei tutela Roma esset, ne qui hostium simili modo agerent.\" And sent, i.e., portions of the sacrificial meats.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 22:41; 23, 24NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers22:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEChapter 22:41. - The high places of Baal, or \"Bamoth-Baal.\" Perhaps the Bamoth mentioned in Numbers 21:19, 20. This is, however, by no means certain, because high places were no doubt numerous, and that Bamoth would seem to have been too far from the present camp of Israel. In any case they crossed the Arnon, and ran some risk by adventuring themselves on hostile territory. That thence he might see the utmost part of the people. According to the quasi-sacramental character attributed to the cursing of a seer, it was held necessary that the subject of the curse should be in view. Balak desired to attain this object with as little risk as possible, and therefore he took Balaam first of all to these heights, whence a distant and partial view of Israel might be had.NEWLINE","Num.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.VERSEENDNEWLINEChapter 23:1. - Build me here seven altars. According to the common opinion of the heathen, it was necessary to propitiate with sacrifices the God with whom they had to do, and if possible to secure his favourable consideration on their side. The number seven was especially connected with the revelation of the tree God, the Creator of the world, and was probably observed here for this reason. The sacrifices were offered no doubt to Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Peradventure the Lord will come to meet me. It might be concluded from Numbers 24:1 that Balaam went only to look for \"auguries,\" i.e., for such natural signs in the flight of birds and the like as the heathen were wont to observe as manifestations of the favour or disfavour of God, the success or failure of enterprises. It seems clear that it was his practice to do so, either as having some faith himself in such uncertainties, or as stooping to usual heathen arts which he inwardly despised. But from the fact that God met him (we know not how), and that such supernatural communication was not unexpected, we may conclude that Balaam's words meant more for himself than the mere observance of auguries, whatever they may have meant for Balak. To an high place. Rather, \"to a bald place\" (שֶׁפִי - compare the meaning of \"Calvary\"), from which the immediate prospect was uninterrupted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I have prepared seven altars. Balaam, acting for the king of Moab, his heathen patron, in this difficult business, points out to God that he had given him the full quota of sacrifices to begin with. It was implied in this reminder that God would naturally feel disposed to do something for Balaam in return.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Took up his parable. מָשָׁל (cf. Numbers 21:27). Balaam's utterances were in the highest degree poetical, according to the antithetic form of the poetry of that day, which delighted in sustained parallelisms, in lofty figures, and in abrupt turns. The \"mashal\" of Balaam resembled the \"burden\" of the later prophets in this, that it was not a discourse uttered to men, but a thing revealed in him of which he had to deliver himself as best he might in such words as came to him. His inward eye was fixed on this revelation, and he gave utterance to it without consideration of those who heard. Aram, i.e., Aram-Naharaim, or Mesopotamia (cf. Genesis 29:1; Deuteronomy 23:4). Defy, or \"threaten,' i.e., with the wrath of Heaven. Jacob. The use of this name as the poetical equivalent of Israel shows that Balaam was familiar with the story of the patriarch, and understood his relation to the people before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned. Rather, \"It is a people that dwelleth apart, and is not numbered.\" It was not the outward isolation on which his eye was fixed, for that indeed was only temporary and accidental, but the religious and moral separateness of Israel as the chosen people of God, which was the very secret of their national greatness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The fourth part of Israel. אֶת־רבַע is so rendered by the Targums, as alluding to the four great camps into which the host was divided. The Septuagint has δήμους, apparently from an incorrect reading. The Samaritan and the older versions, followed by the Vulgate, render it \"progeny,'\" but this meaning is conjectural, and there seems no sufficient reason to depart from the common translation. Let me die the death of the righteous. The word \"righteous\" is in the plural (יְשָׁרִים, δικαίων): it may refer either to the Israelites as a holy nation, living and dying in the favour of God; or to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, the promises made to whom, in faith of which they died, were already so gloriously fulfilled. If the former reference was intended, Balaam must have had a much fuller and happier knowledge of \"life and immortality\" than the Israelites themselves, to whom death was dreadful, all the more that it ended a life protected and blessed by God (cf. e.g., Psalm 88:10-12; Isaiah 38:18, 19). It is hardly credible that so singular an anticipation of purely Christian feeling should really be found in the mouth of a prophet of that day, for it is clear that the words, however much inspired, did express the actual emotion of Balaam at the moment. It is therefore more consistent with the facts and probabilities of the case to suppose that Balaam referred to righteous Abraham (cf. Isaiah 41:2) and his immediate descendants, and wished that when he came to die he might have as sure a hope as they had enjoyed that God would bless and multiply their seed, and make their name to be glorious in the earth. Let my last end be like his. אַחַרִית (last end) is the same word translated \"latter days\" and \"latter end\" in Numbers 24:14, 20. It means the last state of a people or of a man as represented in his offspring; the sense is not incorrectly expressed by the Septuagint, γένοιτο τὸ σπέρμα μου ὡς τὸ σπέρμα τούτων.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Come... unto another place. Balak attributed the miscarriage of his enterprise thus far to something inauspicious in the locality. Thou shalt see but the utmost part of them. אֶפֶס קָצֶהוּ תִרְאֶה. Both the meaning of the nouns and the tense of the verb are disputed. By some \"e ephes katsehu\" (the end of the last of them) is held equivalent to \"the whole of them,\" which seems to contradict the next clause even if defensible in itself. The ordinary rendering is favoured by the Septuagint (ἀλλ η} μέρος τι αὐτοῦ ὄψει) and by the Targums. On the other hand, some would read the verb in the present tense, and understand Balak's words to refer to the place they were leaving. This is in accordance with the statement in Numbers 22:41, and it would certainly seem as if Balak and Balaam moved each time nearer to that encampment which was for different masons the center of attraction to them both.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The field of Zophim, i.e., of the watchers. Probably a well-known outlook. To the top of Pisgah. They followed apparently on the track of their enemies (see on Numbers 21:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - While I meet the Lord yonder. Rather, \"and I will go and meet thus.\" וְאָנֹכִי אִקָּרֶה כֹּה. Balaam does not say whom or what he is going to meet, but from the use of the same term in chapter 24. I it is evident that he employed the language of soothsayers looking for auguries. He may have spoken vaguely on purpose, because he was in truth acting a part with Balak.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I have received commandment to bless. The word \"commandment \"is not wanted here. Balaam had received, not instructions, but an inward revelation of the Divine will which he could not contravene.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob. The subject of this and the parallel clause is left indefinite. If it is God, according to the A.V., then it means that God in his mercy shut his eyes to the evil which did exist in individuals, and for his own sake would not impute it to the chosen nation. If it be impersonal, according to the Septuagint and the Targums, \"one does not behold iniquity,\" &c., then it means that the iniquity was not flagrant, was not left to gather head and volume until it brought down destruction. Perverseness. Rather, \"suffering\" (עָמָל. Septuagint, πόνος), the natural consequence of sin. Compare the use of the two words in Psalm 10:7; Psalm 90:10. The shout of a king is among them. The \"shout\" (תִּרוּעָה) is the jubilation of the nation with which it acclaims its victor king (cf. 1 Samuel 4:5, 6). In Leviticus 23:24; Psalm 47:5 it is used of the sounding of the sacred trumpets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - God. אֵל, and also at the end of the next verse, and four times in the next chapter (verses 4, 8, 16, 23). The use seems to be poetic, and no particular signification can be attached to it. Brought them, or, perhaps, \"is leading them.\" So the Septuagint: Θεὸς ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν αὐτόν. Unicorn. Hebrew, רְאֵם. It is uniformly rendered μονοκέρως by the Septuagint, under the mistaken notion that the rhinoceros was intended. It is evident, however, from Deuteronomy 33:17 and other passages that the teem had two hems, and that its horns were its most prominent feature. It would also appear from Job 39:9-12 and Isaiah 34:7 that, while itself untameable, it was allied to species employed in husbandry. The reem may therefore have been the aurochs or urus, now extinct, but which formerly had so large a range in the forests of the old world. There is some doubt, however, whether the urns existed in those days in Syria, and it may have been a wild buffalo, or some kindred animal of the bovine genus, whose size, fierceness, and length of horn made it a wonder and a fear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Enchantment, נָחַשׁ. Rather, \"augury.\" Septuagint, οἰωνισμός. See on Leviticus 19:26, where the practice is forbidden to Israel. Against Jacob, or, \"in Jacob,\" as the marginal reading, and this is favoured by the Septuagint and the Targums, and is equally true and striking. It was the proud peculiarity of Israel that he trusted not to any magic arts or superstitious rites, uncertain in themselves, and always leading to imposture, but to the direction and favour of the Almighty. Divination. קֶסֶם. Septuagint, μαντεία. The art of the soothsayer. According to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel. Rather, \"in season,\" i.e., in God's good time, \"it shall be said to Jacob and to Israel. What hath God wrought! or, \"what God doeth.\" The meaning seems to be that augury and divination were useless and vain in the case of Israel, because God himself declared and would declare his mighty acts in behalf of his people, and that by no uncertain vaticination, but by open declaration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - As a great lion. לָבִיא, generally translated \"old lion,\" as in Genesis 49:9. By some it is rendered lioness (cf. Job 4:11; Nahum 2:12). As a young lion. אַרִי, the ordinary term for a lion without further distinction. It is altogether fantastic to suppose that Balaam had just seen a lieu coming up from the ghor of Jordan, and that this \"omen\" inspired his \"mashal.\" The rising of a lion from its covert was one of the most common of the more striking phenomena of nature in those regions, and the imagery it afforded was in constant use; but in truth it is evident that these similes are borrowed from Jacob's dying prophecy concerning Judah (Genesis 49:9), in which the word \"prey\" (Hebrew, טֶרֶפ, a torn thing) is also found. Balaam was acquainted with that prophecy, as he was with the promises made to Abraham (cf. verse 10 with Genesis 13:16; Genesis 28:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I will bring thee unto another place. At first (verse 25) Balak had in his vexation desired to stop the mouth of Balaam, but afterwards he thought it wiser to make yet another attempt to change the mind of God; as a heathen, he still thought that this might be done by dint of importunity and renewed sacrifices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Unto the top of Peer. On the meaning of Peer see on chapter Numbers 25:3. This Peer was a summit of the Abarim ranges northwards from Pisgah, and nearer to the Israelites. The adjacent village, Beth-Peer, was near the place of Moses' burial (Deuteronomy 34:6). From the phrase used in Deuteronomy 3:29; Deuteronomy 4:46, with which the testimony of Eusebius agrees, it must have lain almost opposite Jericho on the heights behind the Arboth Moab. From Peer, therefore, the whole encampment, in all its length and breadth, would lie beneath their gaze. Jeshi-men. See on Numbers 21:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEChapter 24:1. - As at other times, or, \"as (he had done) time after time.\" Septuagint, κατὰ τὸ εἰωθός. To seek for enchantments. Rather, \"for the meeting with aunties.\" לִקְםראת נְחַשִׁים. Septuagint, to συνάντησιν τοῖς οἰωνοῖς. Nachashim., as in Numbers 23:23, is not enchantments in the sense of magical practices, but definitely auguries, i.e. omens and signs in the natural world observed and interpreted according to an artificial system as manifesting the purposes of God. As one of the commonest and worst of heathen practices, it was forbidden to Israel (Leviticus 19:26; Deuteronomy 18:10) and held up to reprobation, as in 2 Kings 17:17; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chronicles 33:6. Toward the wilderness. הַמִּדְבָּר. Not \"Jeshimon,\" but apparently the Arboth Moab in which Israel was encamped, and which were for the most part desert as compared with the country around.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The spirit of God came upon him. This seems to intimate a higher state of inspiration than the expression, \"God put a word into his mouth\" (Numbers 23:5, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Balaam... hath said. Rather, \"the utterance of Balaam.\" נְאֻם is constantly used, as in Numbers 14:28, for a Divine utterance, effatum Dei, but it does not by itself, apart from the context, claim a superhuman origin. The man whose eyes are open. הַגֶּבֶר שְׁתֻם הָעָיִן. The authorities are divided between the rendering in the text and the opposite rendering given in the margin. סָתַם is used in Daniel 8:26, and שָׂתָם in Lamentations 3:8, in the sense of \"shut;\" but, on the other hand, a passage in the Mishnah distinctly uses שׁתם and סתם in opposite senses. The Vulgate, on the one hand, has obturatus; the Septuagint, on the other, has ὁ ἀληθινῶς ὁρῶν, and this is the sense given by the Targums. Strange to say, it makes no real difference whether we read \"open\" or \"shut,\" because in any case it was the inward vision that was quickened, while the outward senses were closed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Falling into a trance. Rather, \"falling down.\" Qui cadit, Vulgate. The case of Saul, who \"fell down naked all that day\" (1 Samuel 19:24), overcome by the illapse of the Spirit, affords the best comparison. Physically, it would seem to have been a kind of catalepsy, in which the senses were closed to outward things, and the eyes open but unseeing. The word for \"open\" in this verse is the ordinary one, not that used in verse 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - As the valleys, or, \"as the torrents\" (נְחָלִים), which pour down in parallel courses from the upper slopes. As gardens by the river's side. The river (נָהָר), as in Numbers 22:5) means the Euphrates. Balaam combines the pleasant imagery of his own cultivated land with that of the wilder scene amidst which he now stood. As the trees of lign aloes. אָהָלִים. Aloe trees, such as grew in the further east, where Balaam had perhaps seen them. Which the Lord hath planted, or, \"the Lord's planting,\" a poetical way of describing their beauty and rarity (cf. Psalm 1:3; Psalm 104:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He shall pour the water, or, \"the water shall overflow.\" Out of his buckets. דָּלְיָו is the dual, \"his two buckets.\" The image, familiar enough to one who lived in an irrigated land, is of one carrying two buckets on the ends of a pole which are so full as to run over as he goes. And his seed... in many waters. It is uncertain in what sense the word \"seed\" issued. It may be an image as simple as the last, of seed sown either by or actually upon many waters (cf. Ecclesiastes 11:1), and so securing a plentiful and safe return; or it may stand for the seed, i.e., the posterity, of Israel, which should grow up amidst many blessings (Isaiah 44:4). The former seems most in keeping here. His king shall be higher than Agag. Rather, \"let his king be higher than Agag.\" The name Agag (אַגַג, the fiery one) does not occur again except as the name of the king of Amalek whom Saul conquered and Samuel slew (1 Samuel 15.); yet it may safely be assumed that it was the official title of all the kings of Amalek, resembling in this \"Abimelech\" and \"Pharaoh.\" Here it seems to stand for the dynasty and the nation of the Amalekites, and there is no reason to suppose that any reference was intended to any particular individual or event in the distant future. The \"king\" of Israel here spoken of is certainly not Saul or any other of the kings, but God himself in his character as temporal Ruler of Israel; and the \"kingdom\" is the kingdom of heaven as set forth by way of anticipation in the polity and order of the chosen race. As a fact, Israel had afterwards a visible king who overthrew Agag, but their having such a king was alien to the mind of God, and due to a distinct falling away from national faith, and therefore could find no place in this prophecy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And shall break their bones. יְגָרֵם (cf. Ezekiel 23:34) seems to mean \"crush\" or \"smash.\" The Septuagint has ἐκμυελιε1FC0;ι, \"shall suck out,\" i.e., the marrow, but the word does not seem to bear this meaning. Pierce them through with his arrows, or, \"dash in pieces his arrows,\" i.e., the arrows shot at him. חִצָּיו יְמִחָצ. The difficulty is the possessive suffix to \"arrows,\" which is in the singular; otherwise this rendering gives a much better sense, and more in keeping with the rest of the passage The image in Balaam's mind is evidently that of a terrible wild beast devouring his enemies, stamping them underfoot, and dashing to pieces in his fury the arrows or darts which they vainly launch against him (compare the imagery in Daniel 7:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A lion. אַרִי. A great lion. לָבִיא. See on Numbers 23:24, and Genesis 49:9. Blessed is he that blesseth thee, &c. In these words Balaam seems to refer to the terms of Balak's first message (Numbers 22:6). Far from being affected by blessings and cursings from without, Israel was itself a source of blessing or cursing to others according as they treated him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Spake I not also. This was altogether true. Balaam had enough of the true prophet about him not only to act with strict fidelity, as far as the letter of the command went, but also to behave with great dignity towards Balak.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I will advertise thee. אִיעָצְך has properly the meaning \"advise\" (Septuagint, συμβουλεύσω), but it seems to have here the same subordinate sense of giving information which \"advise\" has with us. The Vulgate here has followed the surmise of the Jewish commentators, who saw nothing in Balaam but the arch-enemy of their race, and has actually altered the text into \"dabo consilium quid populus tuus populo huic faciat\" (cf. Numbers 31:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Knew the knowledge of the Most High. Septuagint, ἐπιστάμενος ἐπιστήμην παρὰ Υψίστου. This expression alone distinguishes this introduction of Balaam's mashal from the former one (verses 3, 4), but it is difficult to say that it really adds anything to our understanding of his mental state. If we ask when Balaam had received the revelation which he now proceeds to communicate, it would seem most natural to reply that it was made known to him when \"the Spirit of God came upon him,\" and that Balak's anger had interrupted him in the midst of his mashal, or possibly he had kept it back, as too distasteful to his patron, until he saw that he had nothing more to expect from that quarter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh. Rather, \"I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not near\" (אַשׁוּרֶנּוּ...אֶראֶנוּ exactly as in Numbers 23:9). Balaam does not mean to say that he expected himself to see at any future time the mysterious Being of whom he speaks, who is identical with the \"Star\" and the \"Scepter\" of the following clauses; he speaks wholly as a prophet, and means that his inner gaze is fixed upon such an one, with full assurance that he exists in the counsels of God, but with clear recognition of the fact that his actual coming is yet in the far future. There shall come a Star out of Jacob. Septuagint, ἀνατελεῖ ἀστρον. It may quite as well be rendered by the present; Balaam simply utters what passes before his inward vision. The star is a natural and common poetic symbol of an illustrious, or, as we say, \"brilliant,\" personage, and as such recurs many times in Scripture (cf. Job 38:7; Isaiah 14:12; Daniel 8:10; Matthew 24:29; Philippians 2:15; Revelation 1:20; Revelation 2:28). The celebrated Jewish fanatic called himself Barcochab, \"son of the Star,\" in allusion to this prophecy. A Scepter shall rise out of Israel. This further defines the \"star ' as a ruler of men, for the scepter is Used in that sense in the dying prophecy of Jacob (Genesis 49:10), with which Balaam was evidently acquainted. Accordingly the Septuagint has here ἀναστήσεται. Shall smite the corners of Moab. Rather, \"the two corners\" (dual), or \"the two sides of Moab,\" i.e., shall crush Moab on either side. And destroy all the children of Sheth. In Jeremiah 48:45, where this prophecy is in a manner quoted, the word קַרְקַר (qarqar, destroy) is altered into קָדקֹר (quadqod, crown of the head). This raises a very curious and interesting question as to the use made by the prophets of the earlier Scriptures, but it gives no authority for an alteration of the text. The expression בְּנֵי־שֵׁת has been variously rendered. The Jewish commentators, followed by the Septuagint (πάντας υἱοὺς Σήθ) and the older versions, understand it to mean the sons of Seth, the son of Adam, i.e., all mankind. Many modern commentators, however, take שֵׁת as a contraction of שֵׁאת (Lamentations 3:47 - \"desolation\"), and read \"sons of confusion,\" as equivalent to the unruly neighbours and relations of Israel. This, however, is extremely dubious in itself, for שֵׁת nowhere occurs in this sense, and derives no sup. port from Jeremiah 48:45. It is true that בְּנֵי שֵׁת is there replaced by בְּנֵי שָׁאון, \"sons of tumult,\" but then this very verse affords the clearest evidence that the prophet felt no hesitation in altering the text of Scripture to suit his own inspired purpose. If it be true that קַרְקַר will not bear the meaning given to it in the Targums of \"reign over,\" still there is no insuperable difficulty in the common rendering. Jewish prophecy, from beginning to end, contemplated the Messiah as the Conqueror, the Subduer, and even the Destroyer of all the heathen, i.e., of all who were not Jews. It is only in the New Testament that the iron scepter with which he was to dash in pieces the heathen (Psalm 2:9) becomes the pastoral staff wherewith he shepherds them (Revelation 2:27 - ποιμανεῖ after the Septuagint, which has here misread the text). The prophecy was that Messiah should destroy the heathen; the fulfillment that he destroyed not them, but their heathenism (cf. e.g., Psalm 149:6-9 with James 5:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies. Seir (Genesis 32:3), or Mount Seir (Genesis 36:8), was the old name, still retained as an alternative, of Edom. It is uncertain whether the rendering \"for his (i.e., Edom's) enemies\" is correct. The Hebrew is simply אֹיְבָיו, which may stand in apposition to Edom and Seir, \"his enemies,\" i.e., the enemies of Israel. So the Septuagint, Ησαῦ ὁ ἐχθρὸς αὐτοῦ.

This looking must have been an inward vision, because the haunts of the Amalekites were far away (see on Genesis 36:12; Exodus 17:8; Numbers 14:25, 45). The first of the nations. Amalek was in no sense a leading nation, nor was it a very ancient nation. It was indeed the very first of the nations to attack Israel, but it is a most arbitrary treatment of the words to understand them in that sense. The prophet Amos (Amos 6:1) uses the same expression of the Jewish aristocracy of his day. As it was in no better position than Amalek to claim it in any true sense, we can but suppose that in either case there is a reference to the vainglorious vauntings of the people threatened; it would be quite in keeping with the Bedawin character if Amalek gave himself out be \"the first of nations.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He looked on the Kenites. This mashal is excessively obscure, for both the subject of it and the drift of it are disputed. On the one hand, the Kenites are mentioned among the Canaanitish tribes that were to be dispossessed, in Gem 15:19; on the other, they are identified with the Midianitish tribe to which Hobab and Raguel belonged, in Judges 1:16, and apparently in 1 Samuel 15:6 (see on Numbers 10:29). It has been supposed that the friendly Kenites had by this time loft the camp of Israel and established themselves by conquest in the south of Canaan, and even that they had occupied the territory and taken the name of the original Kenites of Genesis 15:19. This, however, is a mere conjecture, and a very improbable one. That a weak tribe like that of Hobab should have done what Israel had not dared to do, and settled themselves by force of arms in Southern Palestine, and, further, that they should be already known by the name of those whom they had destroyed, is extremely unlikely, and is inconsistent with the statement in Judges 1:16. And thou puttest thy nest in a rock. Rather, \"and thy nest laid (שִׂים) upon a rock.\" We do not know where the Kenites dwelt, and therefore we cannot tell whether this expression is to be understood literally or figuratively. If the Canaanitish tribe is here spoken of, it is very likely they had their residence in some strong mountain fastness, but if the Midianitish tribe, then there is no reason to suppose that they had crossed the Jordan at all In that case the \"nest\" must be wholly figurative, and must refer to that strong confidence which they placed in the protection of the God of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted. כִּי אִם־יִהְיֶה לְבָעֵר קָיִן. Rather, \"Kain shall surely not be wasted.\" כִּי־אִם is of doubtful meaning, but it seems here to have the force of a negative question equivalent to a negation. Kain is mentioned in Joshua 15:57 as one of the towns of Judah, but there is little reason to suppose that an insignificant village is here mentioned by name. Probably \"Kain\" stands for the tribe-father, and is simply the poetical equivalent of Kenite. Until עַד־מָה. There is some uncertainty about these two particles, which are sometimes rendered \"how long?\" In the sense of \"until\" they are said to be an Aramaism, but this is doubtful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - When God doeth this.

This exclamation refers to the woe which he is about to pronounce, which involved his own people also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Chittim. Cyprus (see on Genesis 10:4). The \"isles of Chittim are mentioned by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 2:10) and by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:6) in the sense apparently of the western islands generally while in Daniel 11:30 \"the ships of Chittim, may have an even wider reference. Indeed the Targum of Palestine makes mention of Italy here, and the Vulgate actually translates \"venient in trieribus de Italia.\" There is, however, no reason to suppose that Balaam knew or spoke of anything further than Cyprus. It was \"from the side of\" (מִיַּד) Cyprus that the ships of his vision came down upon the Phoenician coasts, wherever their original starting-point may have been. Shall afflict, or, \"shall bring low.\" The same word is used of the oppression of Israel in Egypt (Genesis 15:13). Eber. The Septuagint has here 'Αβραίους, and is followed by the Peschito and the Vulgate. It is not likely, however, that Balaam would have substituted \"Eber\" for the \"Jacob\" and \"Israel\" which he had previously used. The Targum of Onkelos paraphrases \"Eber\" by \"beyond the Euphrates,\" and that of Palestine has \"all the sons of Eber.\" From Gem 10:21 it would appear that \"the children of Eber\" were the same as the Shemites; Asshur, therefore, was himself included in Eber, but is separately mentioned on account of his fame and power. And he also shall perish forever. The subject of this prophecy is left in obscurity. It is difficult on grammatical grounds to refer it to Asshur, and it does not seem appropriate to \"Eber.\" It may mean that the unnamed conquering race which should overthrow the Asian monarchies should itself come to an end for evermore; or it may be that Balaam added these words while he beheld with dismay the coming destruction of his own Shemitic race, and their final subjugation by more warlike powers. It must be remembered that the Greek empire, although overthrown, did not by any means \"perish for ever\" in the same sense as the previous empires of the East.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And returned to his place. יָשֹׁב לִמְקֹ ו. It is doubtful whether this expression, which is used in Genesis 18:33 and in other places, implies that Balaam returned to his home on the Euphrates. If he did he must have retraced his steps almost immediately, because he was slain among the Midianites shortly after (chapter 31:8). The phrase, however, may merely mean that he set off homewards, and is not inconsistent with the supposition that he went no further on his way than the headquarters of the Midianites. It is not difficult to understand the infatuation which would keep him within reach of a people so strange and terrible. NOTE ON THE PROPHECIES OF BALAAM. That the prophecies of Balaam have a Messianic character, and are only to be fully understood in a Christian sense, seems to lie upon the face of them. The Targums of Onkelos and Palestine make mention of King Meshiba here, and the great mass of Christian interpretation has uniformly followed in the track of Jewish tradition. It is of course possible to get rid of the prophetic element altogether by assuming that the utterances of Balaam were either composed or largely interpolated after the events to which they seem to refer. It would be necessary in this case to bring their real date down to the period of the Macedonian conquests, and much later still if the Greek empire also was to \"perish for ever.\" The difficulty and arbitrary character of such an assumption becomes the more evident the more it is considered; nor does it seem consistent with the form into which the predictions are cast. A patriotic Jew looking back from the days of Alexander or his successors would not call the great Eastern power by the name of Asshur, because two subsequent empires had arisen in the place of Assyria proper. But that Balaam, looking forward down the dim vista of the future, should see Asshur, and only Asshur, is in perfect keeping with what we know of prophetic perspective, - the further off the events descried by inward vision, the more extreme the foreshortening, - according to which law it is well known that the first and second advents of Christ are inextricably blended in almost every case. If we accept the prophecies as genuine, it is, again, only possible to reject the Messianic element by assuming that no Jewish prophecy overleaps the narrow limits of Jewish history. The mysterious Being whom Balaam descries in the undated future, who is the King of Israel, and whom he identifies with the Shiloh of Jacob's dying prophecy, and who is to bring to nought all nations of the world, cannot be David, although David may anticipate him in many ways; still less, as the reference to Agag, Amalek, and the Kenites might for a moment incline us to believe, can it be Saul. At the same time, while the Messianic element in the prophecy cannot reasonably be ignored, it is obvious that it does not by any means exist by itself; it is so mixed up with what is purely local and temporal in the relations between Israel and the petty tribes which surrounded and envied him, that it is impossible to isolate it or to exhibit it in any clear and definite form. The Messiah indeed appears, as it were, upon the stage in a mysterious and remote grandeur; but he appears with a slaughter weapon in his hand, crushing such enemies of Israel as were then and there formidable, and exterminating the very fugitives from the overthrow. Even where the vision loses for once its local colouring in one way, so that the King of Israel deals with all the sons of men, yet it retains it in another, for he deals with them in wrath and destruction, not in love and blessing. There is here so little akin to the true ideal, that we are readily tempted to say that Christ is not here at all, but only Saul or David, or the Jewish monarchy personified in the ruthlessness of its consolidated power. But if we know anything of the genius of prophecy, it is exactly this, that the future and the grand and the heavenly is seen through a medium of the present and the paltry and the earthly. The Messianic element almost always occurs in connection with some crisis in the outward history of the chosen people; it is inextricably mixed up with what is purely local in interest, and often with what is distinctly imperfect in morality. To the Jew - and to Balaam also, however unwillingly, as the servant of Jehovah - the cause of Israel was the cause of God; he could not discern between them. \"Our country, right or wrong,\" was an impossible sentiment to him, because he could not conceive of his country being wrong; he knew nothing of moral victories, or the triumphs of defeat or of suffering; he could not think of God's kingdom as asserting itself in any other way than in the overthrow, or (better still) the annihilation, of Moab, Edom, Assyria, Babylon, Rome, the whole world which was not Israel. The sufferings of the vanquished, the horrors of sacked cities, the agonies of desolated homes, were nothing to him; nothing, unless it were joy - joy that the kingdom of God should be exalted in the earth, joy that the reign of wickedness should be broken. All these feelings belonged to a most imperfect morality and we rightly look upon them with horror, because we have (albeit as yet very imperfectly) conformed our sentiments to a higher standard. But it was the very condition of the old dispensation that God adopted the then moral code, such as it was, and hallowed it with religious sanctions, and gave it a strong direction God-ward, and so educated his own for something higher. Hence it is wholly natural and consistent to find this early vision of the Messiah, the heaven-sent King of Israel, introduced in connection with the fall of the petty pastoral state of Moab. To Balaam, standing where he did in time and place, and all the more because his personal desires went with Moab as against Israel, Moab stood forth as the representative kingdom of darkness, Israel as the kingdom of light, Through that strong, definite, narrow, and essentially imperfect, but not untrue, conviction of his he saw the Messiah, and he saw him crushing Moab first, and then trampling down all the rest of a hostile world. That no one would have been more utterly astonished if he had beheld the Messiah as he was, is certain; but that is not at all inconsistent with the belief that he really prophesied concerning him. That he should put all enemies under his feet was what Balaam truly saw; but he saw it and gave utterance to it according to the ideas and imagery of which his mind was full. God ever reveals the supernatural through the natural, the heavenly through the earthly, the future through the present. It remains to consider briefly the temporal fulfillments of Balaam's prophecies. Moab was not apparently seriously attacked until the time of David, when it was vanquished, and a great part of the inhabitants slaughtered (2 Samuel 8:2). In the division of the kingdom it fell to the share of Israel, with the other lands beyond Jordan, but the vicissitudes of the northern monarchy gave it opportunities to rebel, of which it successfully availed itself after the death of Ahab (2 Kings 1:1). Only in the time of John Hyrcanus ( B.C. 129) was it finally subdued, and ceased to have an independent existence. Edom was also conquered for the first time by David, and the people as far as possible exterminated (1 Kings 11:15, 16). Nevertheless, it was able to shake off the yoke under Joram (2 Kings 8:20), and, although defeated, was never again subdued (see on Genesis 27:40). The prophecies against Edom were indeed taken up again and again by the prophets (e.g., Obadiah), but we must hold that they were never adequately fulfilled, unless we look for a spiritual realization not in wrath, but in mercy. The later Jews themselves came to regard \"Edom\" as a Scriptural synonym for all who hated and oppressed them. Amalek was very thoroughly overthrown by Saul, acting under the directions of Samuel (1 Samuel 15:7, 8), and never appears to have regained any national existence. Certain bands of Amalekites were smitten by David, and others at a later period in the reign of Hezekiah by the men of Simeon (1 Chronicles 4:39-43). The prophecy concerning the Kenites presents, as noted above, great difficulty, because it is impossible to know certainly whether the older Kenites of Genesis or the later Kenites of 1 Samuel are intended. In either case, however, it must be acknowledged that sacred history throws no light whatever on the fulfillment of the prophecy; we know nothing at all as to the fate of this small clan. No doubt it ultimately shared the lot of all the inhabitants of Palestine, with the exception of Judah and Jerusalem, and was transplanted by one of the Assyrian generals to some far-off spot, where its very existence as a separate people was lost. The \"ships from the side of Cyprus\" clearly enough represent in the vision of Balaam invaders from over the western seas, as opposed to previous conquerors from over the eastern deserts and mountains. That the invasion of Alexander the Great was not actually made by the way of Cyprus is nothing to the point. It was never any part of spiritual illumination to extend geographical knowledge. To Balaam's mind the only open way from the remote and unknown western lands was the waterway by the sides of Cyprus, and accordingly he saw the hostile fleets gliding down beneath the lee of those sheltering coasts towards the harbours of Phoenicia. Doubtless the ships which Balaam saw were rigged as ships were rigged in Balaam's time, and not as in the time of Alexander. But the rigging, like the route, belonged to the local and personal medium through which the prophecy came, not to the prophecy itself. As a fact it remains true that a maritime power from the West, whose home was beyond Cyprus, did overwhelm the older power which stood in the place and inherited the empire of Assyria. Whether the subsequent ruin of this maritime power also is part of the prophecy must remain doubtful.NEWLINENEWLINE","Num.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Abode in Shittim. For a considerable time; from their first arrival in the Arboth Moab until the crossing of the Jordan. Shittim is the shortened form of Abel-Shittim, \"Field of Acacias\" (Numbers 33:49). It seems to have been the northernmost part of the last encampment of Israel on that side Jordan, and the head-quarters of the host (Joshua 2:1; Joshua 3:1). Began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. This commencement of sin seems to have been made by Israel without special provocation.

This is a technical phrase, repeated in verse 5, and quoted in Psalm 106:28, expressing the quasi-sacramental union into which they entered with the heathen deity by partaking of his sacrificial meats and by sharing in his impure rites (cf. Hosea 9:10 and the argument of St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 10). There can be little doubt that Peor (פְּעור, from פָעַר, to open) has the sense of aperiens, in usu obsceno, and that it was the distinguishing name of Baal or Chemosh when worshipped as the god of reproduction with the abominable rites proper to this cultus. For a notice of the same thing in the last days of Israel see Hosea 4:14, and for the practice of Babylonian and (to some degree) Egyptian women, see Herodotus, 1:199; 2:60). The Septuagint has here ἐτελέσθη τῷ Βεελφεγώρ, \"was consecrated,\" or \"initiated,\" unto Baal-Peor, which admirably expressed the sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord said unto Moses. It seems strange that so fearful an apostasy had gone so far without interference on the part of Moses. He may have been absent from the camp on account of the wars with the Amorite kings; or he may have trusted to the chiefs to see that due order and discipline was maintained in the camps. Take all the heads of the people, i.e., the chiefs, who ought to have prevented, and might have prevented, this monstrous irregularity, but who seem, if we may judge from the case of Zimri, to have countenanced it. The mere neglect of duty in so gross a case was reason enough for summary execution. Hang them up before the Lord. Either by way of impalement or by way of crucifixion, both of which were familiar modes of punishment. In this case the guilty persons were probably slain first, and exposed afterwards. The hanging up was not ordered on account of its cruelty, nor merely for the sake of publicity (\"against the sun ), but in order to show that the victims were devoted to the wrath of God against sin (cf. Deuteronomy 21:23; 2 Samuel 21:2-6). The Septuagint has here παραδειγμάτισον αὐτούς. Cf. Hebrews 6:6, where this word is coupled with \"crucify.\" Them is no authority for referring the \"them\" (אותָם) to the guilty persons instead of to the heads of the people, as is done by the Targums and by many commentators.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The judges of Israel. אֶלאּשֹׁפְטֵי.

Deuteronomy 1:16; Judges 2:16), but the verb is freely used in Exodus 18, in describing the functions of the officers appointed at Sinai. Every one his men. The men who were under his particular jurisdiction. This command given by Moses is not to be confounded with the previous command given to Moses to hang up all the chiefs. Moses only could deal with the chief, but it was within the power and the province of the judges to deal with ordinary offenders. It does not, however, appear how far either of these commands was put in practice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A Midianitish woman. Rather, \"the Midianitish woman.\" אֶת־הַמִּדְיָנִית. Septuagint, τὴν Μαδιανίτην. The writer deals with an incident only too notorious, and which by the peculiar aggravation of its circumstances had fixed itself deeply in the popular memory. This is the first mention of the Midianites in connection with this affair, and it prepares us to learn without surprise that they were in reality the authors of this mischief. All the congregation,... who were weeping. According to the loose sense in which this expression is used throughout the Pentateuch, it evidently means that those who truly represented the nation, not only as a political, but also as a religions community, were gathered in this distress before the presence of their invisible King. They wept on account of the wrath of God provoked; probably also on account of the wrath of God already gone forth in the form of a pestilence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Phinehas, the son of Eleazar.

The word signifies an arched recess (cf. the Arabic \"alcove,\" from the same root, and the Latin fornix), and means probably the inner division which served as the women's room in the larger tents of the wealthier Israelites. There is no sufficient ground for supposing that a special place had been erected for this evil purpose; if it had been, it would surely have been destroyed. Through her belly. אֶל־קָבָתָהּ. Septuagint, διὰ τῆς μήτρας αὐτῆς. So the plague was stayed. No plague has been mentioned, but the narrative evidently deals with an episode the details of which were very fresh in the memory of all, and is extremely concise. That a plague would follow such an apostasy might be certainly expected from the previous experiences at Kibroth-hattaavah, at Kadesh, and after the rebellion of Korah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Were twenty and four thousand. \"Fell in one day three and twenty thousand,\" says St. Paul (1 Corinthians 10:8). As the Septuagint does not deviate here from the Hebrew, the Apostle must have followed some Rabbinical tradition. It is possible enough that the odd thousand died on some other day than the one of which he speaks, or they may have died by the hands of the judges, and not by the plague.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord spake unto Moses, saying.

These details as to names seem to have been added as an after-thought, for they would naturally have been given in verse 11, where the man and the woman are first mentioned. The woman's name is given again in verse 18, as if for the first time. We may probably conclude that verses 14, 15 were inserted into the narrative either by the hand of Moses himself at a later date, or possibly by some subsequent hand. Zimri. This was not an uncommon name, but the individual who bears it here is not elsewhere mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian. Rather, \"head of tribes (אֻמּות, for the use of which cf. Genesis 25:16) of a father's house in Midian.\" It seems to mean that several clans descended from one tribe-father looked up to Zur as their head. In Numbers 31:8 he is called one of the five \"kings\" of Midian. That the daughter of such a man should have been selected, and should have been willing, to play such a part throws a strong light upon the studied character and the peculiar danger of the seduction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVex the Midianites, and smite them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Vex the Midianites. The Moabites, although the evil began with them, were passed over; perhaps because they were still protected by the Divine injunction (Deuteronomy 2:9) not to meddle with them; more probably because their sin had not the same studied and deliberate character as the sin of the Midianites. We may think of the women of Moab as merely indulging their individual passions after their wonted manner, but of the women of Midian as employed by their rulers, on the advice of Balsam, in a deliberate plot to entangle the Israelites in heathen rites and heathen sins which would alienate from them the favour of God. NOTE ON THE ZEAL OF PHINEHAS. The act of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, in slaying Zimri and Cozbi is one of the most memorable in the Old Testament; not so much, however, in itself, as in the commendation bestowed upon it by God. It is unquestionably surprising at first sight that an act of unauthorized zeal, which might so readily be made (as indeed it was made) the excuse for deeds of murderous fanaticism, should be commended in the strongest terms by the Almighty; that an act of summary vengeance, which we find it somewhat hard to justify on moral grounds, should be made in a peculiar sense and in a special degree the pattern of the great atonement wrought by the Saviour of mankind; but this aspect of the deed in the eyes of God by its very unexpectedness draws our attention to it, and obliges us to consider wherein its distinctive religious character and excellence lay. It is necessary in the first place to point out that the act of Phinehas did really receive stronger testimony from God than any other act done proprio motu in the Old Testament. What he did was not done officially (for he held no office), nor was it clone by command (for the offenders were not under his jurisdiction as judge), nor in fulfillment of any revealed law or duty (for no blame would have attached to him if he had let it alone), and yet it had the same effect in staying the plague as the act of Aaron when he stood between the living and the dead with the hallowed fire in his hand (see on Numbers 16:46-48). Of both it is said that \"he made an atonement for the people,\" and so far they both appear as having power with God to turn away his wrath and stay his avenging hand. But the atonement made by Aaron was official, for he was the anointed high priest, and, being made with incense from the sanctuary, it was mate in accordance with and upon the strength of a ceremonial law laid down by God whereby he had bound himself to exercise his Divine right of pardon. The act of Phinehas, on the contrary, had no legal or ritual value; there is no power of atonement in the blood of sinners, nor had the death of 24,000 guilty people had any effect in turning away the wrath of God from them that survived. It remains, therefore, a startling truth that the deed of Phinehas is the only act neither official nor commanded, but originating in the impulses of the actor himself, to which the power of atoning for sin is ascribed in the Old Testament: for although in 2 Samuel 21:3 David speaks of making an atonement by giving up seven of Saul's sons, it is evident from the context that the \"atonement\" was made to the Gibeonites, and not directly to the Lord. Again, the act of Phinehas merited the highest reward from God, a reward which was promised to him in the most absolute terms. Because he had clone this thing he should have God's covenant of peace, he and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. This promise must mean that he and his seed should have power with God for ever to make peace between heaven and earth, and to make reconciliation for the sins of the people; and, meaning this, it is a republication in favour of Phinehas, and in more absolute terms, of the covenant made with Levi as represented by Aaron (see on Malachi 2:4, 5). Nor is this all. In Psalm 106:31 it is said of his deed that \"it was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore.\" This word \"counted\" or \"imputed\" is the same (חָשַׁב) which is used of Abraham in Genesis 15:6, and the very words of the Septuagint here (ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην) are applied to the obedience of Abraham in James 2:23. It appears then that righteousness was imputed to Phinehas, as to the father of the faithful, with this distinction, that to Phinehas it was imputed as an everlasting righteousness, which is not said of Abraham. Now if we compare the two, it must be evident that the act of Phinehas was not, like Abraham's, an act of self-sacrificing obedience, nor in any special sense an act of faith. While both acted under the sense of duty, the following of duty in Abraham's case put the greatest possible strain upon all the natural impulses of mind and heart; in the case of Phinehas it altogether coincided with the impulses of his own will. If faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness, it is clear that zeal was imputed to Phinehas for righteousness for evermore. This being so, it is necessary in the second place to point out that the act in question (like that of Abraham in sacrificing his son) was distinctly one of moral virtue according to the standard then Divinely allowed. An act which was in itself wrong, or of doubtful rectitude, could not form the ground for such praise and promise, even supposing that they really looked far beyond the act itself. Now it is clearNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that under no circumstances would a similar act be justifiable now;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that no precedent could be established by it then.NEWLINENEWLINEThe Jews indeed feigned a \"zealot-right,\" examples of which they saw (amongst others) in the act of Samuel slaying Agag (1 Samuel 15:33), of Mattathias slaying the idolatrous Jew and the king's commissioner (1 Macc. 2:24-26), of the Sanhedrim slaying St. Stephen. But the last-mentioned case is evidence enough that in the absence of distinct Divine guidance zeal is sure to degenerate into fanaticism, or rather that it is impossible to distinguish zeal from fanaticism. Every such act must of necessity stand upon its own merits, for it can only be justified by the coexistence of two conditions which are alike beyond human certainty:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the deed is itself in accordance with the will of God;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the doing of it is inspired by motives, absolutely pure.NEWLINENEWLINEThat Christ came to save men's lives, and that God would have all men to repent, has made for us the primary condition impossible, and therefore the act of Phinehas would be immoral now. No one may take life unless he has the mandate of the State for doing' so. But it was not so then; God was the King of Israel, and the foes of Israel were the foes of God, with whom there could be no peace or amity as long as they threatened the very existence of God's people and worship. The Israelite who indulged in sinful intercourse with a heathen was a rebel against his King and a traitor to his country; he became ipso facto an \"outlaw,\" to slay whom was the bounden duty of every true patriot. If it be said that this view of things belongs to an inferior code of morality, which ignored the universal brotherhood of men and Fatherhood of God, that is admitted at once. The elder revelation founded itself plainly and avowedly upon the moral law as then universally held (and by no means supplanted yet by the higher law of Christ), that men were to love their brethren and hate their enemies. To complain that the act of Phinehas was moral in a Jewish and not in a Christian sense is only to find fault with God for suffering a confessedly imperfect and preparatory morality to do its work until the fullness of time was come. While, therefore, we recognize the act of Phinehas as one determined, in its outward form, by the imperfect morality of the dispensation under which he lived, it is necessary to look below the act to the spirit which animated it for its permanent value and significance. That spirit is clearly defined by the testimony of God - \"while he was zealous with my zeal.\" The excellence of Phinehas was, that he was filled with a zeal which was itself Divine against sin, and that he acted fearlessly and promptly (whilst others apparently hesitated even when commanded) under the impulse of that zeal; in other words, what pleased God so greatly was to see his own hatred of sin, and his own desire to make it to cease, reflected in the mind and expressed in the deed of one who acted upon righteous impulse, not under any command or constraint. It is impossible, in the third place, not to see that this record throws a flood of light upon the doctrine of the atonement; for the act of Phinehas stands, in some respects, upon a higher level than all the types and shadows of the cross which had gone before; being neither an act of submission to a definite command, like the sacrifice of Isaac, nor a piece of ordered ritual, like the sending forth of the goat for Azazel; but a spontaneous deed, having a moral value of its own. Partly at least for the sake of what it was, not merely what it showed in a figure, it was accepted as an atonement for the sin of Israel (which was very gross), and was imputed to its author for an everlasting righteousness. Phinehas, therefore, in one very important sense, would seem to bear a stronger resemblance to our Lord in his atoning work than any other person in the Old Testament. It may therefore be submitted that we must seek the truest ground of the atonement wrought by Christ not in the simple fact of the passion and death of the God-man, nor in the greatness or value of his sufferings as such; but in that zeal for God, that Divine indignation against sin as the opposite of God, that consuming desire to cause it to cease, which first animated the life of the Redeemer, and then informed his death. Phinehas in his measure, and according to his lights, was governed by the same Spirit, and surrendered himself to the prompting of the same Spirit, by which Christ offered himself without spot unto God. And that Spirit was the Spirit of a consuming zeal, wherein our Lord hastened with an entire eagerness of purpose (Luke 12:50; John 2:17; John 12:27, 28, &c.) to \"condemn sin in the flesh\" and so to glorify God, and to accomplish the object of his mission (Romans 8:3), not by the summary execution of individual sinners, but after an infinitely higher fashion, by the sacrifice of himself as the representative of the whole sinful race. Lastly, it must be noted that as the act of Phinehas enables us, almost more than anything else, to enter into the nature of our Lord's atonement, so it is only in the light of that atonement that we can justify to ourselves either the strength of the Divine commendation accorded to Phinehas, or the vastness of the promises made to him. For the deed was after all an act of violence, and a dangerous precedent, humanly speaking; and, on the other hand, the covenant of peace given to him and to his seed, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, failed to give any peace at all, save in a very broken and partial manner, and did not even continue in the keeping of his family. As the house of Eleazar was the elder of the two descended from Aaron, it would have been only natural that the high priestly dignity should remain with its members; as a fact, however, it passed to the house of Ithamar from the days of Eli until Solomon, for political reasons, deposed Abiathar in favour of Zadok; and it was lost for ever with the final fall of Jerusalem. As in so many cases, therefore, we have to acknowledge that the act of Phinehas was accepted as an atonement for the sake of that truer atonement which (in a remarkable sense) it anticipated; and that the promises given to Phinehas were only partially intended and partially fulfilled for him, while the true and eternal fulfillment was reserved for him of whom Phinehas was a figure. To Christ, in whom was combined an entire zeal against sin and an entire love for the sinner, was indeed given God's covenant of peace and an everlasting priesthood.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - It came to pass after the plague. This plague was the last event which seriously diminished the numbers of the Israelites; perhaps it was the last event which diminished them at all, for it seems to be throughout implied that none died except through their own fault. It is often supposed that this plague carried off the last survivors of the generation condemned at Kadesh (see verse 64); but this is opposed to the statement in Deuteronomy 2:14, 15, and is essentially improbable. The victims of the plague would surely be those who had joined themselves to Baal-Peor; and these again would surely be the younger, not the older, men in Israel. It is part of the moral of the story that these offenders deprived themselves, not merely of a few remaining days, but of many years of happy rest which might have been theirs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take the sum of all the congregation. This was certainly not commanded with a view to the war against Midian, which was of no military importance, and was actually prosecuted with no more than 12,000 men (Numbers 31:5). A general command to \"vex the Midianites\" had indeed been given (Numbers 25:17) on the principle of just retribution (cf. 2 Thessalonians 1:6), but no attempt seems to have been made to act upon it until a more specific order was issued (Numbers 31:2). In any case the present mustering has to do with something far more important, viz., with the approaching settlement of the people in its own territory. This is clear from the instructions given in verses 52-56, and from the distribution of the tribes into families. From twenty years. See on chapter Numbers 1:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Spake with them, i.e., no doubt with the responsible chiefs, who must have assisted in this census, as in the previous one (chapter Numbers 1:4), although the fact is not mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Take the sum of the people. These words are not in the text, but axe borrowed from verse 2. Nothing is set down in the original but the brief instruction given to the census-takers - \"from twenty years old and upward, as on the former occasion.\" And the children of Israel which went forth out of the land of Egypt. This is the punctuation of the Targums and most of the versions. The Septuagint, however, detaches these words from the previous sentence and makes them a general heading for the catalogue which follows. It may be objected to this that the people now numbered did not come out of Egypt, a full half having been born in the wilderness, but see on Numbers 23:22; 24:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The children of Reuben.

The mustering according to families (מִשְׁפְחֹת - Septuagint, δῆμοι) was the distinguishing feature of this census, because it was preparatory to a territorial settlement in Canaan, in which the unity of the family should be preserved as well as the unity of the tribe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Pallu; Eliab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the sons of Pallu. This particular genealogy is added because of the special interest which attached to the fate of certain members of the family. The plural \"sons\" is to be explained here not from the fact (which has nothing to do with it) that several grandsons are afterwards mentioned, but from the fact that וּבְנֵי (\"and the sons\") was the conventional heading of a family list, and was written doom by the transcriber before he noticed that only one name followed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Swallowed them up together with Korah. יַתִּבְלַע אֹתָם וְאֶתאּקֹרַח. Septuagint, κατέπειν αὐτοὺς καὶ Κορέ. This distinct statement, which is not modified in the Targums, seems decisive as to the fate of Korah. If indeed it were quite certain from the detailed narrative in chapter 16 that Korah perished with his own company, and not with the Reubenites, then it might be deemed necessary to force this statement into accordance with that certainty; but it is nowhere stated, or even clearly implied, that he perished by fire, and therefore there is no excuse for doing violence to the obvious meaning of this verse. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up, we are told, at the same time that Korah's company were consumed by fire; that is a clear statement, and cannot be set aside by any supposed necessity for avenging the sacri1egious ambition of Korah by the element of fire. And they became a sign. The Hebrew נֵםproperly means a banner or ensign, and is unusual in this sense. It exactly corresponds, however, to the Greek σήμειον, and has no doubt the same secondary signification - a something made conspicuous in order to attract attention and enforce a warning (cf. chapter Numbers 16:30, 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding the children of Korah died not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The children of Korah died not. The confused nature of the narrative in chapter 16 is well exemplified by this statement; we should certainly have supposed from Numbers 16:32 that Korah's sons had perished with him, if we were not here told to the contrary. The sons of Korah are frequently mentioned among the Levites, and Samuel himself would seem to have been of them (see on 1 Chronicles 6:22, 28, 33-38, and titles to Psalm 42, 88, &c.); it is, however, slightly doubtful whether the Kohathite Korah of 1 Chronicles 6:22, the ancestor of Samuel, is the same as the Izharite Korah, the ancestor of Heman, in 1 Chronicles 6:38.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Simeon after their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites: of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites: of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The sons of Simeon. As in Genesis 46:10; Exodus 6:15, with the omission of Ohad, who may not have founded any family. In such cases it is no doubt possible that there were children, but that for some reason they failed to hold together, and became attached to other families. In 1 Chronicles 4:24 the sons of Simeon appear as Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul. In Genesis and Exodus the first appears as Jemuel. These minute variations are only important as showing that Divine inspiration did not preserve the sacred records from errors of transcription.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf Zerah, the family of the Zarhites: of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe children of Gad after their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites: of Haggi, the family of the Haggites: of Shuni, the family of the Shunites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The children of Gad.

The Beni-Judah, or \"men of Judah,\" according to their sub-tribal divisions, are clearly distinguished from the \"sons of Judah\" as individuals, two of whom are mentioned in the previous verse. Of the families of Judah, three were named after sons, two after grandsons. As the Pharzites remained a distinct family apart from the Hamulites and Hezronites, it may he supposed that Pharez had other sons not mentioned here, or in Genesis 46:12, or in 1 Chronicles 2:3, 4, 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Pharez were; of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Hamul, the family of the Hamulites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them, threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Issachar after their families: of Tola, the family of the Tolaites: of Pua, the family of the Punites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The sons of Issachar.

There is considerable difficulty about the families of this tribe, because they are not recorded in Genesis, while the details preserved in 1 Chronicles 7:14-17 are so obscure and fragmentary as to be extremely perplexing. According to the present enumeration there were eight families in Manasseh, one named after his son Machir, one after his grandson Gilead, and the rest after his great-grandsons. The list given in Joshua 17:1, 2 agrees with this, except that the Machirites and the Gileadites are apparently identified. It appears from the genealogy in 1 Chronicles 7 that the mother of Machir was a stranger from Aram, the country of Laban. This may perhaps account for the fact that Machir's son received the name of Gilead, for Gilead was the border land between Aram and Canaan; it more probably explains the subsequent allotment of territory in that direction to the Machirites (Numbers 32:40). Gilead appears again as a proper name in Judges 11:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Asriel, the family of the Asrielites: and of Shechem, the family of the Shechemites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites: and of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters: and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Zelophehad... had no sons, but daughters.

These formed but four families, three named after sons, one after a grandson. In 1 Chronicles 7:21 two other sons of Ephraim are mentioned who were killed in their father's lifetime, and a third, Beriah, who was the ancestor of Joshua. He does not seem to have founded a separate family, possibly because he was so very much younger than his brothers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred.

Them is still more divergence between these and the longer genealogies found in 1 Chronicles 7:6-12; 1 Chronicles 8:1-5 sq. It is possible that the family of Becher (Genesis), who had nine sons (1 Chronicles), went under another name, because there was a family of Becherites in Ephraim (verse 35); and similarly the family of the Ephraimite Beriah (1 Chronicles) may have ceded its name in favour of the Asherite family of Beriites (verse 44).

It has been proposed to explain this on the ground of their both being pastoral tribes; but if the members of these tribes were more scattered than the rest, it would be just in their case that we should expect to find round numbers. The one fact which these figures establish in a startling way is, that while the nation as a whole remained heady stationary in point of numbers, the various tribes show a most unexpected variation. Manasseh, e.g., has increased his population 63 per cent. in spite of the fact that there is not one man left of sixty years of age, while Simeon has decreased in the same proportion. There is indeed little difficulty in accounting for diminishing numbers amidst so many hardships, and after so many plagues. The fact that Zimri belonged to the tribe of Simeon, and that this tribe was omitted soon after from the blessing of Moses (Deuteronomy 33), may easily lead to the conclusion that Simeon was more than any other tribe involved in the sin of Baal-Peor and the punishment which followed. But when we compare, e. g., the twin tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, concerning whom nothing distinctive is either stated or hinted, whether bad or good; and when we find that the one has decreased 20 percent and the other increased 63 percent during the same interval, and under the same general circumstances, we cannot even guess at the causes which must have been at work to produce so striking a difference. It is evident that each tribe had its own history apart from the general history of the nation - a history which had the most important results for its own members, but of which we know almost nothing. It is observable, however, that all the tribes under the leadership of Judah increased, whilst all those in the camp of Reuben decreased.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - According to the number of the names. The intention clearly was that the extent of the territory assigned to each tribe, and called by its name (verse 55, b), should be regulated according to its numbers at the discretion of the rulers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot. This can only be reconciled with the preceding order by assuming that the lot was to determine the situation of the territory, the actual boundaries being left to the discretion of the rulers. Recourse was had as far as possible to the lot in order to refer the matter directly to God, of whose will and gift they held the land (cf. Proverbs 16:33; Acts 1:26). The lot would also remove any suspicion that the more numerous tribes, such as Judah or Dan, were unfairly favoured (verse 56).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of the Merarites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korathites. And Kohath begat Amram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - These are the families of the Levites. The three Levitical sub-tribes have been named in the preceding verse, and the present enumeration of families is an independent one. The Libnites were Gershonites (Numbers 3:21), the Hebronites and Korathites (or Korahites) were Kohathites (Numbers 3:19; Numbers 16:1), the Mahlites and Mushites were Merarites (Numbers 3:33). Two other families, the Shimites (Numbers 3:21) and the Uzzielites (Numbers 3:27; 1 Chronicles 26:23, and cf. Exodus 6:22; 1 Chronicles 24:24, 25), are omitted here, perhaps because the list is imperfect (see, however, the note on verse 62).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 59. - Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt. Rather, \"whom she (אֹתָהּ) bare.\" The missing subject is usually supplied, as in the A.V., and there certainly seems no more difficulty in doing so here than in 1 Kings 1:6. Some critics take \"Atha\" as a proper name - \"whom Atha bare;\" others render \"who was born;\" this, however, like the Septuagint, η{ ἔτεκε τούτους τῷ Λευὶ, requires a change of reading. Perhaps the text is imperfect. The statement here made, whatever difficulties it creates, is in entire agreement with Exodus 6:20; 1 Chronicles 23:6, 12, 13, and other passages. If two Amrams, the later of whom lived some 200 years after the earlier, have been confused (as we seem driven to believe), the confusion is consistently maintained through all the extant records (see the note on chapter Numbers 3:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 62. - Those that were numbered of them. We have here again a round number (23,000), showing an increase of 1000 since the former census. It is evident that the males of Levi were not counted by anything less than hundreds, and probable that they were counted by thousands (see note on chapter Numbers 3:29). The smallness of the increase in a tribe which was excepted from the general doom at Kadesh, and which in other ways was so favourably situated, seems to point to some considerable losses. It is possible that portions of the tribe suffered severely for their share in the rebellion of Korah; if so, the families of the Shimites and of the Uzzielites may have been so much reduced as to be merged in the remaining families.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:63VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:64VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers26:65VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 65. - There was not left a man of them. This had been known to be practically the case before they left the wilderness, properly so called (Deuteronomy 2:14, 15), but it was now ascertained for certain. For the necessary exceptions to the statement see note on chapter Numbers 14:24.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The daughters of Zelophehad. The genealogy here given agrees with those in Numbers 26:29-33 and in Joshua 17:3. These women would appear to have been in the eighth generation from Jacob, which hardly accords with the 470 years required by the narrative; some links, however, may have been dropped.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - By the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, i.e., evidently by the entrance of the sacred enclosure. Here, in the void space, in the midst of the camp, and close to the presence-chamber of God, the princes (i.e., the tribe princes who were engaged upon the census) and the representatives of the congregation assembled for the transaction of business and for the hearing of any matters that were brought before them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord. He had not been amongst the two hundred and fifty who gathered themselves together in support of Korah s pretensions. It does not appear why they should have thought it necessary to make this statement, unless they felt that the fact of his having died without sons might raise suspicion against him as one who had greatly provoked the wrath of God. But died in his own sin. This cannot mean that Zelophehad was one of those who died in the wilderness in consequence of the rebellion at Kadesh (see the next note). Apparently his daughters meant to acknowledge that they had no complaint against the Divine justice because of their father's death, but only against the law because of the unnecessary hardship which it inflicted upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Give unto us... a possession among the brethren of our father. The daughters of Zelophehad did not ask for any share of what had been their father's, but they asked that the lands which would have been assigned to their father in the settlement of Canaan might still be assigned to them, so that their father's name might attach to those lands, and be handed down with them. The request assumes that the \"brethren\" of Zelophehad would receive an inheritance in the promised land, either personally or as represented by their sons; hence it seems clear that Zelophehad was not of the elder generation, which had forfeited all their rights and expectations in Canaan, but of the younger, to whom the inheritance was transferred (Numbers 14:29-32). This is confirmed by the consideration that these women were not married until some time after this (Numbers 36:11; cf. Joshua 17:8, 4), and must, therefore, according to the almost invariable custom, have been quite young at this time. It is reasonable to suppose that the heads of separate families to whom the land was distributed would be at this time men of from forty-five to sixty years of age, comprising the elder half of the generation which grew up in the wilderness. Zelophehad would have been among these, but that he was cut off, perhaps in the plague of serpents, or in the plague of the Arboth Mesh, and left only unmarried girls to represent him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses brought their cause before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Moses brought their cause before the Lord. Presumably by going into the tabernacle with this matter upon his mind, and awaiting the revelation of the Divine will (cf. Exodus 18:19; Numbers 12:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - If a man die, and have no son. On this particular case a general rule of much wider incidence was founded. The Mosaic law of succession followed the same lines as the feudal law of Europe, equally disallowing disposition by will, and discouraging, if not disallowing, alienation by grant. Upon the land was to rest the whole social fabric of Israel, and all that was valued and permanent in family life and feeling was to be tied as it were to the landed inheritance. Hence the land was in every case so to pass that the name and fame, the privilege and duty, of the deceased owner might be as far as possible perpetuated. Unto his daughter. Not for her maintenance, but in order that her husband might represent her father. In most cases he would take her name, and be counted as one of her father's family. This had no doubt already become customary among the Jews, as among almost all nations. Compare the cases of Sheshan and Jarha (1 Chronicles 2:34, 35), of Jair (Numbers 32:41), and subsequently of the Levitical \"sons of Barzillai\" (Ezra 2:61). The question, however, would only become of public importance at the time when Israel became a nation of landed proprietors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A statute of judgment, לְחֻםקּת מִשְׁפָט.

It is impossible to determine the exact place of this announcement in the order of events narrated. It would appear from Numbers 31:1 that the war with the Midianites occurred later, and certainly the address to the people and to Joshua in Deuteronomy 31:1-8 presupposes the formal appointment here recorded; but the chronologer of the concluding chapters of Numbers is evidently very uncertain; they may, or may not, be arranged in order of time. We may with good reason suppose that the summons to die was only separated from its fulfillment by the brief interval necessary to complete what work was yet unfinished (such as the punishment of the Midianites and the provisional settlement of the trans-Jordanic country) before the river was crossed. Into this Mount Abarim. See on Numbers 33:47; Deuteronomy 32:49 sq., where this command is recited more in detail. Abarim was apparently the range behind the Arboth Moab, the northern portion of which opposite to Jericho was called Pisgah (Numbers 21:20; Deuteronomy 3:27), and the highest point Nebo (Deuteronomy 32:49; Deuteronomy 34:1), after the name of a neighbouring town (Numbers 33:47). And see the land. Moses had already been told that he should not enter the promised land (Numbers 20:12), yet he is allowed the consolation of seeing it with his eyes before his death. It would seem from Deuteronomy 3:25-27 that this favour was accorded him in answer to his prayer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For ye rebelled against my commandment. Rather, \"as ye rebelled.\" The same word, כַּאֲשֶׁר, quomodo, is used here as in the previous clause. That is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. These words have all the appearance of an explanatory gloss intended to make the reference more plain to the reader or hearer. It is impossible to suppose that they formed part of the Divine message; nor does it seem probable that Moses would have added them to the narrative as it stands, because, in view of Numbers 20:13, no necessity for explanation existed. It is quite possible that both Numbers 20:13 and the present clause are subsequent additions to the text intended to clear up an obvious confusion between the \"strife\" at Rephidim (Exodus 17:7) and that at Kadesh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And Moses spake unto the Lord. The behaviour of Moses as here recorded (see, however, on Deuteronomy 3:23 sq., which seems to throw a somewhat different light upon the matter) was singularly and touchingly disinterested. For himself not even a word of complaint at his punishment, which must have seemed, thus close at hand, more inexplicably severe than ever; all his thoughts and his prayers for the people - that one might take his place, and reap for himself and Israel the reward of all his toil and patience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them. A comparison with the words of Moses in Deuteronomy 31:2, and of Caleb in Joshua 14:11, shows that the going out and coming in refer to the vigorous prosecution of daily business, and the fatigues of active service. Which may lead them out, and which may bring them in. The underlying image is that of a shepherd and his flock, which suggests itself so naturally to all that have the care and governance of men (cf. John 10:3, 4, 16). As sheep which have no shepherd. And are, therefore, helpless, bewildered, scattered, lost, and devoured. The image is frequent in Scripture (cf. 1 Kings 22:17; Ezekiel 34:5; Zechariah 10:2; Matthew 9:36).

Joshua was now for the first time designated at the request of Moses as his successor; he had, however, been clearly marked out for that office by his position as one of the two favoured survivors of the elder generation, and as the \"minister\" and confidant of Moses. In regard of the first he had no equal but Caleb, in regard of the second he stood quite alone. A man in whom is the spirit. רוּחַ here, although without the definite article, can only mean the Holy Spirit, as in Numbers 11:25 sq. Lay thine hand upon him. According to Deuteronomy 34:9 this was to be done in order that Joshua might receive with the imposition of hands a spiritual gift (charisma) of wisdom for the discharge of his high office. It would appear also from the next paragraph that it was done as an outward and public token of the committal of authority to Joshua as the successor of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Give him a charge. צִוּיתָה.

This points to the essential difference between Moses and Joshua, and all who came after until the \"Prophet like unto\" Moses was raised up. Moses was as much above the priests as he was above the tribe princes; but Joshua was only the civil and military head of the nation, and was as much subordinate to the high priest in one way as the high priest was subordinate to him in another. In after times no doubt the political headship quite overpowered and overshadowed the ecclesiastical, but this does not seem to have been so intended, or to have been the case in Eleazar's lifetime. Who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord. Rather, \"who shall inquire for him in the judgment of Urim.\" בְּמִשְׁפַט הָאוּרִים. Septuagint, τὴν κρίσιν τῶν δήλων. The Urim of this passage and of 1 Samuel 28:6 seems identical with the Urim and Thummim of Exodus 28:30; Leviticus 8:8. What it actually was, and how it was used in con-suiting God, is not told us in Scripture, and has left no reliable trace in the tradition of the Jews; it must, therefore, remain for ever an insoluble mystery. It does not appear that Moses ever sought the judgment of Urim, for he possessed more direct means of ascertaining the will of God; nor does it seem ever to have been resorted to after the time of David, for the \"more sure word of prophecy\" superseded it. Its real use, therefore, belonged to the dark ages of Israel, after the light of Moses had set, and before the light of the prophets had arisen. At his word. Literally, after his mouth, i.e., according to the decision of Eleazar, given after consulting God by means of the Urim (cf.

It is impossible to say with any assurance whether the law of offerings contained in these two chapters was really given to Moses shortly before his death, or whether it was ever given in this connected and completed form. It is obvious that the formula with which the section opens might be used with equal propriety to introduce a digest of the law on this subject compiled by Moses himself, or by some subsequent editor of his writings from a number of scattered regulations, written or oral, which had Divine authority. It is indeed quite true that this routine of sacrifice was only suitable for times of settled habitation in the promised land, and therefore there is a certain propriety in its introduction here on the eve of the entry into Canaan. But it must be remembered, on the other hand, that the same thing holds true of very much of the legislation given at Mount Sinai, and avowedly of that comprised in chapter 15 (see verse 2), which yet appears from its position to have been given before the rebellion of Korah in the wilderness. It is indeed plain that the ritual, festal, and sacrificial system, both as elaborated in Leviticus and as supplemented in Numbers, presupposed throughout an almost immediate settlement in Canaan. It is also plain that a system so elaborate, and entailing so much care and expense, could hardly have come into regular use during the conquest, or for some time after. It cannot, therefore, be said with any special force that the present section finds its natural place here. All we can affirm is that the system itself was of Divine origin, and dated in substance from the days of Moses. In any case, therefore, it is rightly introduced with the usual formula which attests that it came from God, and came through Moses. It must be noted that a great variety of observances which were zealously followed by the Jews of later ages find no place here. Compare, e.g., the ceremonial pouring of water during the feast of tabernacles, to which allusion is made by the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 12:3) and our Lord (John 7:37, 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommand the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - My offering, and my bread. Literally, \"my korban, my bread.\" The general term korban (anything offered to God; cf. Numbers 7:3; Mark 7:11) is here restricted by the words which follow to the meat offering. \"Bread\" (לֶחֶם) is translated \"food\" in Leviticus 3:11, 16 (see the note there). Sweet savour. רֵיחַ.

The daily offering prescribed at Exodus 29:38-42, and which had presumably never been intermitted since, is specified again here because it formed the foundation of the whole sacrificial system. Whatever else was offered was in addition to it, not in lieu of it. The sabbath and festival use of the Jews was developed out of the ferial use, and rested upon it. Hence in a connected republication of the law of offering it could not be omitted. Without spot. תְמִימִם. Septuagint, ἀνώμους. This necessary qualification had not been expressed in the original ordinance, but in respect of other sacrifices had been continually required (see on Exodus 12:5; Leviticus 1:3; chapter Numbers 19:2; Hebrews 9:14; 1 Peter 1:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In the holy place. בַּקֹּדֶשׁ. Septuagint, ἐν τῷ ἀγίῳ. Josephus paraphrases this by περὶ τὸν βωμόν ('Ant.,' 3:10), and so the Targum of Onkelos; Jonathan and the Targum of Palestine render, \"from the vessels of the sanctuary.\" The former would seem to be the real meaning of the original. There is nowhere any specific direction as to the ritual of the drink offering (see on Leviticus 23, and Numbers 15:7, 10), nor is it certain whether it was poured at the foot of the altar (as apparently stated in Ecclus. 1. 15) or poured upon the flesh of the sacrifice on the altar (as seems to be implied in Philippians 2:17). The strong wine. שֵׁכָר. Septuagint, σίκερα. The Targums render it \"old wine,\" because the drink offering was in every other instance ordered to be made with wine (Exodus 29:40, &c.). Shecar, however, was not wine, but strong drink other than wine (such as we call \"spirits\"), and it is invariably used in that sense in contradistinction to wine (see on Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3, &c.). It can only be supposed that the difficulty of procuring wine in the wilderness had caused the coarser and commoner liquor to be substituted for it. It is certainly remarkable that the mention of shecar should be retained at a time when wine must have been easily obtainable, and was about to become abundant (Deuteronomy 8:8). As it would seem impossible that shecar should have been substituted for wine after the settlement in Canaan, its mention here may be accepted as evidence of the wilderness-origin of this particular ordinance. The quantity ordained (about a quart for each lamb) was very considerable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And on the sabbath day. The special offering for the sabbath is ordered here for the first time. It does not say when the two lambs were to be slain, but in practice it was immediately after the morning sacrifice of the day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The burnt offering of every sabbath. Literally, \"the sabbath burnt offering for its sabbath.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In the beginnings of your months. The new-moon offering also is here enjoined for the first time, the festival itself having only been incidentally mentioned in Numbers 10:10. There can be no doubt that this (unlike the sabbath) was a nature-festival, observed more or less by all nations. As such it did not require to be instituted, but only to be regulated and sanctified in order that it might not lend itself to idolatry, as it did among the heathen (cf. Deuteronomy 4:19; Job 31:26, 27; Jeremiah 7:18; Jeremiah 8:2). The new-moon feast, depending upon no calendar but that of the sky, and more clearly marked in that than any other recurring period, was certain to fix itself deeply in the social and religious habits of a simple pastoral or agricultural people. Accordingly we find it incidentally mentioned as a day of social gathering (1 Samuel 20:5), and as a day for religious instruction (2 Kings 4:23). From the latter passage, and from such passages as Isaiah 66:23; Ezekiel 46:1; Amos 8:5, it is evident that the feast of the new moon became to the month exactly what the sabbath was to the week - a day of rest and of worship (see also Judith 8:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - One kid of the goats. \"One hairy one (שָׂעִיר) of the she goats (עֵן).\" See on Numbers 7:16. This was probably offered first in order, according to the usual analogy of such sacrifices (Exodus 29:10-14). There is no authority for supposing that this sin offering superseded the one mentioned in Numbers 15:24 sq. This was essentially part of the customary routine of sacrifice; that was essentially occasional, and proper to some unforeseen contingency. It is likely enough that the national conscience would in fact content itself with the first, but it does not in the least follow that such was the intention of the legislator.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In the fifteenth day of this month is the feast. The fourteenth day of Abib, or Nisan, the day of the passover proper, was not a feast, but a fast ending with the sacred meal of the evening. Only the ordinary daily sacrifice was offered on this day. Unleavened bread. מַצּות (mattsoth).

This offering, the same for each day of Mattsoth as for the feast of the new moon, had not been prescribed before, and almost certainly not observed at the one passover kept in the wilderness (Numbers 9:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, i.e., in addition to, and immediately after, the usual morning sacrifice. Even when it is not expressly stated, the presumption is that all the sacrifices here treated of were cumulative. Thus the sabbath of the passover (John 19:31) would have the proper sacrificesNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of the day,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) of the sabbath,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) of the feast of Mattsoth, comprising two bullocks, one ram, eleven lambs, with their meat offerings and drink offerings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - In the day of the first-fruits.

The festal sacrifice here prescribed is exactly the same as for the days of Mattsoth and for the feast of the new moon. It is not the same as that prescribed for the same day in Leviticus 23, and it is difficult to determine whether it was meant to supersede the previous ordinance, or to be distinct and additional. The fact that no notice is taken of the sacrifice already ordered would seem to point to the former conclusion; but the further fact that no mention is made of the offering of wave-loaves, with which the sacrifices in Leviticus were distinctively connected, seems to show that the two lists were independent (cf. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:10, 6). The fact seems to be that throughout this section no sacrifices are mentioned save such as formed a part of the system which is here for the first time elaborated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers28:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEChapter 29:1. - In the seventh month, on the first day of the month.

This also was ordered, but not prescribed, in Leviticus 23. As it was the feast of the ingathering, when God had crowned the year with his goodness, and filled the hearts of men with food and gladness, so it was celebrated with the greatest profusion of burnt offerings, especially of the largest and costliest kind. Thirteen young bullocks. The number of bullocks was so arranged as to be one less each day, to be seven on the seventh and last day, and to make up seventy altogether. Thus the sacred number was studiously emphasized, and the slow fading of festal joy into the ordinary gladness of a grateful life was set forth. It seems quite fanciful to trace any connection with the waning of the moon. The observance of the heavenly bodies, although sanctioned in the case of the new moon feast, was not further encouraged for obvious reasons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and their drink offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work therein:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - On the eighth day.

All the offerings commanded in these chapters amounted to 1071 lambs, 113 bullocks, 37 rams, 30 goats, in the lunar year, together with 112 bushels of flour, more than 370 gallons of oil, and about 340 gallons of wine, supposing that the drink offering was proportionate throughout.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers29:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron.

The standard of the camp of Judah. Judah led the way not because he was the greatest in number, for the order of the tribes was not determined by this consideration, but because of his place in prophecy, and as the ancestor of the Messiah (Genesis 49:10). According to Aben Ezra and other Jewish expositors, the device upon the standard of Judah was a young lion, and this agrees with Revelation 5:5. The same authorities assign to Reuben a man, to Ephraim an ox (cf. Deuteronomy 33:17), to Dan an eagle. If it were so, we should find in these banners the origin of the forms of the living creatures in the visions of Ezekiel and St. John (Ezekiel 1:26; Ezekiel 10:1; Revelation 4:4-6), unless, indeed, the devices on the standards were themselves taken from the symbolic forms of the cherubim in the tabernacle, and these in their turn borrowed from the religious art of Egypt. But the tradition of the Jews is too fluctuating to carry any weight. The Targum of Palestine assigns to Judea the lion, but to Reuben a stag, to Ephraim a young man, and to Dan a basilisk serpent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the children of Issachar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Next unto him.

The Targum of Palestine (which embodies the traditional learning of the Palestinian Jews of the 17th century) says that the camp covered a space of twelve square miles. Modern writers, starting from some measurements of the Roman camps given by Polybius, compute the necessary space at three or three and a half miles square. This would require the strictest discipline and economy of space, and makes no provision for cattle; but supposing that the women and children were closely packed, it might suffice. It is, however, evident that there would be very few places in the wilderness, if any, where more than three square miles of fairly level ground could be found. In the plains of Moab the desired room might perhaps have been found, but scarcely anywhere in the wilderness of Paran. We must conclude, therefore, that this order of encampment was an ideal order, beautiful indeed by reason of its faultless regularity and equality, but only to be attained in practice as circumstances should permit, more or less. Indeed, that the foursquare symmetry of the camp had an ideal meaning and significance more really, because more permanently, important than its actual realization at the time, is evident from its recurrence again and again in the Apocalyptic writings (see Ezekiel 48:20, and especially Revelation 21:16). It is impossible to help seeing that the description of the heavenly Zion is that of a city, but of a city modeled upon the pattern of the camp in the wilderness. Here is one of those cases in which the spiritual significance of an order is of such importance that it matters comparatively little whether it could be literally carried out or not.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes. The regulations here laid down about vows follow with a certain propriety upon those concerning the ordinary routine of sacrifices (see verse 39 of last chapter), but we cannot conclude with any assurance that they were actually given at this particular period. It would appear upon the lace of it that we have in Leviticus 27, and in this chapter two fragments of Mosaic legislation dealing with the same subject, but, for some reason which it is useless to attempt to discover, widely separated in the inspired record. Nor does there seem to be any valid reason for explaining away the apparently fragmentary and dislocated character of these two sections (see the Introduction). The statement, peculiar to this passage, that these instructions were issued to the \"heads of the tribes\" itself serves to differentiate it from all the rest of the \"statutes\" given by Moses, and suggests that this chapter was inserted either by some other hand or from a different source. There is no reason whatever for supposing that the \"heads of the tribes\" were more interested in these particular regulations than in many others which concerned the social life of the people (such as that treated of in Numbers 5:5-31) which were declared in the ordinary way unto \"the children of Israel\" at large.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - If a man vow a vow. נֶדֶר, a vow, is commonly said to be distinctively a positive vow, a promise to render something unto the Lord. This, however, cannot be strictly maintained, because the Nazarite vow was neder, and that was essentially a vow of abstinence. To say that the vow of the Nazarite was of a positive character because he had to let his hair grow \"unto the Lord\" is a mere evasion. It is, however, probable that neder, when it occurs (as in this passage) in connection with issar, does take on the narrower signification of a positive vow. Swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond. Literally, \"to bind a bond upon his soul.\" אִסָּר, a bond, which occurs only in this chapter, is considered to be a restrictive obligation, a vow of abstinence. It would appear that the issar was always undertaken upon oath, whereas the neder (as in the case of the Nazarite) did not of necessity require it. He shall not break his word. This was the general principle with respect to vows, and, as here ]aid down, it was in accordance with the universal religious feeling of mankind. Whatever crimes may have claimed the sanction of this sentiment, whatever exceptions and safeguards a clearer revelation and a better knowledge of God may have established, yet the principle remained that whatsoever a man had promised unto the Lord, that he must fulfill. Iphigenia in Aulis, Jephthah's daughter in Gilead, proclaim to what horrid extremities any one religious principle, unchecked by other coordinate principles, may lead; but they also proclaim how deep and true this religious principle must have been which could so over-ride the natural feelings of men not cruel nor depraved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If a woman vow a vow. The fragmentary nature of this section appears from the fact that, after laying down the general principle of the sacredness of vows, it proceeds to qualify it in three special cases only of vows made by women under authority. That vows made by boys were irreversible is exceedingly unlikely; and indeed it is obvious that many cases must have occurred, neither mentioned here nor in Leviticus 27, in which the obligation could not stand absolute. In her father's house in her youth. Case first, of a girl in her father's house, who had no property of her own, and whose personal services were due to her father.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If her father disallow her. It appears from the previous verse that the disallowance must be spoken, and not mental only. If the vow had been made before witnesses, no doubt the father's veto must be pronounced before witnesses also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - If she had at all a husband. Literally, \"if being she be to an husband.\" Septuagint, ἐὰν γενομένη γένηται ἀνδρί. Case second, of a married or betrothed woman. As far as the legal status of the woman was concerned, there was little difference under Jewish law whether she were married or only betrothed. In either case she was accounted as belonging to her husband, with all that she had (cf. Deuteronomy 22:23, 24; Matthew 1:19, 20). When she vowed. Rather, \"and her vows be upon her.\" Septuagint, καὶ αἱ εὐχαὶ αὐτῆς ἐπ αὐτῇ. The vows might have been made before her betrothal, and not disallowed by her father; yet upon her coming under the power of her husband he had an absolute right to dissolve the obligation of them; otherwise it is evident that he might suffer loss through an act of which he had no notice. Or uttered ought out of her lips. Rather, \"or the rash utterance of her lips.\" The word מִבְטָא, which is not found elsewhere (cf. Psalm 106:33), seems to have this meaning. Such a vow made by a young girl as would be disallowed by her husband when he knew of it would presumably be a \"rash utterance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced. This is not one of the cases treated of in this section (see verse 16), but is only mentioned in order to point out that it falls under the general principle laid down in verse 2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - If she vowed in her husband's house. Case third, of a married woman living with her husband. The husband had naturally the same absolute authority to allow or disallow all such vows as the father had in the case of his unmarried daughter. The only difference is that the responsibility of the husband is expressed in stronger terms than that of the father, because in the nature of things the husband has a closer interest in and control over the proceedings of his wife than the father has over those of the daughter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Oath to afflict the soul. No doubt by fasting or by other kinds of abstinence. The expression is especially used in connection with the rigorous fast of the day of atonement (Leviticus 16:29; Numbers 29:7; and cf. Isaiah 58:5; 1 Corinthians 7:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Then he shall bear her iniquity, i.e., if he tacitly allowed the vow in the first instance, and afterwards forbad its fulfillment, the guilt which such breach of promise involved should rest upon him. For the nature and expiation of such guilt see on Leviticus 5,NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake unto Moses. The command to \"vex the Midianites, and smite them,\" had been given before (Numbers 25:17), but how long before we cannot tell. Possibly the interval had been purposely allowed in order that the attack when it was made might be sudden and unexpected. From the fact that no resistance would seem to have been made to the Israelitish detachment, and that an enormous amount of plunder was secured, we may probably conclude that the Midianites had thought all danger past.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAvenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites. The war was to be distinctly one of vengeance on the part of Israel. On the grave moral question which arises out of this war, and of the manner in which it was carried on, see the note at the end of the chapter. Afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. It is quite possible that Moses himself had been reluctant to order the expedition against Midian, either because it involved so much bloodshed, or, more probably, because he foresaw the difficulty which actually arose about the women of Midian. If so, he was here reminded that his place was to obey, and that his work on earth was not done so long as the Midianites remained unpunished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Avenge the Lord of Midian. God, speaking to Moses, had commanded a war of vengeance; Moses, speaking to the people, is careful to command a war of religious vengeance. In seducing the people of the Lord the Midianites had insulted and injured the majesty of God himself. On the question why Midian only, and not Moab also, was punished see on Numbers 25:17. It is to be remembered that, however hateful the sins of licentiousness and idolatry may be, they have never aroused by themselves the exterminating wrath of God. Midian was smitten because he had deliberately used these sins as weapons wherewith to take the life of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - There were delivered, or \"levied.\" יִמָּסְרוּ. Septuagint, ἐξηρίθμησαν The Hebrew word is only used here and in verse 16 (see note there), and in these two places not in the same sense. The context, however, leaves little or no doubt as to the meaning which it must bear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And Phinehas the son of Eleazar. The high priest himself could not leave the camp and the sanctuary, because of his duties, and because of the risk of being defiled (see verse 19); but his son, who was already marked out as his successor, could act as his representative (see on Numbers 16:37). In after times the Messiah Milchama (\"Sacerdos unctus ad bellum,\" alluded to in Deuteronomy 20:2) who accompanied the army to the field was a recognized member of the Jewish hierarchy. Phinehas was of course specially marked out by his zeal for the present duty, but we may suppose that he would have gone in any case. With the holy instruments, and the trumpets. Septuagint, καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἅγια καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες. The word instruments (כְּלֵי) is the same more usually translated \"vessel,\" as in Numbers 3:31, and is apparently to be understood of the sacred furniture of the tabernacle. It is difficult to understand what \"holy vessels\" could have accompanied an expedition of this sort, unless it were the ark itself. The Israelites were accustomed at all critical times to be preceded by the ark (Numbers 10:33; Joshua 3:14; Joshua 6:8), and the narrative of 1 Samuel 4:3 sq. shows plainly that, long after the settlement at Shiloh, no scruples existed against bringing it forth against the foes of Israel and of God. Indeed there is a resemblance in the circumstances between that ease and this which is all the more striking because of the contrast in the result. Most modern commentators, unwilling to believe that the ark left the camp (but cf. Numbers 14:44), identify the \"holy instruments\" with \"the trumpets;\" this, however, is plainly to do violence to the grammar, which is perfectly simple, and is contrary to the Septuagint and the Targums. The Targum of Palestine paraphrases \"holy instruments\" by Urim and Thummim; these, however, as far as we can gather, seem to have been in the exclusive possession of the high priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain. This is more accurately rendered by the Septuagint, τοῦς βασιλεὶς., ἀπέκτειναν ἅμα τοῖς τραυματίαις: \"they put to death (הָרַג) the kings, in addition to those who fell in battle\" (from חָלַל, to pierce, or wound). These five kings, who are mentioned here as having been slain in cold blood after the battle, are said in Joshua 13:21 to have been vassals (נְסִיכֵי) of the Amoritish king Sihon, and to have dwelt \"in the country.\" From this it has been concluded by some that the Midianites at this time destroyed included only certain tribes which had settled down within the territory afterwards assigned to Reuben, and had become tributary to Sihon. This would account for the fact that the present victory was so easy and so complete, and also for the otherwise inexplicable fact that the Midianites appear again as a formidable power some two centuries later. Zur. The father of Cozbi (Numbers 25:15). Balsam also... they slew with the sword. Not in battle, but, as the context implies, by way of judicial execution (see on Numbers 24:25; Joshua 13:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Their goodly castles. טִירֹתם. Septuagint, ἐπαύλεις. This word, which occurs only here and in Genesis 25:16, no doubt signifies the pastoral villages, constructed partly of rude stone walls, partly of goats-hair cloth, which the nomadic tribes of that country have used from time immemorial. Probably these were the proper habitations of the Midianites; the \"cities\" would have belonged to the previous inhabitants of the land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The spoil. הָשָּׁלָל.

No peculiar rites are here prescribed for the reception of these children of idolaters into the holy nation with which they were to be incorporated beyond the usual lustration with the water of separation.

There is something peculiar in this expression which points to the probability, either that this paragraph (verses 21-24) was added after the death of Moses, or that \"the law was already beginning, even in the lifetime of Moses, to assume the position which it after. wards held - that, viz., of a fixed code to be interpreted and applied by the living authority of the priesthood. This is the earliest instance of the high priest declaring to the people what the law of God as delivered to Moses was, and then applying and enlarging that law to meet the present circumstances. It is no doubt possible that Eleazar referred the matter to Moses, but it would seem on the face of the narrative that he spoke on his own authority as high priest. When we compare the ceremonial of the later Jews, so precisely and minutely ordered for every conceivable contingency, with the Mosaic legislation itself, it is evident that the process of authoritative amplification must have been going on from the first; but it is certainly strange to find that process begun while Moses himself was alive and active.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The brass.

This was an addition to the general law of lustration in chapter 19 founded on the obvious fact that water does not cleanse metals, while fire does. The spoils of the Midianites required purification, not only as being tainted with death, but as having been heathen property.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Take the sum of the prey. No notice is taken here of the spoil (see on verse 11), but only of the captured children and cattle. And the chief fathers. Perhaps אַבות (fathers) stands here for בֵּית־אָבות (fathers' houses).

This division was founded roughly upon the equity of the case; on the one hand, all Israel had suffered from Midian; on the other, only the twelve thousand had risked their lives to smite Midian. For the application of a like principle to other cases see Joshua 22:8; 1 Samuel 30:24; 2 Macc. 8:28, 30.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - An heave offering unto the Lord. Septuagint, τὰς ἀπαρὰς Κυρίου. The Hebrew word רוּם (to lift) from which terumah is derived, had practically lost its literal significance, just as the English word has in the phrase \"to lift cattle;\" hence terumah often means simply that which is set aside as an offering. No doubt the offering levied on the portion of the warriors was in the nature of tithe for the benefit of Eleazar and the priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - One portion of fifty. Two percent of the prey. This probably corresponded very closely to the number of Levites as compared with the twelve tribes, and would tend to show that God intended the Levites to be neither better nor worse off than their neighbours.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The booty, being the rest of the prey.

The officers naturally regarded this as a very wonderful circumstance; and so indeed it was, whether Midian made any resistance or not. It was, however, in strict keeping with the promises of that temporal dispensation. It would have been no satisfaction to the Israelite who fell upon the threshold of the promised land to know that victory remained with his comrades. His was not the courage of modern soldiers, who fling away their lives in blind confidence that some advantage will accrue thereby to the army at large; rather, he fought under the conviction that to each, as well as to all, life and victory were pledged upon condition of obedience and courage. In this case no one was found unfaithful, and therefore no one was allowed to fall.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - What every man hath gotten. The whole, apparently, of their booty in golden ornaments was given up as a thank offering, and in addition to this was all that the soldiers had taken and kept. The abundance of costly ornaments among a race of nomads living in squalid tents and hovels may excite surprise; but it is still the case (under circumstances far less favourable to the amassing of such wealth) among the Bedawin and kindred tribes (see also on Judges 8:24-26).

If, according to other estimates, the golden shekel was worth 30s., the value of the offering will have been some £25,000.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers31:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - Brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation.

It may have formed a fund for the support of the tabernacle services during the long years of neglect which followed the conquest, or it may have been drawn upon for national purposes. A memorial. To bring them into favourable remembrance with the Lord. For this sense of זִכָּרון (Septuagint, μνημόσυνον) cf. Exodus 28:12, 29. NOTE ON THE EXTERMINATION OF THE MIDIANITES. The grave moral difficulty presented by the treatment of their enemies by the Israelites, under the sanction or even direct command of God, is here presented in its gravest form. It will be best first to state the proceedings in all their ugliness; then to reject the false excuses made for them; and lastly, to justify (if possible) the Divine sanction accorded to them.NEWLINENEWLINEI. That the Midianites had injured Israel is clear; as also that they had done so deliberately, craftily, and successfully, under the advice of Balaam. They had so acted as if e.g., a modern nation were to pour its opium into the ports of a dreaded neighbour in time of peace, not simply for the sake of gain (which is base enough), but with deliberate intent to ruin the morals and destroy the manhood of the nation. Such a course of action, if proved, would be held to justify any reprisals possible within the limits of legitimate war; Christian nations have avenged far less weighty injuries by bloody wars in this very century. Midian, therefore, was attacked by a detachment of the Israelites, and for some reason seems to have been unable either to fight or to fly. Thereupon all the men (i.e., all who bore arms) were slain; the towns and hamlets were destroyed; the women, children, and cattle driven off as booty. So far the Israelites had but followed the ordinary customs of war, with this great exception in their favour, that they offered (as is evident from the narrative) no violence to the women. Upon their return to the camp Moses was greatly displeased at the fact of the Midianitish women having been brought in, and gave orders that all the male children and all the women who were not virgins were to be slain. The inspection necessary to determine the latter point was left presumably to the soldiers. The Targum of Palestine indeed inserts a fable concerning some miraculous, or rather magical, test which was used to decide the question in each individual case. But this is simply a fable invented to avoid a disagreeable conclusion; both soldiers and captives were unclean, and were kept apart; and the narrative clearly implies that there was no communication between them and the people at large until long after the slaughter was over. To put the matter boldly, we have to face the fact that, under Moses' directions, 12,000 soldiers had to deal with perhaps 50,000 women, first by ascertaining that they were not virgins, and then by killing them in cold blood. It is a small additional horror that a multitude of infants must have perished directly or indirectly with their mothers.NEWLINENEWLINEII. It is commonly urged in vindication of this massacre that the war was God's war, and that God had a perfect right to exterminate a most guilty people. This is true in a sense. If God had been pleased to visit the Midianites with pestilence, famine, or hordes of savages worse than themselves, no one would have charged him with injustice. All who believe in an over-ruling Providence believe that in one way or other God has provided that great wickedness in a nation shall be greatly punished. But that is beside the question altogether; the difficulty is, not that the Midianites were exterminated, but that they were exterminated in an inhuman manner by the Israelites. If they had been so many swine the work would have been revolting; being men, women, and children, with all the ineffaceable beauty, interest, and hope of our common humanity upon them, the very soul sickens to think upon the cruel details of their slaughter. An ordinarily good man, sharing the feelings which do honour to the present century, would certainly have flung down his sword and braved all wrath human or Divine, rather than go on with so hateful a work; and there is not surely any Christian teacher who would not say that he acted quite rightly; if such orders proceeded from God's undoubted representative today, it would be necessary deliberately to disobey them. It is urged again that the question at issue really was, \"whether an obscene and debasing idolatry should undermine the foundations of human society,\" or whether an awful judgment should at once stamp out the sinners, and brand the sin for ever. But no such question was at issue. There were obscene and debasing idolatries in abundance round about Israel, but no effort was made to exterminate them; the Moabites in particular seem to have been just as licentious as the Midianites at this time (see Numbers 25:1-3), and certainly were quite as idolatrous, and yet they were passed by. Indeed the argument shows an entire failure, so to speak, in moral perspective. Harlotry and idolatry are great sins, but there is no reason to believe that God deals with them otherwise than he does with other sins. It was no part of the Divine intention concerning Israel that he should go about as a knight-errant avenging \"obscene idolatries.\" Many a nation just as immoral as Midian rose to greatness, and displayed some valuable virtues, and (it is to be presumed) did some good work in God's world in preparation for the fullness of time. Harlotry and idolatry prevail to a frightful extent in Great Britain; but any attempt to pursue them with pains and penalties would be scorned by the conscience of the nation as Pharisaical. The fact is (and it is so obvious that it ought not to have been overlooked) that Midian was overthrown, not because he was given over to an \"obscene idolatry,\" wherein he was probably neither much better nor much worse than his neighbours; but because he had made an unprovoked, crafty, and successful attack upon God's people, and had brought thousands of them to a shameful death. The motive which prompted the attack upon them was not horror of their sins, nor fear of their contamination, but vengeance; Midian was smitten avowedly \"to avenge the children of Israel\" (verse 2) who had fallen through Baal-peor, and at the same time \"to avenge the Lord\" (verse 3), who had been obliged to slay his own people.NEWLINENEWLINEIII. The true justification of these proceedings - which we should now call, and justly call, atrocities - divides itself into two parts. In the first place, we have to deal only with the fact that an expedition was sent by Divine command, to smite the Midianites. Now, this does indeed open up a very difficult moral question, but it does not involve any special difficulty of its own. It is certain that wars of revenge were freely sanctioned under the Old Testament dispensation (see on Exodus 17:14-16; 1 Samuel 15:2, 3). It is practically conceded that they are permitted by the New Testament dispensation. At any rate Christian nations habitually wage wars of revenge even against half-armed savages, and many of those who counsel or carry on such wars are men of really religious character. It is possible that if the principles of the New Testament take a deeper hold upon the national conscience, all such wars will be regarded as crimes. This means simply, that in regard to war the moral sentiment of religious people has changed, and is changing very materially from age to age. Even a bad man will shrink from doing today what a good man would have done without the least scruple some centuries ago; and (if the world last) a bad man will be able sincerely to denounce some centuries hence what a good man can bring himself to do with a clear conscience today. Now it has been pointed out again and again that when God assumed the Jews to be his peculiar people, he assumed them not only in the social and political stage, but in the moral stage also, which belonged to their place in the world and in history. Just as God adopted, as King of Israel, the social and political ideas which then prevailed, and made the best of them; in like manner he adopted the moral ideas then current, and made the best of them, so restraining them in one direction, and so enforcing them in another, and so bringing them all under the influence of religious sanctions, as to prepare the way for the bringing in of a higher morality. What God did for the Jews was not to teach them the precepts of a lofty and perfect morality, which was indeed only possible in connection with the revelation of his Son, but to teach them to act in all things from religious motives, and with direct reference to his good pleasure. Accordingly God himself, especially in the earlier part of their history as a nation, undertook to guide their vengeance, and taught them to look upon wars of vengeance (since their conscience freely sanctioned them) as waged for his honour and glory, not their own. If this seem to any one unworthy of the Divine Beings let him consider for a moment, that on no other condition was the Old Testament dispensation possible. If God was to be the Head of a nation among nations, he must regulate all its affairs, personal, social, and national. We escape the difficulty, and wage wars of vengeance, and commit other acts of doubtful morality, without compromising our religion, because our religion is strictly personal, and our wars are strictly national. But the Old Testament dispensation was emphatically temporal and national; all responsibility for all public acts devolved upon the King of Israel himself. It was absolutely necessary, then, either that God should reveal Christian morality without Christ (which is as though one should have heat without the sun, or a poem without a poet); or that he should sanction the morality then current in its best form, and teach men to walk bravely and devoutly according to the light of their own conscience. That light was dim enough in some ways, but it was slowly growing clearer through the gradual revelation which God made of himself; and even now it is growing clearer, and still while religion remains fundamentally the same, morality is distinctly advancing, and good people are learning to abhor today what they did in the faith and fear of God but yesterday. Take, e.g., that saying, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay.\" For the Jew it meant that in waging wars of vengeance he fought as the Lord's soldier and not as in a private quarrel. For the Christian of the present day it means that revenge of private injuries is to be left altogether to the just judgment of the last day. To the Christian of some future age it will mean that all revenge for injuries and humiliations, private or public, individual or national, must be left to the justice of him who ordereth all things in this world or the world to come. Each has a different standard of morality; yet each, even in doing what another will abhor, may claim the Divine sanction, for each acts truly and religiously according to his lights. This being so, it is only necessary further to point out that the slaying of all the men whom they could get at was the ordinary custom of war in those days, when no distinction could be drawn between combatants and non-combatants. The practice of war in this respect is entirely determined by the sentiment of the age, and is always in the nature of a compromise between the desire to kill and the desire to spare. As these two desires can never be reconciled, they divide the field between them with a curious inconsistency. The first is satisfied by the ever-increasing destructiveness of war; the second is gratified by the alleviations which strict discipline and skilled assistance can procure for the vanquished and the wounded. Whether ancient or modern wars really left the larger tale of misery behind them is a matter of great doubt; but at any rate the custom of war sanctioned the slaughter of all the combatants, i.e., of all the men, at that time; and if war is to be waged at all, it must be allowed to follow the ordinary practice. In the second place, however, we have to deal with horrors of an exceptional character, in the subsequent slaughter of the women and boys. Now it is to be observed that the orders for this slaughter proceeded from Moses alone. According to the narrative of verse 13 sq., Moses went out of the camp, and on perceiving the state of the case, gave instructions at once while his anger was hot. It is possible that he sought for Divine guidance, but it does not appear that he did, but rather that he acted upon his own judgment, and under the ordinary guidance of his own conscience. We have not, therefore, to face the difficulty of a direct command from God, but only the difficulty of a holy man, full of heavenly wisdom, having ordered a butchery so abhorrent to our modern feelings. Let it then in all fairness be observed -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That Moses was not responsible for the presence of these captives. They ought either to have been killed, or left in their own land; it was either the cupidity or the mistaken pity of the soldiers which brought them there.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That Moses could not tolerate their presence in the host. It seems a vile thing to kill a woman, but it was the women more than the men of Midian of whom they bad just reason to be afraid. In justice to the men, in fairness to the wives, of Israel, it was simply impossible to let them loose upon the camp. Again, it seems cowardly to slay a helpless child; yet to suffer a generation of Midianites to grow up under the roofs of Israel would have been madness and worse, for it would have been to court a great and perhaps fatal national disaster. For the sake of Israel the captive women and children must be got rid of, and this could only be done either by slaughtering the women and boys, or by taking them back to their desolated homes to perish of hunger and disease. Of the two courses Moses certainly chose the more merciful. The nation was exterminated; the girls only were spared because they were harmless then, and likely to remain harmless; distributed through the households of Israel, without parents or brothers to keep alive the national sentiment, they would rapidly be absorbed in the people of the Lord; within a few weeks these girls of Midian would be happier, and certainly their future prospects would be brighter, than if they had remained unmolested at home. The charge, therefore, which remains against Moses is, that he ordered the slaughter in cold blood of many thousands of women and children, not unnecessarily nor wantonly, but for reasons which were in themselves very weighty. It is of course an axiom of modern times that we do not wage war against women and children. But this, while partly due to Christian feeling, is partly due to the conviction that they are not formidable. If in any war the women of the enemy habitually attempted to poison, and often did poison, our soldiers, they would probably meet with scant mercy. In blockading a fortified city a modern army deliberately starves to death a great many women and children; and if they seek to escape they are sent back to starve, and to induce the garrison to surrender by the spectacle of their sufferings. If this is justified (as no doubt it is if war is to be prosecuted at all) by the plea of necessity, Moses' plea of necessity must be heard also. He deliberately thought it better that these women and boys should be slaughtered than that the future of Israel should be gravely imperiled. In these days, indeed, he would be wrong in coming to that conclusion, and his name would be justly branded with infamy. It would be unquestionably better to incur any loss, rather than outrage in so violent a manner the Christian sentiment of pity and tenderness towards the young, the innocent, the helpless; it would be better to run any risk than to brutalize the soldiery by the execution of such an order. So slowly do sentiments of mercy establish themselves in the hearts of mankind, and so unspeakably valuable are they when established, that he would be a traitor against humanity and against God who should on any pretence outrage any one of them. But there was no such sentiment to outrage in the time of Moses; none thought it wrong to slay captive women and children if any necessity demanded their lives. It was an axiom of war that a captive belonged absolutely to his captor, and might be put to death, or sold as a slave, or held to ransom, as pleased him best, without any scruple of conscience. Moses, therefore sharing as he certainly did the sentiments of his age, was morally free to act for the best, without any thought whether it was cruel or not; and God did not interfere with his decision because it was cruel, any more than he did with the similar decision of other good men who warred, and slew, and spared not before the coming of Christ, and indeed since that coming too. Finally, if the method of separation was odious, it was still the only way possible under the circumstances of separating the harmless from the harmful, and of clearing mercy towards the captives from danger to the captors. And here again a proceeding could be sanctioned without sin then which perhaps no necessity could excuse now, because the sentiment of modesty which it would violate did not exist then, or rather did not exist in the same form.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The children of Reuben and the children of Gad. Reuben and Gad had both been camped on the same (southern) side of the tabernacle, but had not apparently been neighbours, since Simeon intervened on the march (see on Numbers 2:10-14). Simeon, however, was at this time enfeebled and disgraced, and was not likely to assert himself in any way. The \"great multitude of cattle\" belonging to the two tribes probably point to pastoral habits of long standing, since the cattle of the Amorites and Midianites would be equally divided among all. The land of Jazer. Jazer, or Jaazer, probably stood near the northern source of the Wady Hesban, which enters the Jordan not far from its mouth. The \"land of Jazer\" would seem to mean the Mishor, or plateau, of Heshbon, over which the Israelites had passed on their way to the plains of Moab (see on Deuteronomy 3:10, \"all the cities of the Mishor\"). The land of Gilead. Gilead as the name of a district only previously occurs in Genesis 37:25. It is used with a considerable latitude of meaning in this and the following books. In its widest sense it stands for the whole territory to the east of Jordan (see on verses 26, 29), including even the rugged, volcanic districts of Bashan (Deuteronomy 34:1; 1 Chronicles 5:16); but more properly it denoted the lands on both sides the Jabbok, from the Wady Hesban on the south, to the Yermuk and lake of Tiberias on the north, now known as the provinces of Belka and Jebel Ajlun. These lands are by no means uniformly flat, as the name \"Mount Gilead\" testifies, but include mountains and hills covered with fine open forests of oak (cf. 2 Samuel 18:8, 9) as well as rolling downs and treeless plains. The soil is almost everywhere of great fertility, and the water supply, although very scanty in summer, is sufficient if carefully husbanded. Even now these provinces produce great store of grain, and are depastured by vast flocks of sheep. In Roman times, as the innumerable ruins testify, they were filled with a large and opulent population. Indeed there could be no comparison in point of agricultural and pastoral value between these open and fertile lands and the broken, stony country of Southern Palestine. If they ever enjoy again the blessing of a strong government and continuous peace they will again justify the choice of Reuben and Gad. A place for cattle. מָקום (Septuagint, τόπος) is used here in the broader sense of district (cf.

As to the nine places here mentioned, see on verses 34-38. They all lie to the south of Gilead, properly so called, within a comparatively short distance of the route by which the main body of the Israelites had advanced. Probably the cattle which followed the host were still grazing under guard around these places, and it was very natural that tribes which had hitherto lived closely crowded together should not at first contemplate spreading themselves very far afield.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Bring us not over Jordan. The two tribes have been charged on the strength of these words with \"shameless selfishness,\" but there is nothing to justify such an accusation. If they thought at all of the effect of their request upon their brethren, it is quite likely that they intended to do them a kindness by leaving them more room on the other side Jordan; and indeed Canaan proper was all too strait for such a population. Whether they were wise in wishing to stay in the wider and more attractive lands which they had seen is another matter. They knew that the God of Israel had designed to plant his people between Jordan and the sea, and they certainly risked a partial severance from his promises and his protection by remaining where they did. The subsequent history of the trans-Jordanic tribes is a melancholy commentary on the real unwisdom of their choice. Yet it would have been difficult for them to know that they were wrong, except by an instinct of faith which no Israelites perhaps at that time possessed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here. Moses had good cause to feel great anxiety about the entry into Canaan proper. Once already the faith and courage of the people had failed them on the very threshold of the promised land, and a slight discouragement might bring about a similar calamity. Hence he spoke with a degree of sharpness which does not appear to have been deserved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Discourage. The verb נוא, translated \"discourage\" here and in verse 9, is of somewhat doubtful meaning. The Septuagint renders it by διαστρέφω, and perhaps the sense is, \"Why do ye draw away the heart?\" i.e., render it averse from going over.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thus did your fathers. It is impossible not to see that this mode of address is in striking contrast to that used in the Book cf. Deuteronomy (e.g., in Numbers 1:22, 27; Numbers 5:3, 23). At the same time it is obviously the more natural, and the more in accordance with facts, because there was not a man left of all those who had rebelled at Kadesh. At Kadesh-Barnea. This mode of writing the name forms a link between the closing chapters of Numbers (here and in Numbers 34:4) and the two following books. In Deuteronomy it occurs four times, and \"Kadesh\" twice. In Joshua \"Kadesh-Barnea\" occurs exclusively. In the later books \"Kadesh\" only is used, as in Genesis and in the previous chapters of Numbers. The meaning of the combination is uncertain, and the etymology of \"Barnea\" altogether obscure. It may be an old name attaching to the place before it became known as a sanctuary. The Septuagint has Κάδης τοῦ Βαρνή in one place, as though it were the name of a man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When they went up, i.e., no doubt the spies, although the word is not expressed.

Properly speaking, Israel had already emerged from the wilderness; but until they had fairly made good their possession of Canaan, their desert wanderings could not be considered at an end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Sheep-folds. גִּדְרֹת צֹאן.

Septuagint, ἀπὸ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. This phrase is here used in what is apparently its more natural sense, as it would be used by one dwelling in the plains of Moab (see on Numbers 22:1, and on next verse). Or forward. וָהָלְאָה. Septuagint, καὶ ἐπέκεινα, i.e., onwards towards the west and south and north, as the tide of conquest might flow. Our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. It does not appear on what ground they spoke so confidently. They do not seem to have received any Divine intimation that their lot was to be on the east of Jordan, but rather to have been guided by their own preference. If so, they cannot be acquitted of a certain presumptuous willfulness in action, and of a certain want of honesty in speech. The phrase here rendered \"on this side Jordan\" (מֵעֵבֶר הַיַּרְדֵּז) cannot be distinguished grammatically from that which bears an opposite signification in the preceding verse. In itself it is perfectly ambiguous without some qualifying word or phrase, and it is very difficult to know what the ordinary use of it was in the time of Moses. In later ages, no doubt, it came to mean simply the trans-Jordanic territory, or Peraea, without reference to the position of the speaker. The difficulty here is to decide whether the expression, as further defined by \"eastward,\" would actually have been used at that time and in that place, or whether the expression is due to a writer living on the west of Jordan. All we can say is, that the awkward use of the phrase in two opposite meanings, with words of clearer definition added, points more or less strongly towards a probability that the passage as it stands was written or revised at a later date.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Before the Lord. Perhaps in a quasi-local sense, as the vanguard of the host before the sacred symbols of the Lord's presence (see on chapter Numbers 10:21, and Joshua 6:9). But since the same expression (לִפְנֵי יְהוָה) is twice used in a much vaguer sense in verse 22, it is more probable that it only means \"in the Lord's service, or \"beneath his eye.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Be sure your sin will find you out. Or rather, \"ye will know your sin\" (וּדְעוּ חַטַּאתְכֶם) \"which shall find you out\" (for מָצָא cf. Genesis 44:16). So in effect the Septuagint: γνώσεσθε τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ὑῶν, ὅταν ὑμᾶς καταλάβῃ τὰ κακά. When they had cause to rue their folly, then they would recognize their sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBuild you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - In the cities of Gilead.

As no mention has been previously made of this tribe in this connection, we are left to conjecture why it should, contrary to all analogy, have been divided at all, and why the one half should have received the remote regions of Northern Gilead and Bashan. That the tribe was divided at all can only be explained by the pre-existence of some schism in its ranks, the probable origin and nature of which are discussed in the notes on verses 39, 41. The enormous increase in the tribal numbers during the wanderings (see on chapter Numbers 26:34) may have made the division more advisable, and the adventurous and independent character of the Machirites may have rendered it almost a necessity. They had not apparently preferred any request to Moses, but since the trans-Jordanic territory was to be occupied, Moses probably prevented a grave difficulty by recognizing their claim to the conquests they had made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The children of Gad built, i.e., no doubt, they put these places in some habitable and defensible state of repair until they should return. Dibon. Now Dhiban, four miles north of Arnon. It is called Dibon-gad in chapter Numbers 33:45, 46, but it is doubtful whether there is any allusion to its present occupation, since \"Gad\" was a common affix in the languages of Canaan (cf. Joshua 11:17). Dibon was subsequently assigned to Reuben (Joshua 13:9), but was recovered by Moab, and became one of his strongholds (of Isaiah 15:2; Jeremiah 48:18, 22) The Moabite stone was found here. Ataroth. Now Attarus, seven miles from Dibon. Aroer. Not the Aroer before Rabbath (Joshua 13:25), but the Aroer by the brink of Arnon (Deuteronomy 2:36; Joshua 13:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Atroth, Shophan. Rather, \"Atroth-Shophan,\" another Ataroth, the site of which is unknown. Jaazer. See on verse 1. Jogbehah. Now perhaps Jebeiha, to the north of Jaazer (cf. Judges 8:11). All these places were only temporarily occupied by the Gadites, and fell to Reuben in the subsequent division.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran. Supposed to be the present Nimrun and Beit-haran in the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the Israelitish camp. The latter would seem to have fallen subsequently to Reuben. Fenced cities, and folds for sheep. There should be no stop between these two clauses. All these places were \"built\" for the double purpose of affording protection to the families and to the flocks of the tribe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The children of Reuben. Reuben had, at the time of the last census, been greater in number than Gad, and had been his leader on the march. He now begins to take that secondary position which was always to be his. Of the towns which he now occupied, the Moabites recovered many, while the most important of all (Heshbon) had to be surrendered to the Levites. He was indeed compensated with the southern settlements of the Gadites as far as the Wady Hesban, but even so his limits were very straitened as compared with those of Gad and of half Manasseh. Heshbon. Cf. chapter Numbers 21:25. In Joshua 21:39; 1 Chronicles 6:81, Heshbon is spoken of as belonging to Gad. This can only be explained on the supposition that the temporary settlements of the two tribes were really intermixed, and that Heshbon, as the old capital of that region, was jointly occupied. In after times it, too, together with Elealeh and Kirjathaim, Nebo, Baal-meon, and Sibmah, all fell into the hands of Moab (Isaiah 15:2, 4; Isaiah 16:8; Jeremiah 48:22, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Baalomeon.

Their names being changed. מוּסַבֹּת שֵׁם, \"with change of name,\" dependent on the verb \"built.\" The Septuagint has περικεκυκλωμένας (Symmachus, περιτετευχισμένας), apparently reading שׁוּר for שֵׁם, but without authority. It is possible that the Been of verse 3 may be an instance of this attempt to change names, many of which were connected with idolatry. The attempt failed, but both the attempt itself and its failure were very characteristic of the partial and feeble hold which Israel had on this territory. Gave other names to the cities which they builded. Literally, \"they called by names the names of the towns;\" a round-about expression correctly paraphrased by the A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - The children of Machir. The relation of the Beni-Machir to the tribe of Manasseh is obscure, because all the Manassites were descended from Machir. In the absence of any direct information, we can only guess at the nature of the tie which united the Beni-Machir as a family, and kept them distinct from the other Manassite families. It is evident from their history that they formed a sub-tribe powerful enough to have a name of their own in Israel (cf. verse 40 and Judges 5:14, and see note on verse 41). Went to Gilead. This would seem to refer to the expedition briefly recorded in chapter Numbers 21:33. It is mentioned here out of place, in the simple historical style of the Pentateuch, because the gift of Gilead to Machir grew out of its conquest by Machir. The name Gilead is again used in a very vague sense, for the territory actually allotted to Machir was rather in Bashan than in Gilead proper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And he dwelt therein. This expression does not necessarily look beyond the lifetime of Moses, although it would be more naturally taken as doing so. In chapter Numbers 20:1 יֵֶּשב is used of the \"abiding\" of Israel at Kadesh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Jair the son of Manasseh. This hero of Manasseh is mentioned here for the first time; in Deuteronomy 3:14 his conquests are somewhat more fully described. His genealogy, which is instructive and suggestive, is given here.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEIt will be seen that Segub, the father of Jair, was a Machirite in the female line only. His father Hezron, according to 1 Chronicles 2:21, married the daughter of Manasseh in his old age, when his elder sons were probably already fathers of families. It may probably be conjectured also that Manasseh, who must have inherited exceptional wealth (cf. Genesis 48:17), and had but one grandson, left a large portion to his grand-daughter, the young wife of Hezron. It was therefore very natural that Segub should have attached himself to the fortunes of his mother's tribe. Is it not also very probable that Machir had other daughters (cf. Genesis 1:23), who also inherited large portions from their grandfather, and whose husbands were willing enough to enter into a family which had apparently brighter prospects than any others? If so, it would account at once for the existence of a large family of Machirites not descended from Gilead, and not on the most friendly terms with the rest of the tribe. It is quite possible that many of the more adventurous spirits amongst the tribe of Judah joined themselves to a family whose reputation and exploits they might naturally claim as their own (see on Joshua 19:34). The small towns thereof, or, \"their villages.\" Septuagint, τὰς ἐπαύλεις αὐτῶν, i.e. the hamlets of the Amorites who dwelt in Argob (Deuteronomy 3:14), the modern district of el Lejja, on the north-western waters of the Yermuk or Hieromax. And called them Havoth-jair. חָוּתֹ יָאִיר. Septuagint, τὰς ἐπαύλεις Ἰαίρ, and so the Targums. The word chavvoth only occurs in this connection, and is supposed by some to be the plural of חַוָּה, \"life.\" There does not, however, seem to be anything except the very doubtful analogy of certain German names in favour of the rendering \"Jair's lives.\" It is more likely the corruption of some more ancient name. There is some discrepancy in subsequent references to the Chavvoth-jair. According to 1 Chronicles 2:22, Jair had twenty-three towns in Gilead; from Judges 10:4 it appears that the sons of the later Jair had thirty cities \"in the land of Gilead\" which went under the name of Chavvoth-jair; while in Joshua 13:30 \"all the Chavvoth-jair which are in Bashan\" are reckoned at sixty. The plausible, though not wholly satisfactory, explanation is, that the conquests of Nobah came to be subsequently included in those of his more famous contemporary, and the vague name of Chavvoth-jair extended to all the towns in that part of Gilead, and of Bashan too (see notes on the passages cited).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers32:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Nobah. As this chieftain is nowhere else named, we may probably conclude that he was one of the companions of Jair, holding a position more or less subordinate to him. Kenath. The modern Kenawat, on the western slope of the Jebel Hauran, the most easterly point ever occupied by the Israelites. It is apparently the Nobah mentioned in Judges 8:11, but it has reverted (like so many others) to its old name. In spite of the uncertainties which hang over the conquest of this north-eastern territory, there is something very characteristic in the part played by the Machirite leaders. That they acted with an independent vigour bordering on audacity, that they showed great personal prowess, and had great personal authority with the humbler members of their family, and held something like the position of feudal superiors among them, is evident from the way in which they are spoken cf. And this is quite in keeping with the character of the Manassites in after times. The \"governors\" who came at the call of Barak, Gideon, the greatest of the warrior-judges, and probably Jephthah also (\"the Gileadite\"), as well as the younger Jail maintained the warlike and impetuous character of their race. If \"Elijah the Tishbite\" was really from this region (although this is extremely doubtful), we should find in him the characteristic daring and self-reliance of Machir transmuted into their spiritual equivalents.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.33":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - These are the journeys. The Hebrew word מַסְעֵי is rendered σταθμοί by the Septuagint, which means \"stages\" or \"stations.\" It is, however, quite rightly translated \"journeys,\" for it is the act of setting out and marching from such a place to such another which the word properly denotes (cf. Genesis 13:3; Deuteronomy 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Moses wrote their goings out (מוּצָא. Septuagint, ἀπάρσεις) according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord. The latter clause (עַל־פִי יְהוָה) may be taken as equivalent to an adjective qualifying the noun \"goings out,\" signifying only that their marches were made under the orders of God himself. It is more natural to read it with the verb \"wrote;\" and in that case we have a direct assertion that Moses wrote this list of marches himself by command of God, doubtless as a memorial not only of historical interest, but of deep religious significance, as showing how Israel had been led by him who is faithful and true faithful in keeping his promise, true in fulfilling his word for good or for evil. The direct statement that Moses wrote this list himself is strongly corroborated by internal evidence, and has been accepted as substantially true by the most destructive critics. No conceivable inducement could have existed to invent a list of marches which only partially corresponds with the historical account, and can only with difficulty be reconciled with it - a list which contains many names nowhere else occurring, and having no associations for the later Israelites. Whether the statement thus introduced tells in favour of the Mosaic authorship (as usually accepted) of the rest of the Book is a very different matter, on which see the Introduction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They departed from Rameses. Hebrew, Raemses. See on Exodus 1:11; 12:37. The brief description here given of the departure from Egypt touches upon every material circumstance as related at large in Exodus 11:41. In the sight of all the Egyptians. The journey was begun by night (Exodus 12:42), but was of course con-tinned on the following day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Buried all their first-born, which the Lord had smitten among them. Literally, \"were burying (Septuagint, ἔθαπτον) those whom the Lord had smitten among them, viz., all the first-born.\" The fact that the Egyptians were so universally employed about the funeral rites of their first-born - rites to which they paid such extreme attention - seems to be mentioned here as supplying one reason at least why the Israelites began their outward march without opposition. It is in perfect accordance with what we know of the Egyptians, that all other passions and interests should give place for the time to the necessary care for the departed. Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments. See on Exodus 12:12, and cf. Isaiah 19:1. The false deities of Egypt, having no existence except in the imaginations of men, could only be affected within the sphere of those imaginations, i.e., by being made contemptible in the eyes of those who feared them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Etham.

This is called the wilderness of Shur in Exodus 15:22, nor is it easy to explain the occurrence of the name Etham in this connection, for the Etham mentioned in verse 6 lay on the other side of the Red Sea. We do not, however, know what physical changes have taken place since that time, and it is quite possible that at Etham there may have been a ford, or some other easy means of communication, so that the strip of desert along the opposite shore came to be known as the wilderness of Etham.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Elim.

This encampment, like those at Dophkah and at Alush (verse 13), is not mentioned in the narrative of Exodus. The phraseology, however, used in Exodus 16:1; Exodus 17:1 leaves abundant room for intermediate halting-places, at which it is to be presumed that nothing very noteworthy happened Nothing whatever is known of these three stations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The wilderness of Sinai.

Comparing this verso with Numbers 12:16 and Numbers 13:26, it would appear as if Rithmah were the station \"in the wilderness of Paran\" from which the spies went up, and to which they returned - a station subsequently known by the name of Kadesh. There are two difficulties in the way of this identification. In the first place we should then only have three names of stations between Sinai and the southern border of Palestine, on what is at least eleven days' journey. This is, however, confessedly the case in the historical narrative, and it admits of explanation. We know that the first journey was a three days' journey (Numbers 10:33), and the others may have been longer still, through a country which presented no facilities for encamping, and possessed no variety of natural features. In the second place, Rithmah is not Kadesh, and cannot be connected with Kadesh except through a doubtful identification with the Wady Retemat in the neighbourhood of Ain Kudes (see note at end of chapter 13). It is, however, evident from Numbers 12:16, as compared with Numbers 13:26, that Kadesh was not the name originally given to the encampment \"in the wilderness of Paran.\" It seems to have got that name - perhaps owing to some popular feeling with respect to an ancient sanctuary, perhaps owing to some partial shifting of the camp - during the absence of the spies. Rithmah, therefore, may well have been the official name (so to speak) originally given to the encampment, but subsequently superseded by the more famous name of Kadesh; this would explain both its non-appearance in the narrative of Numbers, and its appearance in the Itinerary here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Rimmon-parez. The latter part of the name is the same as parats or perets, which commonly signifies a breaking out of . Divine anger. This place may possibly have been the scene of the events related in chapters 16, 17, but the Targum of Palestine connects them with Kehelathah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Libnah. Hebrew לִבְנָה (\"whiteness\") may perhaps be the same as the Laban (לָבָן, \"white\") mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:1. So many places, however, in that region are distinguished by the dazzling whiteness of their limestone cliffs that the identification is quite uncertain. The site of this, as of the next eight stations, is indeed utterly unknown; and the guesses which are founded on the partial and probably accidental similarity of some modern names (themselves differently pronounced by different travelers) are utterly worthless. Of these eight names, Kehelathah and Makheloth seem to be derived from קָהָל, \"an assembling,\" and thus give some slight support to the supposition that during the thirty-eight years the people were scattered abroad, and only assembled from time to time in one place. Rissah is variously interpreted \"heap of ruins,\" or \"dew;\" Shapher means \"fair,\" or \"splendid;\" Haradah, or Charadah, is \"terror,\" or \"trembling\" (cf. 1 Samuel 14:15); Tahath is a \"going down,\" or \"depression;\" Tarah is \"turning,\" or \"delay;\" Mithcah signifies \"sweetness,\" and may be compared (in an opposite sense) to Marah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Hashmonah. This is possibly the Heshmon of Joshua 15:27, since this was one of the \"uttermost cities... toward the coast of Edom, southward.\" The name, however (\"fruitfulness\"), was probably common on the edge of the desert. Moseroth. This is simply the plural form of Moserah (\"chastisement\"), and is no doubt the place so called in Deuteronomy 10:6 (see note at end of chapter).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Bene-Jaakan. The full name is given in Deuteronomy 10:6 as Beeroth-beni-Jaakan, \"the wells of the children of Jaakan.\" Jaakan, or Akan, was a grandson of Seir, the legendary tribe father of the Horites of Mount Seir (Genesis 36:20, 27; 1 Chronicles 1:42). The wells of the Beni-Jaakan may well have retained their name long after their original owners had been dispossessed; or a remnant of the tribe may have held together until this time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Hor-ha-gidgad. The MSS. and Versions are divided between Chor. (\"cave.\") and Her (\"summit,\" or \"mountain\"). Gid-gad is no doubt the Gudgodah of Deuteronomy 10:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Jotbathah. The meaning of this name, which is apparently \"excellent,\" is explained by the note in Deuteronomy 10:7 \"Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.\" It would be difficult to find such a land now in the neighbourhood of the Arabah, but there are still running streams in some of the wadys which open into the Arabah towards its southern end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Ebronah, or \"Abronah,\" a \"beach,\" or \"passage,\" called \"the Fords\" by the Targum of Palestine. It is conjectured that it lay below Ezion-geber, just opposite to Elath, with which place it may have been connected by a ford at low tide, but this is quite uncertain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Ezion-gaber, or rather \"Etsion-geber,\" the \"giant's backbone.\" This can hardly be other than the place mentioned in 1 Kings 9:26; 2 Chronicles 8:17 as the harbour of King Solomon's merchant navy. At this later date it was at the head of the navigable waters of the Elanitic Gulf, but considerable changes have taken place in the shore line since the age of Solomon, and no doubt similar changes took place before. It was known to, and at times occupied by, the Egyptians, and the wretched village which occupies the site is still called Aszium by the Arabs. The name itself would seem to be due to some peculiar rock formation - probably the serrated crest either of a neighbouring mountain or of a half-submerged reef.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

See on Numbers 20:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - In the fortieth year... in the first day of the fifth month. This is the only place where the date of Aaron's death is given. It is in strict accordance with the Divine intimation that Israel was to wander forty years in the wilderness (Numbers 14:33, 34), that period being understood, according to the usual mercy of God, which shortens the days of evil, to include the time already spent in the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - An hundred and twenty and three years old. He had been eighty-three years old when he first stood before Pharaoh, forty years before (Exodus 7:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And king Arad... heard of the coming. See on chapter Numbers 21:1. The introduction of this notice, for which there seems no motive, and which has no assignable connection with the context, is extremely perplexing. It is not simply a fragment which has slipped in by what we call accident (like Deuteronomy 10:6, 7), for the longer statement in chapter Numbers 21:1-3 occupies the same position in the historical narrative immediately after the death of Aaron. It is difficult to suppose that Moses wrote this verse and left it as it stands; it would rather seem as if a later hand had begun to copy out a statement from some earlier document - in which it had itself perhaps become misplaced - and had not gone on with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Zalmonah. This place is not elsewhere mentioned, and cannot be identified. Either this or Punon may be the encampment where the brazen serpent was set up; according to the Targum of Palestine it was the latter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Punon. Perhaps connected with the Pinon of Genesis 36:41. The Septuagint has Φινώ, and it is identified by Eusebius and Jerome with Phaeno, a place between Petra and Zoar where convicts were sent to labour in the mines. Probably, however, the march of the Israelites lay further to the east, inasmuch as they scrupulously abstained from trespassing upon Edom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Oboth... Ije-abarim. See on Numbers 21:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Dibon-gad. This encampment may have been the same as that previously called by the name of Nabaliel or Bamoth (Numbers 21:19, and see on Numbers 33:34). Several stages are here passed over in the Itinerary. At a time when the conquest and partial occupation of large districts was going on, it would be hard to say what regular stages were made by the host as such (see note at end of chapter).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - Almon-diblathaim. Probably the same as the Beth-diblathaim mentioned in Jeremiah 48:22 as a Moabitish town contignous to Dibon, Nebo, and Kiriathaim. The name, which signifies \"hiding-place of the two circles\" or \"cakes,\" was doubtless due either to some local legend, or more probably to the fanciful interpretation of some peculiar feature in the landscape.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - The mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. The same locality is called \"the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward the waste,\" in Numbers 21:20 (see note there, and at Numbers 27:12). Nebo is the name of a town here, as in Numbers 32:3, 38, and in the later books; in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 32:49; Deuteronomy 34:1) it is the name of the mountain, here included in the general designation Abarim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - In the plains of Moab. See on Numbers 22:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - From Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim. Beth-jesimoth, \"house of the wastes,\" must have been very near the point where Jordan empties itself into the Dead Sea, on the verge of the salt desert which bounds that sea on the east. It formed the boundary of Sihon's kingdom at the south-west corner. Abel-shittim, \"meadow of acacias,\" is better known by the abbreviated name \"Shittim\" (Numbers 25:1; Micah 6:5). Its exact site cannot be recovered, but the Talmud states that it was twelve miles north of the Jordan mouth. Probably the center of the camp was opposite to the great fords, and the road leading to Jericho. NOTE ON THE TWO LISTS OF STATIONS BETWEEN EGYPT AND THE JORDAN. There can be no question that the chief interest of the Itinerary here given is due to its literary character as a document containing elements at least of extreme and unquestioned antiquity. At the same time it is a matter of some importance to compare it with the history as given at large in Exodus and Numbers, and to note carefully the points of contact and divergence. It is evident at first sight that no pains have been taken to make the two lists of stages agree, each list containing several names which the other lacks, and (in some cases) each having a name of its own for what appears to be the same place. With respect to the latter point, the explanation usually given seems quite natural and satisfactory: the names were in many cases given by the Israelites themselves, and in others were derived from some small local peculiarity, or belonged to insignificant hamlets, so that the same encampment may very well have received one name in the official record of the movements of the tabernacle, and retained another in the popular recollection of the march. With respect to the former point, it may fairly be argued that the narrative only records as a rule the names of places where something memorable occurred, and indeed does not always mention the place even then, while the Itinerary is simply concerned with the consecutive encampments as such. It would be more correct to say that the narrative is essentially fragmentary, and does not purport to record more than certain incidents of the wanderings. We have, therefore, no difficulty in understanding why the Itinerary gives us the names of three stations between Egypt and Mount Sinai not mentioned in Exodus. There is much more difficulty with the ensuing notices, because the name of Kadesh only occurs once in the list, whereas it is absolutely necessary, in order to bring the narrative into any chronological sequence, to assume (what the narrative itself pretty clearly intimates) that there were two encampments at Kadesh, separated by an interval of more than thirty-eight years. It has accordingly been very generally agreed that the Rithmah of the Itinerary is identical with the nameless station \"in the wilderness of Paran,\" afterwards called Kadesh in the narrative. This is of course an assumption which has only probabilities to support it, but it may fairly be said that there is nothing against it. The retem, or broom, is so common that it must have given a name to many different spots - a name too common, and possessing too few associations, to stand its ground in popular remembrance against any rival name (see note on verse 18). It has been argued by some that the whole of the twenty-one stages enumerated in verses 16-35 were made on the one journey from Sinai to Kadesh; and as far as the mere number goes there is nothing improbable in the supposition; the \"eleven days\" of Deuteronomy 1:2 are no doubt the days of ordinary travelers, not of women and children, flocks and herds. It is true that the supposition is commonly connected with a theory which throws the whole historical narrative into confusion, viz., that Israel spent only two years instead of forty in the wilderness; but that need not cause its rejection, for the whole thirty-eight may be intercalated between verse 36 and verse 37 of the Itinerary, and we could explain a total silence concerning the wanderings of those years better than we can the mention of (only) seventeen stations. The only serious difficulty is presented by the name Ezion-geber, which it is very difficult not to identify with the place of that name, so well known afterwards, at the head of the Elanitic Gulf; for it is impossible to find the last stage towards Kadesh at a spot as near to Sinai as to any of the supposed sites of Kadesh. It is of course possible that more than one place was known as the \"giant's backbone;\" but, on the other hand, the fact that at Moseroth Israel was near Mount Hor, and that they made five marches thence to Ezion-geber, is quite in accordance with the site usually assigned to it. It must remain, therefore, an unsettled point as to which nothing more can be said than that a balance of probabilities is in favour of the identification of Rithmah with the first encampment at Kadesh. Proceeding on this assumption, we have thereafter eleven names of stations concerning which nothing is known, and nothing can be with any profit conjectured. Then come four others which are evidently the same as those mentioned in Deuteronomy 10:6, 7. That this latter passage is a fragment which has come into its present position (humanly speaking) by some accident of transcription does not admit of serious debate; but it is evidently a fragment of some ancient document, possibly of the very Itinerary of which we have only an abbreviation here. Comparing the two, we are met at once with the difficulty that Aaron is said to have died and been buried at Moserah, whereas, according to the narrative and the Itinerary, he died on Mount Hor during the last journey from Kadesh. This is not unnaturally explained by assuming that the official name of the encampment under, or opposite to, Mount Hor, from which Aaron ascended the mountain to die, was Moserah or Moseroth, and that the Israelites were twice encamped there - once on their way to Ezion-geber and back to Kadesh, and again on the last march round Edom, to which the fragment in Deuteronomy refers. There remain, however, unexplained the singular facts -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the station where Aaron died is called Moserah in Deuteronomy 10:6, whereas it is called Mount Hor not only in the narrative, but in the Itinerary, which nevertheless does give the name Moseroth to this very station when occupied on a previous occasion.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the fragment gives Bene-Jaakan, Moseroth, Gudgod, and Jotbath as stages on the last journey, whereas the Itinerary gives them (the order of the first two being inverted) as stages on a previous journey, and gives other names for the encampments of the last journey. There is no doubt room for all four, and more besides, between Mount Hor and Oboth; but it cannot be denied that there is an appearance of error either in the fragment or in the Itinerary. A further objection has been made to the statement that Israel marched from Ezion-geber to Kadesh, both on the score of distance and of the apparent absurdity of returning to Kadesh only to retrace their steps once more. It is repliedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the return to Kadesh for the final move may have been hurried, and no regular encampment pitched;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that when Israel returned to Kadesh it was still in expectation of entering Canaan \"by the way of the spies,\" and in ignorance that they would have to treat with Edom for a passage - much more that they would have to come down the Arabah once again. Lastly, with respect to the names which occur after Ije-abarim, we have again an almost total want of coincidence with this peculiarity, that the narrative gives seven names where the Itinerary only gives three. It must, however, be remembered that the whole distance from the brook of Arnon, where the Israelites crossed it, to the Arboth Moab is only thirty miles in a straight line. Over this short distance it is quite likely that the armies of Israel moved in lines more or less parallel, the tabernacle probably only shifting its place as the general advance made it desirable. That the two accounts are based on different documents, or drawn from different sources, is likely enough; but both may nevertheless be equally correct. If (as regards the last march) one record was kept by Eleazar, and another by Joshua, the apparent disagreement may be readily explained.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 33:50-34:29NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - And the Lord spake. It is quite obvious that a new section begins here, closely connected, not with the Itinerary which precedes it, but with the delimitation which follows. The formula which introduces the present command is repeated in Numbers 35:1, and again in the last verse of chapter 36, thus giving a character of its own to this concluding portion of the Book, and to some extent isolating it from the rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - When ye are passed over Jordan. Previous legislation had anticipated the time when they should have come into their own land (cf. Numbers 15:2; Leviticus 23:10), but now the crossing of the river is spoken of as the last step on their journey home.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - Ye shall drive out. The Hebrew word (from יָרַשׁ) is the same which is translated \"dispossess\" in the next verse. The Septuagint has in both cases ἀπολεῖτε, supplying (like the A.V.) the word \"inhabitants\" in verse 53. The Hebrew word, however, seems to have much the same sense as the English phrase \"clear out,\" and is, therefore, equally applied to the land and the occupants of it. No doubt it implies extermination as a necessary condition of the clearance. Their pictures. מַשְׂכִּלֺיּתָם. Septuagint, τὰς σκοπιὰς αὐτῶν, (their outlooks, or high places). The Targums of Onkelos and Palestine have \"the houses of their worship;\" the Targum of Jerusalem has \"their idols.\" The same word occurs in Leviticus 26:1, in the phrase אֵבֶן מַשְׂכִּית, which is usually rendered \"a stone image,\" i.e., a stone shaped into some likeness of man. If so, מַשְׂכִּית by itself has probably the same meaning; at any rate it can hardly be \"a picture,\" nor is there the least evidence that the art of painting was at all practiced among the rude tribes of' Canaan. The same word, maskith, is indeed found in Ezekiel 8:12 in connection with \"gravings\" (from חָקַק; cf. Isaiah 22:16; Isaiah 49:18 with Ezekiel 4:1; Ezekiel 23:14) on a wall; but even this belonged to a very different age. Their molten images, צַלְמֵי מַסֵּכֹתָם, \"images cast of brass.\" Septuagint, τὰ εἰδωλα τὰ χονευτά The word tselem is only elsewhere used in the Pentateuch for that \"likeness\" which is reproduced in Divine creation (Genesis 1:26, 27; Genesis 9:6) or in human generation (Genesis 5:3); in the later books, however (especially in Daniel), it is freely used for idols. On \"massakah,\" see on Exodus 32:4; Isaiah 30:22. Their high places. בָמוֹתָם. See on Leviticus 26:30. The Septuagint translates Bamoth in both places by στῆλαι, and of course it was not the high places themselves, which were simply certain prominent elevations, but the monuments (of whatever kind) which superstition had erected upon them, which were to be plucked down. As a fact, it would seem that the Jews, instead of obeying this command, appropriated the Bamoth to their own religious uses (cf. 1 Samuel 9:12; 1 Kings 3:2; Psalm 78:58, &c.). The natural result was, as in all similar cases, that not only the Bamoth, but very many of the superstitions and idolatries connected with them, were taken over into the service of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - I have given you the land. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" and no one, therefore, can dispute his right in the abstract to evict any of his tenants and to put others in possession. But while the whole earth was the Lord's, it is clear that he assumed a special relation towards the land of Canaan, as to which he chose to exercise directly the rights and duties of landlord (see on Deuteronomy 22:8 for a small but striking instance). The first duty of a landlord is to see that the occupancy of his property is not abused for illegal or immoral ends; and this duty excuses, because it necessitates, eviction under certain circumstances. It is not, therefore, necessary to argue that the Canaanites were more infamous than many others; it is enough to remember that God had assumed towards the land which they occupied (apparently by conquest) a relation which did not allow him to overlook their enormities, as he might those of other nations (see on Exodus 23:23-33; 34:11-17, and cf. Acts 14:16; Acts 17:30). It was (if we like to put it so) the misfortune of the Canaanites that they alone of \"all nations\" could not be suffered to \"walk in their own ways,\" because they had settled in a land which the Lord had chosen to administer directly as his own earthly kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - Ye shall divide the land by lot. These directions are repeated in substance from Numbers 26:53-56. Every man's inheritance. Not only the tribe, but the family and the household, was to receive its special inheritance by lot; no doubt in such a way that the final settlement of the country would correspond with the blood relationships of the settlers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - If ye will not drive out the inhabitants. As was in fact the case (Judges 1). The warning is here given for the first time, because the danger was now near at hand, and had indeed already shown itself in the matter of the Midianitish women and children. Pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides. Natural symbols of dangerous annoyances. Possibly the thickets which fringe the Jordan supplied them with present examples. In Joshua 23:13 we have \"scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes,\" which sounds somewhat more artificial. In Judges 2:3, where this warning is quoted, the figure is not expressed at all: \"they shall be in your sides.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers33:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - I shaft do unto you as I thought to do unto them, i.e., I shall execute by other hands upon you the sentence of dispossession which ye shall have refused to execute upon the Canaanites. The threat (although in fact fulfilled) does not necessarily involve any prophecy, since to settle down among the remnants of the heathen was a course of action which would obviously and for many reasons commend itself to the Israelites. Indolence and cowardice were consulted by such a policy as much as the natural feelings of pity towards vanquished and apparently harmless foes. The command to extirpate was certainly justified in this case (if it could be in any) by the unhappy consequences of its neglect. Israel being what he was, and so little severed in anything but religion from the ancient heathen, his only chance of future happiness lay in keeping himself from any contact with them. On the morality of the command itself, see on the passages referred to, and on the slaughter of the Midianites. As a fact, the extirpation of the conquered did not offend the moral sense of the Jews then any more than it did that of our heathen Saxon ancestors. Where both races could not dwell in security, it was a matter of course that the weaker was destroyed. Such a command was therefore justified at that time by the end to be attained, because it was not contrary to the moral law as then revealed, or to the moral sense as then educated. Being in itself a lawful proceeding, it was made a religious proceeding, and taken out of the category of selfish violence by being made a direct command of God.NEWLINE","Num.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommand the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)VERSEENDNEWLINEChapter 34:2. - Into the land of Canaan. Canaan has here its proper signification as the land (roughly speaking) between Jordan and the sea (so in Numbers 32:32; Joshua 22:11, 82). Nor is there any clear instance of its including the trans-Jordanic territories. In the prophets the word reverts to its proper (etymological) meaning, as the \"flat country\" along the Mediterranean coast (cf. Isaiah 19:18; Zephaniah 2:5; Matthew 15:22). This is the land that shall fall unto you. These words should not be placed in a parenthesis; it is a simple statement in the tautological style so common in these books. With the coasts thereof, or, \"according to its boundaries,\" i.e., within the limits which nature and the Divine decree had set to the land of Canaan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Then your south quarter. Rather, \"and your south side.\" From the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom. This general preliminary definition of the southern frontier marks the \"wilderness of Zin\" as its chief natural feature, and asserts that this wilderness rested \"upon the sides\" (עַל־יְדֵי) of Edom. The wilderness of gin can scarcely be anything else than the Wady Murreh, with more or less of the barren hills which rise to the south of it, for this wady undoubtedly forms the natural southern boundary of Canaan. All travelers agree both as to the remarkable character of the depression itself and as to the contrast between its northern and southern mountain walls. To the south lies the inhospitable and un-cultivatable desert; to the north the often arid and treeless, but still partially green and habitable, plateau of Southern Palestine. The expression, \"on the sides of Edom,\" can only mean that beyond the Wady Murreh lay territory belonging to Edom, the Mount Seir of Deuteronomy 1:2, the Seir of Deuteronomy 1:44; it does not seem possible that Edom proper, which lay to the east of the Arabah, and which barely marched at all with the land of Canaan, should be intended here (see on Joshua 15:1, and the note on the site of Kadesh). And your south border. This begins a fresh paragraph, in which the southern boundary, already roughly fixed, is described in greater detail. Shall be the utmost coast of the salt sea eastward. Rather, \"shall be from the extremity (מִקְצֵה) of the salt sea eastward\" (cf. Joshua 15:2). The easternmost point in this boundary was to be fixed at the southernmost extremity of the Salt Sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim.

The A.V., which follows the Septuagint and the Targums, does not seem to give any sense, while the rendering, \"to the south side of the ascent,\" does not seem grammatically defensible. Moreover, it is quite uncertain where the \"ascent of Akrabbim,\" i.e., the \"Scorpion-pass,\" or \"Scorpion-stairs,\" is to be placed. Some travelers have recognized both place and name in a precipitous road which ascends the northern cliffs towards the western end of the Wady Murreh, and which the Arabs call Nakb Kareb; others would make the ascent to be the steep pass of es Sufah, over which runs the road from Petra to Hebron; others, again, identify the Scorpion-stairs with the row of white cliffs which obliquely cross and close in the Ghor, some miles south of the Salt Sea, and separate it from the higher level of the Arabah. None of these identifications are satisfactory, although the first and last have more to be said in their favour than the second. Possibly the ascent of Akrabbim may have been only the Wady Fikreh, along which the natural frontier would run from the point of the Salt Sea into the Wady Murreh. Pass on to Zin. It is only here and in Joshua 15:3 that the name Zin stands by itself; it may have been some place in the broadest part of the Wady Murreh which gave its name to the neighbouring wilderness. From the south to Kadesh-barnea. Here again we have the expression מִנֶּגֶב לְאּ, of which we do not know the exact force. But if Kadesh was in the neighbourhood of the present Ain Kudes, then it may be understood that the frontier, after reaching the western end of the Wady Murreh, made a detour to the south so as to include Kadesh, as a place of peculiarly sacred memory in the annals of Israel. It is indeed very difficult, with this description of the southern frontier of Canaan before us, to believe that Kadesh was in the immediate neighbourhood of the Arabah, where many commentators place it; for if that were the case, then the boundary line has not yet made any progress at all towards the west, and the only points given on the actual southern boundary are the two unknown places which follow. Hazar-addar. In Joshua 15:3 this double name is apparently divided into the two names of Hezron and Addar, but possibly the latter only is the place intended here. A Karkaa is also mentioned there, which is equally unknown with the rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The river of Egypt, or \"brook (נַחַל) of Egypt.\" Septuagint, χειμά ῤουν Αἰγύπτου. It was a winter torrent which drained the greater part of the western half of the northern desert of the Sinaitic peninsula. It was, however, only in its lower course, where a single channel receives the intermittent outflow of many wadys, that it was known as the \"brook of Egypt,\" because it formed the well-marked boundary between Egypt and Canaan (cf. 2 Chronicles 7:8, and Isaiah 27:12, where the Septuagint has ἕως Ρινοκορούρων, from the name of the frontier fort, Rhinocorura, afterwards built there). So far as we are able to follow the line drawn in these verses, it would appear to have held a course somewhat to the south of west for about half its length, then to have made a southerly deflection to Kadesh, and from thence to have struck north-west until it reached the sea, almost in the same latitude as the point from which it started.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And as for the western border. The Hebrew word for \"west\" (יָם) is simply that for \"sea,\" because the Jews in their own land always had the sea on their west. Thus the verse reads literally, \"And the sea boundary shall be to you the great sea and boundary; this shall be to you the sea boundary.\" It would seem very unlikely that the Jews familiarly used the word \"yam\" for \"west\" after a residence of several centuries in a country where the sun set not over the sea, but over the desert. Nothing can of course be proved kern the use of the word here, but it cannot be overlooked as one small indication that the language of this passage at any rate is the language of an age subsequent to the conquest of Canaan (see on Exodus 10:19; 26:22, and Numbers 2:18) The line of coast from the brook of Egypt to the Leontes was upwards of 160 miles in length.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Ye shall point out for you, i.e., ye shall observe and make for, in tracing the boundary. Septuagint, καταμετρήσετε... παρά Mount Hor. Not of course the Mount Hor on which Aaron died, but another far to the north, probably in Lebanon. The Hebrew הֹר הָהָר, which the Septuagint had rendered Ὤς τὸ ὄρος in chapter 20, it renders here τὸ ὄρος τὸ ὄρος, taking הֹר as simply another form הָר, as it probably is. Her Ha-har is therefore equivalent to the English \"Mount Mountain ;\" and just as there are many \"Avon rivers\" on the English maps, so there were probably many mountains locally known among the Jews as Hor Ha-hat. We do not know what peak this was, although it must have been one clearly distinguishable from the sea. There is, however, no reason whatever for supposing (contrary to the analogy of all such names, and of the other Mount Hor) that it included the whole range of Lebanon proper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - From Mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath. Literally, \"from Mount Hor point out (תְּתָאוּ, as in the previous verse) to come to Hamath,\" which seems to mean, \"from Mount Hor strike a line for the entrance to Hamath.\" The real difficulty lies in the expression לְבאֹ חַמָת, which the Septuagint renders εἰσπορευομέν ον εἰς Ἐμάθ, \"as men enter into Hamath.\" The same expression occurs in Numbers 13:21, and is similarly rendered by the Septuagint. A comparison with Judges 3:3 and other passages will show that \"Ibo Chamath\" had a definite geographical meaning as the accepted name of a locality in the extreme north of Canaan. When we come to inquire where \"the entrance to Hamath\" was, we have nothing to guide us except the natural features of the country. Hamath itself, afterwards Epiphancia on the Orontes, lay far beyond the extremest range of Jewish settlement; nor does it appear that it was ever conquered by the greatest of the Jewish kings. The Hamath in which Solomon built store cities (2 Chronicles 8:4), and the Hamath which Jeroboam II. \"recovered\" for Israel (2 Kings 14:28), was not the city, but the kingdom (or part of the kingdom), of that name. We do not know how far south the territory of Hamath may have extended, but it is quite likely that it included at times the whole upper valley of the Leontes (now the Litany). The \"entrance to Hamath\" then must be looked for at some point, distinctly marked by the natural features of the country, where the traveler from Palestine would enter the territory of Hamath. This point has been usually fixed at the pass through which the Orontes breaks out of its upper valley between Lebanon and anti-Lebanon into the open plain of Hamath. This point, however, is more than sixty miles north of Damascus (which confessedly never belonged to Israel), and nearly a hundred miles north-north-west from Dan. It would require some amount of positive evidence to make it even probable that the whole of the long and narrow valley between Lebanon and anti-Lebanon, widening towards the north, and separated by mountainous and difficult country from the actual settlements of the Jews, was yet Divinely designated as part of their inheritance. No such positive evidence exists, and therefore we are perfectly free to look for \"the entrance to Hamath\" much further to the south. It is evident that the ordinary road from the land of Canaan or from the cities of Phoenicia to Hamath must have struck the valley of the Leontes, have ascended that river to its sources, and crossed the watershed to the upper stream of Orontes. The whole of this road, until it reached the pass already spoken of leading down to the Emesa of after days, and so to Hamath, lay through a narrow valley of which the narrowest part is at the southern end of the modern district of el Bekaa, almost in a straight line between Sidon and Mount Hermon. Here the two ranges approach most nearly to the bed of the Litany (Leontes), forming a natural gate by which the traveler to Hamath must needs have entered from the south. Here then, very nearly in lat. 88° 80', we may reasonably place the \"entrance to Hamath\" so often spoken of, and so escape the necessity of imagining an artificial and impracticable frontier for the northern boundary of the promised land. Zedad. Identified by some with the present village of Sadad or Sudad, to the south-east of Emesa (Hums); but this identification, which is at best very problematic, is wholly out of the question if the argument of the preceding note be accepted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Ziphron. A town called Sibraim is mentioned by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 47:16) as lying on the boundary between Damascus and Hamath, and there is a modern village of Zifran about forty miles north-east of Damascus, but there is no probable ground for supposing that either of these are the Ziphron of this verse. Hazar-enan, i.e., \"fountain court.\" There are of course many places in and about the Lebanon and anti-Lebanon ranges to which such a name would be suitable, but we have no means of identifying it with any one of them. It must be confessed that this \"north border\" of Israel is extremely obscure, because we are not told whence it started, nor can we fix, except by conjecture, one single point upon it. A certain amount of light is thrown upon the subject by the description of the tribal boundaries and possessions as given in Joshua 19, and by the enumeration of places left unconquered in Joshua 13 and Judges 3. The most northerly of the tribes were Asher and Naphtali, and it does not appear that their allotted territory extended beyond the lower valley of the Leontes where it makes its sharp turn towards the west. It is true that a portion of the tribe of Dan afterwards occupied a district further north, but Dan-Laish itself, which was the extreme of Jewish settlement in this direction, as Beersheba in the other, was southward of Mount Hermon. The passage in Joshua 13:4-6 does indeed go to prove that the Israelites never occupied all their intended territory in this direction, but as far as we can tell the line of promised conquest did not extend further north than alden and Mount Hermon. \"All Lebanon toward the sunrising\" cannot well mean the whole range from south to north, but all the mountain country lying to the east of Zidon. One other passage promises to throw additional light upon the question, viz., the ideal delimitation of the Holy Land in Ezekiel 47; and here it is true that we find a northern frontier (verses 15-17) apparently far beyond the line of actual settlement, and yet containing two names at least (Zedad and Hazar-enan) which appear in the present list. It is, however, quite uncertain whether the prophet is describing any possible boundary line at all, or whether he is only mentioning(humanly speaking at random)certain points in the far north; his very object would seem to be to picture an enlarged Canaan extending beyond its utmost historical limits. Even if it should be thought that these passages require a frontier further to the north than the one advocated above, it will yet be impossible to carry it to the northern end of the valley between Lebanon and anti-Lebanon. For in that case the northern frontier will not be a northern frontier at all, but will actually descend from the \"entrance of Hamath\" in a southerly or south-westerly direction, and distinctly form part of the eastern boundary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shepham is unknown. Riblah cannot possibly be the Riblah in the land of Hamath (Jeremiah 39:5), now apparently Ribleh on the Orontes. This one example will serve to show how delusive are these identifications with modern places. Even if Ribleh represents an ancient Riblah, it is not the Riblah which is mentioned here. On the east side of Ain, i.e., of the fountain. The Targums here imply that this Ain was the source of Jordan below Mount Hermon, and that would agree extremely well with what follows. The Septuagint has ἐπὶ πηγάς, and there is in fact more than one fountain from which this head-water of Jordan takes its rise. Immediately before the Septuagint has Βηλά where we read Riblah. It has been supposed that the word was originally Ἀρβηλά, a transliteration of \"Har-bel,\" the mountain of Bel or Baal, identical with the Harbaal-Hermon (our Mount Hermon) of Judges 3:3. The Hebrew הָרִבְלָה being differently pointed, and the final ה taken as the suffix of direction, we get הָר־בֵל; but this is extremely precarious. Shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward. Literally, \"shall strike (מָחָה) the shoulder of the sea,\" &c. The line does not seem to have descended the stream from its source, but to have kept to the east, and so to have struck the lake of Galilee at its north-eastern corner. From this point it simply followed the water-way down to the Salt Sea. The lands beyond Jordan were not reckoned as within the sacred limits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - On this side Jordan near Jericho. Literally, \"on the side (מֵעֵבֶר) of the Jordan of Jericho.\" It was not of course true that the territory which they had received lay eastward of Jericho, but it was the case that the tribe leaders had there asked and received permission to occupy that territory, and it was in this direction that the temporary settlements of Reuben and Gad lay, perhaps also those of half Manasseh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

This was arranged no doubt in order to insure fairness in fixing the boundaries between the tribes, which had to be done after the situation of the tribe was determined by lot; the further subdivision of the tribal territory was probably left to be managed by the chiefs of the tribe itself. Of these tribe princes (see on Numbers 13:1; Joshua 14:1), Caleb is the only one whose name is known to us, and he had acted in a somewhat similar capacity forty years before. This may of itself account for the tribe of Judah being named first in the list, especially as Reuben was not represented; but the order in which the other names follow is certainly remarkable. Taken in pairs (Judah and Simeon, Manasseh and Ephraim, &c.), they advance regularly from south to north, according to their subsequent position on the map. Differing as this arrangement does so markedly from any previously adopted, it is impossible to suppose that it is accidental. We must conclude either that a coincidence so apparently trivial was Divinely prearranged, or that the arrangement of the names is due to a later hand than that of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Shemuel.

This legislation forms the natural sequel and complement of the Divine decrees already promulgated concerning the Levites. Separated from the rest of the tribes from the time of the first census (Numbers 1:49), excluded from any tribal inheritance (Numbers 18:20), but endowed with tithes and offerings for their maintenance (Numbers 18:21, &c.), it was also necessary that they should be provided with homes for themselves and their cattle. They might indeed have been left to exist as they could, and where they could, upon the provision made for them in the law. But, on the one hand, that provision was itself precarious, depending as it did upon the piety and good feeling of the people (which must often have been found wanting: cf. Nehemiah 13:10; Malachi 3:8, 9); and, on the other, it is evident that the Levites were intended, as far as their family and social life was concerned, to share the ordinary comforts and enjoyments of Israelites. Nothing could have been more foreign to the Mosaic ideal than a ministry celibate, ascetic, and detached from this world's wealth, such as readily enough sprang up (whether intended or not) under the teaching of the gospel (cf. Luke 10:4; Luke 12:33; Acts 20:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 7:7, 25, 26; 1 Corinthians 9:18, 27; 2 Corinthians 6:10; 2 Timothy 2:4). Suburbs. The Hebrew word מִגְרָשׁ undoubtedly means here a pasture, or a paddock, an enclosed place outside the town into which the cattle were driven by day to feed. It is possible that the A.V. may have used the word \"suburbs\" in that sense. To keep cattle to some extent was not only a universal custom, but was well-nigh a necessity of life in that age.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For their cattle. לִבְהֶמְתָּם, \"for their great cattle,\" i.e., oxen, camels, and any other beasts of draught or burden. For their goods. \"For their possessions,\" which in this connection would mean their ordinary \"live stock,\" chiefly sheep and goats; the word itself (לִרְכוּשָׁם) is indeterminate. For all their beasts. לְכֹל־חַיָּתָם an expression which apparently only sums up what has previously been mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Ye shall measure from without the city (מִחוּצ לָעִיר - ἔξω τῆς πόλεως)... two thousand cubits. These directions are very obscure. Some have held that the country for 1000 cubits beyond the walls was reserved for pasture (according to verse 4), and for another 1000 cubits for fields and vineyards, so that the Levitical lands extended 2000 cubits in all directions. This is reasonable in itself, since 2000 cubits is only half a mile, and rather more than a square mile of land would not seem too much for pastures, gardens, &c. for a town with at least 1000 inhabitants. The smallest tribe territories seem to have comprised some 300 square miles of country; and if we take the Levitical towns as averaging 1000 cubits square, their forty-eight cities would only give them seventy-three square miles of territory. There is, however, no notice of anything being given to the Levites except their \"suburbs,\" so that this explanation must be at best very doubtful. Others have argued for a plan according to which each outer boundary, drawn at 1000 cubits' distance from the wall, would measure 2000 cubits, plus the length of the town wall; but this is far too artificial, and could only be considered possible as long as it was confined to a paper sketch, for it presupposes that each city lay four-square, and faced the four points of the compass. If the first explanation be untenable, the only alternative sufficiently simple and natural is to suppose that, in order to avoid irregularities of measurement, each outer boundary was to be drawn at an approximate distance of 1000 cubits from the wall, and each of an approximate length of 2000 cubits; at the angles the lines would have to be joined as best they might. In Leviticus 25:32-34 certain regulations are inserted in favour of the Levites. Their houses might be redeemed at any time, and not only within the full year allowed to others; moreover, they returned to them (contrary to the general rule) at the year of Jubilee. Their property in the \"suburbs\" they could not sell at all, for it was inalienable. It is difficult to believe that these regulations were really made at Mount Sinai, presupposing, as they do, the legislation of this chapter; but if they were actually made at this time, on the eve of the conquest, it is easy to see why they were subsequently inserted in the chapter which deals generally with the powers of sale and redemption.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And among the cities. Rather, \"and the cities.\" וְאֶת הֶעָרים - καὶ τὰς πόλεις. The construction is broken, or rather is continuous throughout verses 6-8, the accusative being repeated. Six cities for refuge. See below on verse 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Forty and eight cities. The Levites numbered nearly 50,000 souls (see on Numbers 26:62), so that each Levitical city would have an average population of about 1000 to start with. There seems no sufficient reason for supposing that they shared their towns with men of the surrounding tribe. Even if the provision made for their habitation was excessive at first (which does not appear), yet their rate of increase should have been exceptionally high, inasmuch as they were not liable to military service. It is possible that mystical reasons led to the selection of the number forty-eight (12 x 4, both typical of universality), but it is at least equally probable that it was determined by the actual numbers of the tribe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the cities which ye shall give shall be, &c. Rather, \"And as to the cities which ye shall give from the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall multiply, and from the few ye shall decrease.\" What seems to be a general rule of proportionate giving is laid down here, but it was not carried out, and it is not easy to see how it could have been. From the large combined territory of Judah and Simeon nine cities were indeed surrendered (Joshua 21), but all the rest, great and small, gave up four apiece, except Naphtali, which gave up three only. As the territory of Naphtali was apparently large in proportion to its numbers, this was probably for no other reason than that the tribe stood last on the list. Every one. Hebrew, אִישׁ. It was in fact each tribe that surrendered so many cities, but since the tribal inheritance was the joint property of all the tribesmen, every man felt that he was a party to the gift. No doubt it was the Divine intention to foster in the tribes as far as possible this local feeling of interest and property in the Levites who dwelt among them (compare the expression \"their scribes and Pharisees\" in Luke 5:30). The dispersion of the Levites (however mysteriously connected with the prophecy of Genesis 49:5-7) was obviously designed to form a bond of unity for all Israel by diffusing the knowledge and love of the national religion, and by keeping up a constant communication between the future capital and all the provinces. According to the Divine ideal Israel as a whole was \"the election\" (ἡ ἐκλογή) from all the earth, the Levites were the ἐκλογή of Israel, and the priests the ἐκλογή of Levi. The priestly family was at present too small to be influential, but the Levites were numerous enough to have leavened the whole nation if they had walked worthy of their calling. They were gathered together in towns of their own, partly no doubt in order to avoid disputes, but partly that they might have a better opportunity of setting forth the true ideal of what Jewish life should be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you. God had already announced that he would appoint a place whither one guilty of unpremeditated manslaughter might flee for safety (Exodus 21:18). The expression there used does not point to more than one \"place,\" but it is not inconsistent with several. Probably the right of sanctuary has been recognized from the earliest times in which any local appropriation of places to sacred purposes has been made. It is an instinct of religion to look upon one who has escaped into a sacred enclosure as being under the personal protection of the presiding deity. It is certain that the right was largely recognized in Egypt, where the priestly caste was so powerful and ambitious; and this is no doubt the reason (humanly speaking) for the promise in Exodus 21:13, and for the command in the following verse. Inasmuch as the whole of Canaan was the Lord's, any places within it might he endowed with rights of sanctuary, but it was obviously suitable that they should be Levitical cities; the Divine prerogative of mercy could nowhere be better exercised, nor would any citizens be better qualified to pronounce and to uphold the rightful decision in each case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - From the avenger. Hebrew, גֹאֵל. Septuagint, ὁ ἀγχιστεύων τὸ αῖμα. In all other passages (twelve in number) where the word occurs in this sense it is qualified by the addition \"of blood.\" Standing by itself, it is everywhere else translated \"kinsman,\" or (more properly) \"redeemer,\" and is constantly applied in that sense to God our Saviour (Job 19:25; Isaiah 63:16 &c.). The two ideas, however, which seem to us so distinct, and even so opposed, are in their origin one. To the men of the primitive age, when public justice was not, and when might was right, the only protector was one who could and would avenge them of their wrongs, and by avenging prevent their repetition. This champion of the injured individual, or rather family, - for rights and wrongs were thought of as belonging to families rather than to individuals, was their goel, who had their peace, their safety, above all, their honour, in his charge. For no sentiments spring up quicker, and none exercise a more tyrannous sway, than the sentiment of honour, which in its various and often strangely distorted forms has always perhaps outweighed all other considerations in the minds of men. Now the earliest form in which the sentiment of honour asserted itself was in the blood-feud. If one member of a family was slain, an intolerable shame and sense of contumely rested upon the family until blood had been avenged by blood, until \"satisfaction\" had been done by the death of the manslayer. He who freed the family from this intolerable pain and humiliation - who enabled it to hold up its head, and to breathe freely once more - was the goel; and in the natural order of things he was the nearest \"kinsman\" of the slain who could and would take the duty upon him. To these natural feelings was added in many cases a religious sentiment which regarded homicide as a sin against the higher Powers for which they too demanded the blood of the guilty. Such was the feeling among the Greeks, and probably among the Egyptians, while among the Hebrews it could plead Divine sanction, given in the most comprehensive terms: \"Your blood of your lives will I require, at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man;... whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed\" (Genesis 9:5, 6). The moral difficulties of this proclamation need not here be considered; it is enough to take note that the Divine law itself recognized the duty as well as the lawfulness of private blood-revenge when public justice could not be depended on. The goel, therefore, was not merely the natural champion of his family, nor only the deliverer who satisfied the imperious demands of an artificial code of honour; he was a minister of God, in whose patient efforts to hunt down his victim the thirst for vengeance was to some extent at least superseded by, or rather transmuted into, the longing to glorify God (compare the difficult case of Revelation 6:10). It was not merely human feelings of great reach and tenacity which were outraged by the immunity of the manslayer; it was still more the justice of God which received a grievous wound. Just because, however, God had made the cause of the slain man his own, and had sanctioned the avenging mission of the goel, he could therefore regulate the course of vengeance so as to make it run as even as possible with true justice. It was not indeed possible to distinguish ab initio between the homicide which deserved and that which did not deserve capital punishment. Such distinction, difficult under any circumstances, was impossible when vengeance was in private hands. But while the goel could not be restrained from immediate pursuit unhindered by investigation or compunction (lest his whole usefulness be paralyzed), the manslayer might have opportunity to escape, and to be sheltered under the Divine mercy until he could establish (if that were possible) his innocence. No better instance can be found of the way in which the King of Israel adopted the sentiments and institutions of a semi-barbarous age, added to them the sanctions of religion, and so modified them as to secure the maximum of practical good consistent with the social state and moral feelings of the people. No doubt many an individual was overtaken and slain by the goel who did. not deserve to die according to our ideas; but where perfection was unattainable, this error was far less dangerous to that age than the opposite error of diminishing the sanctity of human life and the awfulness of Divine justice. The congregation. Hebrew, עֵדָה. This word is used frequently from Exodus 12:3 to the end of this chapter, and again in Joshua and the last two chapters of Judges. It is not found in Deuteronomy, nor often in the later books. In every case apparently eydah signifies the whole nation as gathered together, e.g., as represented by all who had an acknowledged right to appear, for of course 600,000 men could not gather together in any one place. The force of the word may be understood by reference to its use in Judges 20:1; Judges 21:10, 13, 16. Another word (קָהָל) is also used, less frequently in Leviticus and Numbers, but more frequently in the later books, for the general assembly of the people of Israel. No distinction of meaning can be drawn between the two words, and it cannot, therefore, be maintained that the \"congregation\" of this verse means the local elders of Joshua 20:4. The regulations there laid down are not inconsistent with the present law, but are quite independent of it. They refer to a preliminary hearing of the case as stated by the fugitive alone in order to determine his right to shelter in the mean time; which right, if accorded, was without prejudice to the future judgment of the \"congregation\" on the whole facts of the case (see below on verse 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Six cities. See on Deuteronomy 19:8, 9, where three more are apparently ordered to be set aside upon a certain contingency:NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan. According to Deuteronomy 4:41-43. Moses himself severed these three cities, Bezer of the Reubenites, Ramoth of the Gadites, and Golan of the Manassites. Those verses, however, seem to be an evident interpolation where they stand, and are hardly consistent with previous statements if taken literally. It is tolerably clear that the two tribes had only formed temporally settlements hitherto, and that their boundaries were not defined as yet; also that the Levitical cities (to which the cities of refuge were to belong) were not separated until after the conquest. It is likely that Deuteronomy 4:41-43 is a fragment, the real meaning el which is that Moses ordered the severance of three cities on that side Jordan as cities of refuge, for which purposes the three cities mentioned were afterwards selected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - With an instrument of iron. There is no reasonable doubt that בַּרְיֶל has here (as elsewhere) its proper meaning of iron. The expression must be held to include both weapons and other instruments; the former may have been mostly made of bronze, but where iron is used at all it is sure to be employed in war.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - With throwing a stone, wherewith he may die.

A club, or other such formidable instrument.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - When he meeteth him, i.e., outside a city of refuge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But if. Rather, \"and if\" (וְאִם). The consideration of willful murder is continued in these two verses, although chiefly with reference to the motive. It is to be understood that the deliberate intent was present in the former cases, and a new case is added, viz., if he smite him with his fist with fatal consequences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Without enmity.... without laying of wait. These expressions seem intended to limit mercy to cases of pure accident, such as that quoted in Deuteronomy 19:5. Neither provocation nor any other \"extenuating circumstances\" are taken into account, nor what we now speak of as absence of premeditation. The want of these finer distinctions, as well as the short and simple list of farm injuries given, show the rudeness of the age for which these regulations were made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The congregation (עֵדָה) shall restore him to the city of his refuge. It is perfectly plain from this (and from Joshua 20:6) that the general assembly of all Israel was to summon both homicide and avenger before them with their witnesses, and, if they found the accused innocent, were to send him back under safe escort to the city in which he had taken refuge. He shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest. No doubt his family might join him in his exile, and his life might be fairly happy as well as safe within certain narrow limits; but under ordinary circumstances he must forfeit much and risk more by his enforced absence from home and land. It is not easy to see why the death of the high priest should have set the fugitive free from the law of vengeance, except as foreshadowing the death of Christ. No similar significance is anywhere else attributed to the death of the high priest; and it was rather in its unbroken continuance than in its recurring interruption that the priesthood of Aaron typified that of the Redeemer. To see anything of a vicarious or satisfactory character in the death of the high priest seems to be introducing an element quite foreign to the symbolism of the Old Testament. The stress, however, which is laid upon the fact of his decease (cf. verse 28), and the solemn notice of his having been anointed with the holy oil, seem to point unmistakably to something in his official and consecrated character which made it right that the rigour of the law should die with him. What the Jubilee was to the debtor who had lost his property, that the death of the high priest was to the homicide who had lost his liberty. If it was the case, as commonly believed, that all blood feuds were absolutely terminated by the death of the high priest, might this not be because the high priest, as chief minister of the law of God, was himself the goel of the whole nation? When he died all processes of' vengeance lapsed, because they had really been commenced in his name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Without the border of the city, i.e., no doubt beyond its \"suburbs.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - By the mouth of witnesses, i.e., of two at least (cf. Deuteronomy 17:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer. The passion for vengeance is both bad and good, and is therefore to be carefully purified and restrained; but when the desire for vengeance can be appeased by a money payment, it has become wholly bad, and is only a despicable form of covetousness which insults the justice it pretends to invoke. Such payments or \"ransoms\" are permitted by the Koran, and have been common among most semi-civilized peoples, notably amongst our old English ancestors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - That he should come again to dwell in the land. No one might buy off the enmity of the avenger before the appointed time, for that would give an unjust advantage to wealth, and would make the whole matter mercenary and vulgar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The land cannot be cleansed. Literally, \"there is no expiation (יְכֻפַר) for the land.\" Septuagint, οὐχ ἐξιλασθήσεται ἡ γῆ. By these expressions the Lord places the sin of murder in its true light, as a sin against himself. The land, his land, is defiled with the blood of the slain, and nothing can do away with the guilt which cleaves to it but the strict execution of Divine justice upon the murderer. Money might satisfy the relatives of the slain, but cannot satisfy his Maker.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers35:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDefile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - For I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel. Therefore the murderer's hand is raised against me; the blood of the slain is ever before my eyes, its cry for vengeance ever in my ears (cf. Genesis 4:10; Matthew 23:35; Revelation 6:10).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.36":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The chief fathers. The same phrase is more correctly translated in Exodus 6:25 \"heads of the fathers.\" It is, however, probable that הָאָבור (fathers) is a contraction for בֵּית־הַאָבות (fathers' houses). The fathers' house was the next recognized and familiar division below the mishpachah (family). Probably the fathers' house included originally all the descendants of a living ancestor, who formed the bond of union between them; but this union no doubt survived in many cases the death of the common ancestor, whose authority would then devolve upon the oldest efficient member of the house. The families of the children of Gilead. \"The mishpachoth of the Beni-Gilead\" certainly did not include the Machirites, who were somewhat sharply distinguished from the other Manassites (see above on Numbers 26:29; 32:39 ff.); it is even doubtful whether they included the Gileadites proper, who took their name (and perhaps traced their descent) from Gilead, but not from his sons. It may be confidently assumed that the Machirites, who had received an extensive and remote territory beyond Jordan, had nothing whatever to do with this application. It was the other section of the tribe, the mishpachoth of the six sons of Gilead, who were yet to receive inheritance by lot in Canaan proper, to whom the matter appeared so serious that they came to Moses about it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - My lord. אֲדֹנִי. The singular form is constantly used in Hebrew, as in other languages, together with the plural personal pronoun (see at Genesis 23:6). The deference now paid to Moses (cf. chapter Numbers 32:25, 27) is in marked contrast to the treatment he had received from the former generation. Only Aaron (and that under the influence of terror - Exodus 32:22; Numbers 12:11) and Joshua (Joshua 11:28) had addressed him as Adoni before.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Whereunto they are received. Literally, as in the margin, \"unto whom (לָהֶם referring to the men of the tribe) they shall be.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be. It is remarkable that this is the only reference by name to the Jubilee (יובֵל, jubeel; not jubilee, which is the vulgar form of the same word derived from the Latin jubiheus) to be found in the Scriptures. Some allusions more or less doubtful have been pointed out in the prophets, but the only one which seems incontrovertible is in Ezekiel 46:17, and belongs to the ideal regime of that vision. Jeremiah's right of redemption over the lands of his family was probably due to the fact that they were priestly lands (Joshua 21:18; Jeremiah 1:1; Jeremiah 32:7-9), and as such incapable of permanent alienation. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the Jubilee was ever actually observed, although the principle upon which it rested, the equity of redemption which no Israelite could divest himself of, was undoubtedly acknowledged (see notes on Leviticus 25). Then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received. It is again remarkable that the one explicit reference to the Jubilee should be only to an indirect consequence of its practical working. The Jubilee could not really transfer the property of the heiress to her husband's tribe, but it would in effect confirm that transfer, and make it permanent. In practice no property would be considered to have finally changed hands until the year of Jubilee, when an extensive re-settlement took place, and when all titles not successfully challenged would be considered as confirmed. Since the title of the heiress's children could not be challenged, and since any intermediate disposition of the land must then determine, the Jubilee would seem to effect the transfer of which it compelled the recognition. It is, however, none the less strange that the Manassites should have laid such stress upon the practical effects of a piece of legislation which had never yet come into use. It seems to point to the conclusion that the same thing had been customary among them in their Egyptian homes, and that they were acquainted, at least by tradition, with its actual working.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The tribe of the sons of Joseph. \"The tribe (matteh) of the Beni-Joseph.\" There were two, or rather in effect three, tribes of the Beni-Joseph; Moses referred, of course, to the one which had come before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. The direction is not altogether plain, since the tribe (matteh) contained several families (mishpachoth), and in this case one or more of the families were widely separated from the rest. Probably the words are to be read, \"only to the tribe-family of their father,\" i.e., only into that mishpachah of Manasseh to which their father had belonged. Practically, therefore, they were restricted to the family of the Hepherites (Numbers 26:32, 33). This is made almost certain when we remember that the territory of the \"family\" was to be apportioned within the tribe in the same way, and with the same regard to relationship, as the territory of the tribe within the nation (see on Numbers 33:54).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Every one... shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. This was to be the general rule which governed all such questions. Every Israelite had his own share in the inheritance of his tribe, and with that he was to be content, and not seek to intrude on other tribes. Accordingly the decision in the case of the daughters of Zelophehad is extended to all similar cases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Mahlah, &c. It is a curious instance of the inartificial character of the sacred records that these five names, which have not the least interest in themselves, are repeated thrice in this Book, and once in Joshua (Joshua 17:3). It is evident that the case made a deep impression upon the mind of the nation at the time. Their father's brothers' sons. The Hebrew word דּוד is always translated \"father's brother,\" or \"uncle;\" and that seems to be its ordinary meaning, although in Jeremiah 32:12 it stands for uncle's son. There is no reason to depart from the customary reading here. No doubt the daughters of Zelophehad acted according to the spirit as well as the letter of the law, and married the nearest male relatives who were open to their choice. The SeptuagintNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers36:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The commandments, הַמִּצות. This is one of the words which recur so continually in Deuteronomy and in Psalm 119. It is found four times in chapter 15, and in a few other passages of the earlier books, including Leviticus 27:34. The judgments. הַמִּשְׁפָטִים. A similar formula is found at the conclusion of Leviticus (Leviticus 26:46), where, however, \"the commandments\" represents a different word (הַחֻקִּים), and a third term, \"the laws\" (הַתּורֹת), is added. It is difficult to say confidently what is included under the \"these\" of this verse. Comparing it with Numbers 33:50, it would seem that it only referred to the final regulations and enactments of the last four chapters; but as we have no reason to believe that the later sections of the Book are arranged in any methodical order, we cannot limit its scope to those, or deny that it may include the laws of chapters 28-30. For a similar reason we cannot say that the use of this concluding formula excludes the possibility of further large additions having been subsequently made to the Divine legislation in the same place and by the same person, as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy. All we can say is, that the Book of Numbers knows nothing about any such additions, and concludes in such sort as to make it a matter of surprise that such additions are afterwards met with. The continuity, which so clearly binds together the main bulk of the four books of Moses, ends with this verse. This fact does not of course decide any question which arises concerning the fifth book; it merely leaves all such questions to be determined on their own merits.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - These... are the generations of Aaron and Moses.

It marks a new departure, looking down, not up, the course of history. Moses and Aaron were a beginning in themselves as the chosen heads of the chosen tribe: Moses having the higher office, but one entirely personal to himself; Aaron being the first of a long and eminent line of priests. The actual genealogy, therefore, is that of Aaron, and he is placed first. In the day.

Septuagint, \"shall keep his watches, and the watches of the children of Israel.\" The Levites were to be the servants of Aaron on the one side, and of the whole congregation on the other, in the performance of their religious duties. The complicated ceremonial now prescribed and set in use could not possibly be carried out by priests or people without the assistance of a large number of persons trained and devoted to the work.

As the whole house of Israel at large, so especially (for a reason which will presently appear) the tribe of Levi belonged absolutely to God; and he, as absolutely, made them over to Aaron and the priests for the service of his sanctuary. Cf. Ephesians 4:11, \"gave some apostles,\" etc. The Levites, as gifts from God (nethunim) to their brethren the priests, must be distinguished from the nethinim or serfs of foreign extraction given by the congregation to the Levites to do their most menial work for them (Joshua 9:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The stranger that cometh nigh.

The separation of the Levites for the ministry of the tabernacle was not to infringe in the least upon the exclusive rights of Aaron and his sons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I have taken the Levites. The actual separation of Levi had been already anticipated (see Numbers 1:47, 53), but the meaning and purpose of that separation is now formally declared, into reason, however, is assigned for the choice of this particular tribe. It is almost always assumed that their zeal in the matter of the golden calf was the ground of the preference shown to them now. But it may be doubted whether there was any \"preference\" in the matter at all. To Aaron and his seed on undoubted and important preference was shown, but the functions and position of the Levites were not such as to give them any preeminence, or to secure them any substantial advantage. They were tied down to the performance of routine duties, which demanded no intelligence, and gave scope for no ambitions. The one obvious reason why Levi was selected is to be found in the fact that he was by far the smallest in numbers among the tribes, being less than half the next smallest, Manasseh, and almost exactly balancing the first-born. A larger tribe could not have been spared, and would not have been needed, for the purpose in question. If any more recondite motive must be sought for the Divine selection, it must be found in the prophecy of Genesis 49:7. Levi as well as Simeon, though in a different way, was doomed never to raise his head as a united and powerful tribe among his brethren.NEWLINENEWLINENumbers 3:13 Verse 13. - Because all the first-born are mine (see Exodus 13:2, and below on verse 43). That the powers of heaven had a special claim upon the firstling of man or beast was probably one of the oldest religious ideas in the world, which it would be difficult to trace to any origin but in some primeval revelation. It branched out into many superstitions, of which the cruel cultus of Moloch was the worst. Among the tribes which preserved the patriarchal faith, it retained more or less of its primitive meaning in the assignment of sacrificial duties to the eldest son. According to the Targums, the \"young men of the children of Israel\" sent by Moses to offer sacrifices before the consecration of Aaron (Exodus 24:5) were first-born. Whatever ancient and latent claims, however, God may have had upon the firstborn of Israel, they are here superseded by a special and recent claim founded upon their miraculous preservation when the first-born of the Egyptians were slain. All the firstborn in that day became \"anathema,\" devoted to God, for evil or for good, for death or for life. He, to whom belongs the whole harvest of human souls, came and claimed his first-fruits from the fields of Egypt. He took unto himself by death the first-born of the Egyptians; he left for himself in life the first-born of the Israelites. For the convenience, however, of the people, and for the better and more regular discharge of the ministry, he was content to take the single small tribe of Levi in lieu of the first-born of all.NEWLINENEWLINENumbers 3:12 Verse 12. - Instead of all the first-born. The Septuagint inserts here, \"they shall be their ransom.\"NEWLINENEWLINENumbers 3:13 Verse 13. - Mine shall they be: I am the Lord. Rather, \"mine shall they be, mine, the Lord's.\"NEWLINENEWLINENumbers 3:15 Verse 15. - From a month old. The first-born were to be redeemed \"from a month old\" (Numbers 18:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNumber the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - These were the sons of Levi.

These directions as to the position and duties of the Levitical families retain the form in which they were originally given. The way in which they are mixed up with direct narrative affords a striking proof of the inartificial character of these sacred writings. Behind the tabernacle westward. The tabernacle opened or looked eastward towards the sunrise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The charge of the sons of Gershon.

The four families of the Kohathites, of which that of Amram was one, must have contained about 18,000 souls. Moses and Aaron were sons of Amram, and they seem to have had but two sons apiece at this time. If, therefore, the family of the Amramites was at all equal in numbers to the other three, they must have had more than 4000 brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces. It is urged in reply that Amram lived 137 years, and may have had many other children, and that the variations in the comparative rates of increase are so great and so unaccountable that it is useless to speculate upon them. There is, however, a more serious difficulty connected with the genealogy of Moses and Aaron, as given here and elsewhere. If they were the great-grandchildren of Levi on their father's side, and his grandchildren on their mother's side, it is impossible to maintain the obvious meaning of Exodus 12:40. Either the genealogy must be lengthened, or the time must be very much shortened for the sojourning in Egypt. The known and undoubted habit of the sacred writers to omit names in their genealogies, even in those which seem most precise, lessens the difficulty of the first alternative, whereas every consideration of numbers, including those in this passage, increases the difficulty of the second. To endeavour to avoid either alternative, and to force the apparent statements of Scripture into accord by assuming a multiplicity of unrecorded and improbable miracles at every turn (as, e.g., that Jochebed, the mother of Moses, was restored to youth and beauty at an extreme old age), is to expose the holy writings to contempt. It is much more reverent to believe, either that the genealogies are very imperfect, or that the numbers in the text have been very considerably altered. Every consideration of particular examples, still more the general impression left by the whole narrative, favours the former as against the latter alternative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Elizaphan the son of Uzziel - of the youngest branch. This may have aroused the jealousy of Korah, who represented an elder branch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Eleazar.

Moses, and Aaron and his sons. The most central and honourable place in the camp, and the most convenient for constant and direct access to the sanctuary. Moses held a wholly personal and exceptional position as king in Jeshurun (Deuteronomy 33:5); Aaron was hereditary high priest. Between them they represented the union of royal and sacerdotal authority, which had many partial continuations in Jewish history, but was fully realized in Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Twenty and two thousand. It is obvious that there is a discrepancy between this total and its three component numbers, which make 22,300. It is so obvious that it must have been innocent; no one deliberately falsifying or forging would have left so palpable a discrepancy on the face of the narrative. It may, therefore, have arisen from an error in transcription (the alteration of a single letter would suffice); or it may be due to the fact that, for some reason not stated, 300 were struck off the Levitical total for the purpose of this census. Such a reason was found by the Hebrew expositors, and has been accepted by some moderns, in the fact that the Levites were taken and counted instead of the first-born, and that, therefore, their own first-born would have to he excluded. There is nothing to be said against this explanation, except that no trace of it appears in a narrative otherwise very full and minute. The first-born of the Levites may have been just 300 (although the number is singularly small), and they may have been considered ineligible for the purpose of redeeming other first-born; but if so, why did not the sacred writer say so, instead of silently reducing the total of \"all that were numbered of the Levites\"?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. These were the first-born of the twelve tribes; but who were included under the designation \"first-born\" is a matter of grave dispute. The smallness of their number (not much above one per cent. of the whole population) has given rise to several conflicting theories, all of which seem to be artificial, arbitrary, and therefore unsatisfactory. It is urged by some that the expression \"every male that openeth the womb\" must be strictly pressed, and that there would be no \"first-born\" in those families (which form a considerable majority) in which either a girl was born first, or the eldest, being a boy, had died. It is further urged that only those first-horn would be counted who were not themselves fathers of families. These considerations will indeed reduce the probable numbers very largely, but not to the required amount. Others, again, give an entirely different turn to the difficulty by urging that as the command in Exodus 13. I was prospective only, so at this time only the first-born since the exodus were counted. This makes it necessary to assume an altogether unprecedented birth-rate during that short period. One other explanation strives to satisfy the arithmetical conditions of the problem by assuming that the whole of the Divine legislation in this matter was in reality directed against the worship of Moloch, and was designed to prevent the offering of first-born to him by redeeming them unto himself. As the rites of Moloch only demanded young children of tender age, only such were counted in this census. It may, indeed, be very probably concluded that their heavenly Father did claim these first-born, partly in order to save them from Moloch, because the people would thereafter be exposed to the fascination of that horrid superstition; but there is no proof whatever that they were acquainted with it at this time. These cruel rites, together with many other heathen abominations, are forbidden in Leviticus 18:21 and Deuteronomy 18:10, in view of the entry into Canaan, where they were practiced. The prophet Amos, when he reproaches them with having \"carried the tabernacle of\" their \"Moloch\" even in the wilderness (Amos 5:26), absolves them by implication from any darker superstition; and the highly rhetorical passage Ezekiel 20:26 seems to refer to the consequences of disobedience at a later date, and can hardly be pressed against the entire silence of the Pentateuch. Anyhow it does not seem possible, on the strength of a supposed intention on the part of God of which no trace appears in the text, to impose a narrow and arbitrary limit upon the plain command to number \"all the first-born, from a month old and upward.\" If we turn from these speculations to the reason and ground of the matter as stated by God himself, it will appear much more simple. It was distinctly on the ground of their preservation from the destroying angel in Egypt that the first-born of Israel were claimed as God's peculium now (see verse 13). The command in Exodus 13:1 was no doubt prospective, but the sanctification of the first-born was based upon the deliverance itself; and this command was intended not to limit that sanctification for the present, but to continue it for the future. Now if we turn to Exodus 12:29, 30, and ask who the first-born were whom the destroying angel cut off, we see plainly enough that they included the eldest son, being a child, in every house; that every family lost one, and only one. On the one hand, Pharaoh himself was in all probability a first-born, but he was not in any personal danger, because he ranked and suffered as a father, not as a son. On the other hand, the majority of families in which the first-born was a daughter, or had died, did not therefore escape: \"there was not a house where there was not one dead.\" Taking this as the only sure ground to go upon, we may conclude with some confidence that the first-born now claimed by God in-eluded all the eldest sons in the families of Israel who were not themselves the heads of houses. These were the destroyed in Egypt - these the redeemed in Israel. How they came to be so few in proportion is a matter in itself of extremely slight importance, and dependant, perhaps, upon causes of which no record was left.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers3:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - Five shekels apiece. This amount had already been fixed (Leviticus 27:6, if indeed this chapter does not belong to a later period as the commutation value of a male child under five years old who had been vowed unto the Lord. If the redeeming of the first-born by the Levites began with the eldest, those that were left over would all be within this age. A shekel.

The Levites were given to Aaron in lieu of the first-born. As, however, their number fell somewhat short, the redemption money taken for the remainder was due to Aaron as compensation, and was doubtless applied to the support of the tabernacle worship.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINETHE DUTIES OF THE LEVITES (chapter 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take the sum of the sons of Kohath. The Levites having been separated from the other tribes, the Kohathites are now to be separated from amongst the other Levites for the most honourable and sacred duties. To them the preference was given presumably because the priests were Kohathites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - From thirty years old and upward. The age at which they became liable for service was shortly after reduced to twenty-five (Numbers 8:24), and at a later period to twenty (1 Chronicles 23:27). In the wilderness a larger number of the men might be required to attend to their own camps, and their own families; but the explanation may probably be found in the unusually large proportion who were at this time between the ages of thirty and fifty. The Septuagint has altered thirty into twenty-five to make it agree with Numbers 8:24. Thirty years became among the Jews the perfect age at which a man attained to full maturity, and entered upon all his fights and duties (cf. Luke 3:23). Into the host. Not the military ranks, but the militia sacra of the Lord. To do the work.

Probably of sea-cow skins (tachash), but see Exodus 25:5. The Targum of Palestine, and the Septuagint, both render it \"a covering of hyacinthine skin.\" The later Jews would have no knowledge of the marine animals common on the shores of the Red Sea. A cloth wholly of blue. This was the distinctive outer, and therefore Visible, covering of the most sacred thing, the ark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal. Rather, \"the plates, the bowls, the wine pitchers, and the chalices for pouring out,\" i.e., the drink offerings. The two first seem to have been used in the meat offering, the two last in the drink offering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Shall put in the staves thereof. This formula is repeated alike with reference to the ark, the table, and the two altars. It would therefore be natural to suppose that the staves had all been taken out while the various coverings were put on. On the other hand, it is expressly directed in Exodus 25:15 that the staves of the ark shall \"not be taken from it.\" Two explanations are possible. Either the former command does not contemplate the necessity of wrapping up the ark, and only applies to all times when it was at rest, or in movement; or else the latter direction only means, in the case of the ark, that the staves should be adjusted for the purpose of bearing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Snuff-dishes. Some render this word \"extinguishers,\" but it could hardly bear that meaning, since it also signifies censers in chapter Numbers 16:6, and fire-pans in Exodus 27:3. They were evidently shallow metal pans available for many different purposes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Upon a bar - i.e., a bearing-frame.

These do not seem to be, at any rate exclusively, the vessels pertaining to the golden altar. They are not packed up with it, but separately, in a blue cloth and a skin covering of their own. Probably they include all the vessels and utensils used inside the tabernacle which have not been previously mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Take away the ashes. This is omitted by the Septuagint. The Hebrew word for \"ashes is of somewhat doubtful meaning, being only used here and in Exodus 27:3; Psalm 20:3 (see margin). Being connected with the word \"fat,\" it may perhaps mean the grease or dripping from the burnt offerings. The Targum of Palestine renders it \"cinders.\" As the altar was hollow, and was filled with earth or stones when used, there would be no need to cleanse it from ashes; if this be the meaning of the word, the command would rather have been to collect the living embers before the altar was removed, in order to keep alive the sacred fire. That this fire was never allowed to go out may be looked upon as certain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.

One thing which the Kohathites almost certainly had to carry is omitted here, possibly because it was carried without any cover at all, and was not regarded as of equal sanctity with the rest. Anyhow, the omission is very remarkable, and may have been accidental. It is supplied by the Septuagint and the Samaritan text in the following addition to verse 14: \"And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot, and they shall put it into a hyacinthine cover of skin, and put it on bars.\" The burdens of the Kohathites were six, not counting the laver and its foot:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the ark;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the table of shewbread;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the candelabrum;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the golden altar;NEWLINENEWLINE(5) \"instruments of ministry;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(6) the frame of the brazen altar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To the office of Eleazar,... oversight.

On him was laid the oversight of and the responsibility for all the material appliances of Divine worship, and in especial it devolved upon him to see to the oil, the incense, and the chrism, and the materials for the daily meat offering. No doubt it is intended, although not precisely expressed, that the Kohathites were specially under his orders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites. The word tribe (shebet) is used in an unusual way here, not in the sense of tribus, but of stirps. Perhaps as Levi was himself a microcosm of all Israel, so his families ranked as tribes; and no doubt they remained more distinct than the families of any other tribe. The meaning of the command is plainly this, \"Take care that the Kohathites are not cut off through any negligence or want of consideration on your part; and the form of the command, \"cut ye not off,\" conveyed most emphatically the warning, that if any mischief befell the Kohathites which the priests could have prevented, they would be responsible for it in the sight of God. No doubt, as a fact, the Kohathites would take their cue from the conduct of the priests: if they were irreverent and careless, the Levites would be the same, and would sooner or later presume, and, presuming, would die.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thus do unto them, i.e., exactly as commanded in verses 5-15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered. This translation is disputed. The word rendered \"are covered\" is the Piel infinitive from bala, to swallow, and so to destroy. It may signify the extreme rapidity with which the most holy things were hidden from sight and removed from touch, so as to become, as it were, non-existent for the time. So the Syriac, Arabic, Samaritan, and the Targums of Onkelos and Palestine. On the other hand, it may be a proverbial expression, \"in a swallow, at a gulp,\" i.e., \"for an instant,\" as in Job 7:19. And so the Septuagint, ἐξάπινα, and most modern scholars. Whichever way, however, we take it, the phrase, \"they shall not go in to see,\" seems to limit the prohibition under pain of death to the deliberate act of entering the tabernacle out of curiosity during the process of packing up the holy things. The case of the men of Bethshemesh, therefore (1 Samuel 6:19), does not fall within the letter of this law, although it does within its spirit. The command, thus limited, is no doubt an addition to the previous command not to touch, but it is altogether in keeping with it. If it was the will of God to hedge about these sacred symbols of his presence and his worship with an awful sanctity, it is obvious that he was as much bound to defend them against the irreverent prying of the eye as against the irreverent touch of the hand; and the prying here prohibited would have been distinctly willful and inexcusable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They shall bear the curtains, etc. For these four coverings, of tapestry, of goats' hair, of rams' skins, and of sea-cow skin respectively, see Exodus 26. In addition to these, the Gershonites carried all the hangings belonging to the tabernacle and to the outer court, with the single exception of the \"veil\" which was wrapped round the ark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And their cords, and all the instruments of their service. Taking this verse in connection with verse 37, we must understand the word \"their\" as applying to the things mentioned in the previous verse. The Merarites carried the cords, &c. of the hangings of the court.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Under the hand of Ithamar, as also were the Merarites. He had been already engaged in overseeing the construction of the tabernacle (Exodus 38:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - This is the charge of their burden, viz., all the solid parts of the fabric of the tabernacle and its court; by far the heaviest burden, and so allotted to the largest number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - By name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden. This injunction only occurs here. The Septuagint has \"number them by name, and all the articles borne by them.\" Perhaps the solid parts of the fabric were numbered for convenience of setting up, and, therefore, were assigned each to its own bearer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven those that were numbered of them after their families, were three thousand and two hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the house of their fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Those that were numbered of them were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore. The census of each family is described in the same form of words with much particularity. No doubt it was carried out with extreme solicitude, as made for a purpose especially sacred and important. The results are remarkable in more ways than one. The following table presents the numbers in each family above one month, and between the ages of thirty and fifty. Kohath, 86002750percent 32NEWLINEGershon, 75002630 35NEWLINEMerari, 62003200 5122,800858038The first conclusion which naturally arises from these figures is, that after all the numbering must have been made by tens, and not by individuals. As it was impossible that 3000 persons could be employed in carrying the various portions of the tabernacle, it may be that each group of ten undertook a unit of responsibility. The second consideration is, that the average of men between thirty and fifty in all Levi is higher than modern statistics show (it is said to be twenty-five per cent. now in the whole population), although not very materially. The third is, that this average is very unequally distributed, rising to a most remarkable proportion in the case of Merari. It is quite clear that something must have disturbed the relative numbers as between the Merarites and the other families. It has been suggested that the small number of male Levites generally, and the small number of male Kohathites, between thirty and fifty especially, may have been caused by heavy losses incurred in carrying out the Divine sentence upon the worshippers of the golden calf (Exodus 32). But -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The slow increase of Levi continued to be very observable down to the time of David; while the other tribes grew from 600,000 to 1,300,000, he only increased to 38,000 (1 Chronicles 23:3).NEWLINENEWLINE2. The average of males over thirty is already higher among the Kohathites than might have been expected; it is the largeness of the number, not the smallness, which needs to be explained.NEWLINENEWLINE3. It is Merari, and not Kohath, that is markedly distinguished from the other two: there is little difference between Kohath and Gershon. It is evident that something must have happened to the tribe of Levi, and in especial to the family of Merari, to reduce very greatly the number of births within the last thirty years. We do not know what the causes were, or why they should have pressed much more heavily on one tribe, or one family, than on another; but it is easy to see that many such causes may have acted, and acted unequally, under the cruel tyranny of Pharaoh. The children may have been systematically slaughtered, or marriages may have largely ceased, while Moses was in the land of Midian. If this were generally the case, it would much diminish the estimated total of the nation, and still more the estimated difficulties of the march.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers4:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Thus were they numbered of him. Literally, \"and his mustering.\" It may have the meaning given to it in the A.V. (and so the Septuagint and Targums), or it may be translated \"mustered things,\" i.e., things assigned to him in the mustering, and read with the previous words, \"Every one to his service, and to his burden, and his mustered things.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINETHE UNCLEAN TO BE REMOVED (verses 1-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommand the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Every leper. The law of the leper had been given in great detail in Leviticus 13 and 14, and it had been already ordered that he should be put out of the camp (Leviticus 13:46, and cf. 14:3). Every one that hath an issue. These defilements are treated of in Leviticus 15; where, however, it is not expressly ordered that those so polluted should be put out of the camp. Whosoever is defiled by the dead. The fact of being thus defiled is recognized in Leviticus 11:24; Leviticus 21:1, but the formal regulations concerning it are not given until Numbers 19:21. Probably the popular opinion and practice was sufficiently definite to explain the present command.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - That they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell. Cleanliness, decency, and the anxious removal even of unwitting pollutions were things due to God himself, and part of the awful reverence to be paid to his presence in the midst of Israel. It is of course easy to depreciate the value of such outward cleanness, as compared with inward; but when we consider the frightful prevalence of filthiness in Christian countriesNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of person and dress,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) of talk,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) of habit in respect of things not so much sinful as uncleanly,NEWLINENEWLINEwe may indeed acknowledge the heavenly wisdom of these regulations, and the incalculable value of the tone of mind engendered by them. With the Jews \"cleanliness\" was not \"next to godliness,\" it was part of godliness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - So did the children of Israel. It is difficult to form any estimate of the numbers thus separated; if we may judge at all from the prevalence of such defilements (especially those under the second head) now, it must have seriously aggravated both the labour and the difficulty of the march. Here was a trial of their faith.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:8-10 EXPOSITION. RESTITUTION TO BE MADE FOR TRESPASSES (verses 5-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Shall commit any sin that men commit. Literally, \"[one] of all the transgressions of men,\" i.e., the wrongs current amongst men. To do a trespass against the Lord. This qualifies the former expression, and restricts its reference to the sins mentioned in Leviticus 6:2, 8, 5, viz., wrongs done to the property of another. Such wrongs, perhaps because they were considered legitimate as long as they were not found out, were taken up by the Lord himself as involving a trespass against his own righteousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - If the man have no kinsman. No goel, or personal representative. This supposes that the wronged man himself is dead, and it is an addition to the law of restitution as given in Leviticus 6, an addition clearly necessary to its completeness. The wrong-doer must in no case be the gainer by his own wrong, and if the trespass could not be \"recompensed\" to man, it must be \"recompensed\" to the Lord, who was as it were joint-plaintiff in the cause. To the priest. On the general principle that the priest was the visible representative of the invisible majesty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Every offering. Hebrew, terumah, heave offering (Exodus 29:28). Septuagint, ἀπαρχὴ. Those offerings, or portions of offerings, which were not consumed on the altar, but \"presented\" at the altar. Having been offered, they were the property of the Lord, and were given by him to the priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Every man's hallowed things. Dedicatory offerings, such as first-fruits, not exactly of the nature of sacrifices. His, i.e., the priest's. Whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his. A general principle, including and confirming the previous rules; subject, of course, to the other and greater principle, that whatever the Lord claimed for himself by fire must first be consumed. These directions concerning the rights of the priests to offerings are very often repeated in various connections. There was probably a strong tendency amongst the people to cheat the priests of their dues, or to represent their claims as exorbitant. It is in the spirit of covetousness which underlies all such conduct that we are to find the connection between these two verses and the rest of the paragraph.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:12-27 THE TRIAL OF JEALOUSY (verses 11-31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - If any man's wife... commit a trespass against him. The adultery of the wife is here regarded only from a social point of view; the injury to the husband, the destruction of his peace of mind, even by the bare suspicion, and the consequent troubling of Israel, is the thing dwelt upon. The punishment of adultery as a sin had been already prescribed (Leviticus 20:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If it be laid. Or, \"if he be hid.\" This verse is explanatory of the former. Taken with the manner. The latter words are not in the Hebrew. It means no doubt \"taken in the act\" (cf. John 8:4).

As far as the mischief here dealt with was concerned, it was almost equally great whether the woman was guilty or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He shall bring her offering for her. קָדְבָּנָהּ, \"her offering;\" עָלֶיהָ, \"on her account.\" It was to be a meat offering - not connected on this occasion with any other sacrifice - of the fruits of the earth, symbolizing the fruits of her guilty, or at least care. less and suspicious, conduct. As of barley meal, not of fine wheat flour, it indicated her present low and vile estate (deserved or undeserved); as without incense or oil, it disclaimed for itself the sanctifying influences of God's grace and of prayer. Thus every detail of the offering, while it did not condemn the woman (for one found guilty could not have made any offering at all), yet represented her questionable repute and unquestionable dishonour, for even the unjust suspicion of the husband is a dishonour to the wife. Barley meal. In the days of Elisha half the price of fine flour (2 Kings 7:1), and only eaten by the poor (Ezekiel 4:12; John 6:9). An offering of jealousy. Literally, \"of jealousies.\" קְנָאֹת, an intensive plural. An offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. Θυσία μνημοσίνου, Septuagint. An offering to bring the woman into judicial remembrance before the Lord, in order that her sin (if any) might be remembered with him, and be declared.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Before the Lord.

Probably from the laver which stood near the altar (Exodus 30:18). The expression is nowhere else used. The Septuagint has ὕδωρ καθαρὸν ζῶν, pure running water. In an earthen vessel. Cheap and coarse, like the offering. Of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle. This is the only place where the floor of the tabernacle is mentioned. As no directions were given concerning it, it was probably the bare earth cleared and stamped. The cedar floor of the temple was overlaid with gold (1 Kings 6:16, 30). This use of the dust has been held to signify the factNEWLINENEWLINE(a) that man was made of dust, and must return to dust (Genesis 3:19); orNEWLINENEWLINE(b) that dust is the serpent's meat, i.e., that shame and disgust are the inevitable fruit of sin (Genesis 3:14; Isaiah 65:25). Of these,NEWLINENEWLINE(a) is not appropriate to the matter in question, since mortality is common to all, andNEWLINENEWLINE(b) is far too recondite to have been intended here. It is very unlikely that the spiritual meaning of Genesis 3:14 was known to any of the Jews. A much simpler and more intelligible explanation is to be found in the obvious fact that the dust of the tabernacle was the only thing which belonged to the tabernacle, and which was, so to speak, impregnated with the awful holiness of him that dwelt therein, that could be mixed with water and drunk. For a similar reason the \"sin\" of the people, the golden calf, was ground to powder, and the people made to drink it (Exodus 32:20). The idea conveyed to the dullest apprehension certainly was that with the holy dust Divine \"virtue\" had passed into the water - virtue which would give it supernatural efficacy to slay the guilty and to leave the guiltless unharmed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Uncover the woman's head. In token that she had forfeited her glory by breaking, or seeming to have broken, her allegiance to her husband (1 Corinthians 11:5-10); perhaps also with some reference to the truth that \"all things are naked and open to the eyes of him\" with whom she had to do (Hebrews 4:13). Put the offering of memorial in her hands. That she herself might present, as it were, the fruits of her life before God, and challenge investigation of them. Bitter water. It was not literally bitter, but it was so fraught with conviction and judgment as to bring bitter suffering on the guilty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If no man. The oath presupposed her innocence. With another instead of thy husband. Hebrew, \"under thy husband, i.e., as a wife subject to a husband (Ezekiel 23:5; Hosea 4:12). \"Υπανδρος οῦσα, Septuagint. It was only as a femme couverte that she could commit this sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Then the priest shall say unto the woman. These words are parenthetical, just as in Matthew 9:6. The latter part of the oath is called \"an oath of cursing,\" because it contained the imprecations on the guilty. To rot. Hebrew, \"to fall.\" Τὸν μηρόν σου διαπεπτωκότα,, Septuagint. To swell. The Hebrew zabeh is not of quite certain meaning, but probably this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Into thy bowels. Cf. Psalm 109:18. Αἰς τὴν κοιλίαν σου, Septuagint. It has been thought that these symptoms belonged to some known disease, such as dropsy (Josephus, Ant.,' 3:11, 6), or ovarian dropsy. But it is clear that the whole matter was outside the range of the known and of the natural. An innocent woman may suffer from dropsy, or any form of it; but this was a wholly peculiar infliction by direct visitation of God. The principle which underlay the infliction was, however, clear: δἰ ῶν γὰρ ἡ ἁμαρτία διὰ τούτων ἡ τιμωρία - the organs of sin are the seat of the plague. Amen, amen. Doubled here, as in the Gospel of John. The woman was to accept (if she dared) the awful ordeal and appeal to God by this response; if she dared not, she pronounced herself guilty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - In a book. On a roll. Blot them out with the bitter water. Rather, \"wash them off into the bitter water,\" in order to transfer the venom of the curses to the water. Ἐξαλείψει... εἰς τὸ ὔδωρ, Septuagint. The writing on the scroll was to be washed off in the vessel of water. Of course the only actual consequence was that the ink was mixed with the water, but in the imagination of the people, and to the frightened conscience of a guilty woman, the curses were also held in solution in the water of trial. The direction was founded on a world-wide superstition, still prevalent in Africa, and indeed amongst most semi-barbarous peoples. In the 'Romance of Setnan,' translated by Brugsch. Bey, the scene of which is laid in the time of Rameses the Great, a magical formula written on a papyrus leaf is dissolved in water, and drunk with the effect of imparting all its secrets to him that drinks it. So in the present day, by a similar superstition, do sick Mahomedans swallow texts of the Koran; and so in the middle ages the canonized Archbishop Edmund Rich (1240) on his death-bed washed a crucifix in water and drank it, saying, \"Ye shall drink water from the wells of salvation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He shall cause the woman to drink. This is said by anticipation, because she did not really drink it until after the offering (verse 26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Offer it upon the altar. According to the law of the minchah (Leviticus 2), only an handful was burnt as a \"memorial\" (Hebrew, azkarah), the rest being \"presented,\" and then laid at the side of the altar to be subsequently eaten by the priests. All this was done before the actual ordeal by drinking the water, in order that the woman might in the most solemn and complete way possible be brought face to face with the holiness of God. She stood before him as one of his own, yet as one suspected and abashed, courting the worst if guilty, claiming complete acquittal if innocent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Shall enter into her, and become bitter. Rather, \"as bitter,\" or \"as bitterness,\" i.e. as producing bitter sufferings.

A law prescribed by God, and yet in substance borrowed from half civilized heathens; a practice closely akin to yet prevalent superstitious, and yet receiving not only the toleration of Moses, but the direct sanction of God; an ordeal which emphatically claimed to be infallibly operative through supernatural agencies, yet amongst other nations obviously lending itself to collusion and fraud, as does the trial by red water practiced by the tribes of West Africa. In order to justify heavenly wisdom herein, we must frankly admit, to begin with -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That it was founded upon the superstitious notion that immaterial virtue can be imparted to physical elements. The holiness of the gathered dust and the awfulness of the written curses were both supposed to be held in solution by the water of jealousy. The record does not say as much, but the whole ordeal proceeds on this supposition, which would undoubtedly be the popular one.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That it was only fitted for a very rude and comparatively barbarous state of society. The Talmud states that the use of it ceased forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem (if so, during our Lord's earthly lifetime); but it may be held certain that it ceased long before - indeed there is no recorded instance of its use. It was essentially an ordeal, although one Divinely regulated, and as such would have been morally impossible and highly undesirable in any age but one of blind and uninquiring faith. And we find the justification of it exactly in the fact that it was given to a generation which believed much and knew little; which had a profound belief in magic, and no knowledge of natural philosophy. It was ever the wisdom of God, as revealed in the sacred volume, to take men as they were, and to utilize the superstitious notions which could not at once be destroyed, or the imperfect moral ideas which could not at once be reformed, by making them work for righteousness and peace. It is, above all, the wisdom of God not to destroy the imperfect, but to regulate it and restrain its abuses, and so impress it into his service, until he has educated his people for something higher. Everybody knows the extreme violence of jealousy amongst an uncivilized people, and the widespread misery and crime to which it leads. It may safely be affirmed that any ordeal which should leave no place for jealousy, because no room for uncertainty, would be a blessing to a people rude enough and ignorant enough to believe in it. Ordeals arc established in a certain stage of civilization because they are wanted, and are on the whole useful, as long as they remain in harmony with popular ideas. They are, however, always liable to two dangers.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) They occasionally fail, and are known to have failed, and so fall into disrepute.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) They always lend themselves readily to collusion or priestcraft. The trial of jealousy being adopted, as it was, into a system really Divine, and being based upon the knowledge and power of God himself, secured all the benefits of an ordeal and escaped all its dangers. It is probable enough that the awful side of it was never really called into play. No guilty woman would dare to challenge so directly a visitation so dreadful, as long as she retained any faith or any superstition. Before the time came when any Jewish woman had discarded both, the increasing facilities of divorce had provided another and easier escape from matrimonial troubles.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers5:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Num.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEverses 1-21 - Note. - The Hebrew Nazir has been written Nazarite in English under the mistaken impression that there is some connection between Nazir and Nazarene (Matthew 2:23). A very little reflection will show that \"the Nazarene\" not only was no Nazir, but that he even took pains to let it be seen that he was not. John the Baptist was the Nazir of the New Testament, and in all outward things the contrast was strongly marked between them (Luke 7:14, 33, 34; John 2:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Either man or woman. It was not a little remarkable that women could be Nazirites, because, generally speaking, the religious condition of women under the law was so markedly inferior and so little considered. But this is altogether consistent with the true view of the Nazirite vow, viz., that it was an exceptional thing, outside the narrow pale of the law, giving scope and allowance to the free movements of the Spirit in individuals. In this too it stood on the same plane as the prophetic office, for which room was left in the religious system of Moses, and which was designed to correct and supplement in its spiritual freedom the artificial routine of that system. As the prophetic office might be exercised by women, so the Nazirite vow might be taken by women. In either case we find a tribute to and a recognition of the Divine liberty of the Holy Ghost, and an anticipation of the time when the spirit of self-devotion should be poured out without distinction upon men and women. Shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the Lord. Rather, \"shall make a solemn vow, a Nazirite vow, to live consecrated unto the Lord.\" The two words translated \"separate\" are not the same. The first (from pala, to sever, to consecrate, to distinguish as exceptional) is of somewhat doubtful use here. In Judges 13:19 it appears to be used as an intensitive, \"did wonderously,\" and the Septuagint has here μεγάλως εὔξηται εὐχὴν. The other word (from נזר, to separate) is used in a general sense in Genesis 49:26; Deuteronomy 33:16, or with the addition, \"unto the Lord,\" as in Judges 13:5. It had, however, acquired a technical sense before this, as appears from Leviticus 25:5, 11, where the undressed vines are called \"Nazirites,\" as recalling the unshorn locks of those who had taken the vow. It is evident indeed, from the way in which the Nazirite vow is here spoken of, that it had been, perhaps long, familiar among the people. All that this commandment did was to recognize the practice, to regulate it minutely, and to adopt it into the religious code of Israel. Whence the custom was derived is wholly uncertain, for although the separate elements existed in many different quarters, yet the peculiar combination of them which made the law of the Nazirite is entirely peculiar. Vows of abstinence have, of course, been common among all religions. Mingled with much of superstition, self-will, and pride, they have sprung in the main from noble impulses and yearnings after a higher life, prompted by the Holy Spirit of God; and it may be said with some confidence, that in spite of all reproaches (deserved or undeserved), such voluntary vows of abstinence have done more than anything else to save religion from becoming an unreal profession. Hair offerings, on the other hand, springing from a simple and natural sentiment, have been common enough amongst the heathen. Compare the sacred locks of Achilles ('Iliad,' 23:142, sqq.), and the various use of the tonsure in pursuance of vows among the ancient Egyptians (Herod., 2:65) and amongst modern Mahomedans and Christians. The physical fact on which all these hair offerings rest is that the hair is the only portion of oneself which can be conveniently detached and presented.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Strong drink. Hebrew, shekar; σίκερα (Leviticus 10:9; Luke 1:15). Any intoxicating drink, other than wine including the beer of the Egyptians. Vinegar. Hebrew, chamets. It seems to have been freely used by the poorer people (Ruth 2:14), and was, perhaps, a thin, sour wine (\"vile potet acctum,\" Horat.). Liquor of grapes. A drink made by soaking grape-skins in water.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - From the kernels oven to the husk, or skin. Of grape-skins it is said that cakes were made which were considered a delicacy (Hosea 3:1, mistranslated \"flagons of wine\"), but this is doubtful. The Septuagint has οῖνον ἀμὸ στεμφόλων ἕως γιγάρτου, \"wine of grape-skins (the liquor of grapes mentioned before) even to the kernel.\" The expression is best understood as including anything and everything, however unlikely to be used, connected with the grape. It is clear that the abstinence of the Nazirite extended beyond what might possibly intoxicate to what was simply pleasant to the taste, like raisins, or refreshing, like charnels. The vine represented, by an easy parable, the tree of carnal delights, which yields to the appetite of men such a variety of satisfactions. So among the Romans the Flamen Dialis might not even touch a vine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - There shall no razor come upon his head. The meaning of this law is best understood from the case of Samson, whose strength was in his hair, and departed from him when his hair was cut. No doubt that strength was a more or less supernatural gift, and it went and came with his hair according to some supernatural law; but it is clear that the connection was not merely arbitrary, but was founded on some generally received idea. To the Jew, differing in this from the shaven Egyptian and the short-haired Greek, the hair represented the virile powers of the adult, growing with its growth, and failing again with its decay. To use a simple analogy from nature, the uncropped locks of the Nazirite were like the mane of the male lion, a symbol of the fullness of his proper strength and life (cf. 2 Samuel 14:25, 26, and, for the disgrace of baldness, 2 Kings 2:23). In later ages Western and Greek feeling on the subject prevailed over Eastern and Jewish, and a \"Hebrew of the Hebrews\" was able to argue that \"even nature itself\" teaches us \"that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him\" (1 Corinthians 11:14). No doubt \"nature itself\" taught the Greek of Corinth that lesson; but no doubt also \"nature itself\" taught the Jew of Palestine exactly the opposite lesson; and the Apostle himself did not quite discard the earlier sentiment, for he too made a Nazirite vow, and suffered his hair to grow while it lasted (Acts 21:24). The meaning, therefore, of the law was that the whole fullness of the man's vitality was to be dedicated without any diminution to the Lord, as typified by the free growth of his hair. It has been conjectured that it was allowed to the Nazirite to \"poll\" (κείρασθαι) his hair during his vow, although not to \"shave\" it (ξυρᾶσθαι); and in this way the statement is explained that St. Paul \"polled his head\" (κειράμενος τὴν κεφαλὴν, Acts 18:18, compared with Acts 21:24) in Cenchraea, because he had a vow. It is, however, quite evident that any permission to cut the hair is inconsistent with the whole intention of the commandment; for if a man might \"poll his head\" when he pleased, he would not be distinguished from other men. If it was allowed in the Apostle's time, it is only another instance of the way in Which the commandments of God were made of none effect by the traditions of men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother. The same injunction had been given to the priests (Leviticus 21:12) - \"for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him.\" A similar reason restrained the Nazirite. Because the consecration of his God is upon his head, i.e., because he wears the unshorn locks which are the outward sign of his separation unto God. The hair of the Nazirite was to him just what the diadem on the mitre was to the high priest, what the sacred chrism was to the sons of Aaron. Both of these are called by the word nezer (Exodus 29:6; Leviticus 21:12), from the same root as nazir. It was thought by some of the Jewish doctors that in these three particulars - the untouched growth of the hair, the abstinence from the fruit of the vine (cf. Genesis 9:20), and the seclusion from the dead - the separated life of the Nazirite reproduced the unfallen life of man in paradise. This may have had some foundation in fact, but the true explanation of the three rules is rather to be found in the spiritual truth they teach in a simple and forcible way. He who has a holy ambition to please God mustNEWLINENEWLINE(1) devote to God the whole forces of his being, undiminished by any wont and use of the world;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) abstain not only from pleasures which are actually dangerous, but from such as have any savour of moral evil about them;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) subordinate his most sacred private feelings to the great purpose of his life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. If any man die very suddenly by him. עָלָיו, in his presence, or neighbourhood, so that, having hastened to his assistance, lie found himself in contact with a corpse. This case is mentioned particularly, because it was the only one in which simple humanity or mere accident would be likely to infringe upon the vow. In the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day. This appears to be an anticipation of the law given below (Numbers 19:11); but that law may have only sanctioned the existing custom. Shall he shave it. Because \"the consecration of his God upon his head\" was desecrated by the pollution of death, it must, therefore, be made away with and begun over again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Two turtles, or two young pigeons. The same offerings had been prescribed for those defiled by divers unclean-nesses in Leviticus 15 (cf. Leviticus 12:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For that he sinned by the dead. This is one of the cases in which the law seemed to teach plainly that an outward, accidental, and involuntary defilement was sin, and had need to be atoned for. The opposite principle was declared by our Lord (Mark 7:18-93). The Septuagint has here the strange reading περὶ ω΅ν ἥμαρτε περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς. Shall hallow his head. By dedicating again to God the free growth of his hair.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For a trespass offering. Rather, \"for a guilt offering.\" Hebrew, asham (see Leviticus 5). The asham always implied guilt, even though it might be purely legal, and it was to be offered in this case in acknowledgment of the offence involved in the involuntary breach of vow. In the education of conscience, on anything lower than the \"perfect law of liberty,\" it was only possible to secure thoroughness and consistency at the cost of introducing much that was arbitrary and destined to pass away. Something similar must always be tolerated in the moral education of children. The days that were before shall be lost. Literally, \"shall fall.\" Septuagint, ἅλογοι ἔσονται, \"shall not be counted.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - When the days of his separation are fulfilled. The original law contemplated only a vow for a certain period, longer or shorter. All the Nazirites, however, of whom we read in Scripture were lifelong Nazirites: Samson (Judges 13:5), Samuel (1 Samuel 1:11), John the Baptist (Luke 1:15). In all these cases, however, the vow was made for them before their birth. Hegesippus (in Euseb. 2:23) tells us that James, the Lord's brother, was a Nazirite: \"He did not drink wine nor strong drink, and no razor came on his head.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He shall offer his offering. This offering included all the four ordinary sacrifices - the sin offering, the burnt offering, the peace offering, and the meat offering. For the meaning of these see Leviticus 4, 1, 3, 2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A basket of unleavened bread... anointed with oil. Required for every sacrifice of thanksgiving, as this was (Leviticus 7:12). And their meat offering, and their drink offerings, i.e., the gifts of meal, oil, and wine which belonged to burnt offerings and peace offerings (see below, Numbers 15:3, sqq. ).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and shall put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. It is not said, nor intended, that the hair was offered to God as a sacrifice. If so, it would have been burnt with the burnt offering which represented the self-dedication of the worshipper. It had been holy to the Lord, growing uncut all the days of the vow. The vow was now at an end; the last solemn act of sacrifice, the peace offering, which completed all, and typified that fearless and thankful communion with God which is the end of all religion, was now going on; it was fitting that the hair which must now be shorn, but could not be disposed of in any ordinary way, should be burnt upon the altar of God. In the fire, i.e., on the brazen altar. In later days it seems to have been done in a room assigned to the Nazirites in the court of the women: another deviation from the ordinal law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The sodden shoulder, or boiled shoulder; the left. The right, or heave shoulder, was already the priest's, according to the general rule (Leviticus 7:32). That the other shoulder was also \"waved\" and accepted by God as his portion, to be consumed in his name by the priest, was a further token of the gracious acceptance of the self-dedication of the Nazirite, and of the fullness of eucharistic communion into which he had entered with his God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Shall wave them. By putting his hands under the hands of the Nazirite. On the symbolism of this see Leviticus 7. Drink wine. Perhaps at the sacrificial feast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering. \"And of\" are not in the text. We should probably read, \"This is the law of the Nazirite who hath vowed his offering unto the Lord in accordance with his consecration,\" i.e., these are the offerings which, as a Nazirite, he is bound to make. Beside that his hand shall get. Literally, \"grasp.\" If he can afford or can procure anything more as a free-will offering, he may well do so. In later days it became customary for richer people to defray for their poorer brethren the cost of their sacrifices (Josephus, Ant., 19:6, 1; and cf. Acts 21:24).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:22-27 THE PRIESTLY BENEDICTION (verses 22-27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Lord spake unto Moses. It is a matter of mere conjecture at what point of time this command was given. As it concerned the priests and their daily ministration, it would be natural to suppose that it was given at the time when the tabernacle service was set up, i.e., at the precise point fixed by the first verse of the following chapter. That the command was given to Moses, and to Moses alone, and that after the consecration of Aaron to the high priesthood, serves to bring out into clear relief the relative position of the two. Aaron and his sons alone, as the \"official\" representatives of the Lord, could bless in his name and put . his name upon the people; but the formula of blessing was delivered to Aaron himself through Moses, as the \"personal\" representative of the Lord, the mediator of the old covenant. Ὁ νόμος. . διαταγεὶς . . ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου (Galatians 3:19). Our Lord is both the Moses (Acts 3:22) and the Aaron (Hebrews 6:20) - 5 ὁ μεσίτης and ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς - of this dispensation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - On this wise ye shall bless. In Leviticus 9:22 it is recorded that Aaron blessed the people, first by himself from the brazen altar of sacrifice, and afterwards in conjunction with Moses, when they came out of the tabernacle; and that he might so bless the people is mentioned as one object of his consecration (Deuteronomy 21:5; and cf. 1 Chronicles 23:13). Blessing in or with the name of the Supreme Being was an important part of all primitive religion, as appears from the case of Melchizedec and Abraham, of Isaac and his sons, of Jacob and Pharaoh. And this act of blessing was far from being a mere expression of good will, or from being a simple prayer; for\" without all contradiction the less is blessed of the greater\" (Hebrews 7:7), i.e., the blessing must be given by one who stands nearer to God to one who stands less near. The name of God could not be used in blessing save by one who had some right to such use of it, whether as prophet, as priest, or as patriarch. For that name in which the blessing was given was not inoperative, but was mighty with untold spiritual efficacy where rightly used as the name of blessing. To Aaron and to his sons was now confided this use of the Divine name, that all Israel might know and might hear in their appointed words the voice of God himself. Saying unto them. The benediction here appointed consists of three clauses, each complete in itself, and each consisting of two members, the second of which seems to present the application and result in experience of the grace besought in the first. Both, therefore, in its form and its contents this benediction is one of the most profound and most fruitful of the Divine oracles; and this indeed we might have expected, because (if we may venture to say so) God is never so entirely and absolutely himself as in blessing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD bless thee, and keep thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-26. - The Lord,... the Lord,... the Lord. Are we to see in this threefold use of the Divine name a shadowing forth of the Holy Trinity? It is obvious that it cannot be proved, and that it would not even have suggested any such idea to the priest who gave, or to the people who received, the benediction. To them the threefold form merely added beauty and fullness to the blessing (cf. Ecclesiastes 4:12). But that is not the question. The real question is whether the Old Testament was written for our sakes (1 Corinthians 9:10; 1 Corinthians 10:11; 2 Timothy 3:15, 16), and whether the God of the Jews was indeed the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (John 5:17; John 8:54). If so, it is not possible for us to avoid seeing in this benediction a declaration of the threefold Being of God, and it is not possible to avoid believing that he meant us to see such a declaration, veiled indeed from the eyes of the Jew, but clear enough to the Christian. For a somewhat similar case compare Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The Lord make his face shine upon thee. The \"face\" of God is his personality as turned towards man, or else turned away from him. His face hidden or turned away is despair and death (Deuteronomy 31:17, 18; Job 13:24); his face turned against man is destruction and death (Leviticus 17:10; Psalm 34:16); his face turned upon man in love and mercy is life and salvation (Psalm 27:1; Psalm 44:3). It is to the soul of man what the blessed sun of heaven is to his body. And be gracious unto thee. 'Ἐλεήσαι σε, Septuagint. Be kind and beneficent to thee: the effect in and on the soul of the clear shining upon it of the face of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee. Ἐπάραὶ.. τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ σέ, Septuagint. This clause seems to repeat the last in a somewhat stronger form, as implying more personal and individual attention from the Lord. His face shines upon all that love him, as the sun shines wherever no clouds intervene; but his face is lifted up to that soul for which he has a more special regard. נָשָׂא פָגִים אֶל seems to mean the same thing as נָשָׂא עֵינַיִם or שִׂיס (Genesis 43:29, ἀναβλέψας... τοῖς ὐφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ; 44:21). To lift up the eyes or the face upon any one is to look upon that one with peculiar and tender interest. And give thee peace (shalom). This peace, being the perfect fruit in experience of the grace which comes from God, forms the climax and conclusion of the benediction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - They shall put my name upon the children of Israel. The \"name of God is uniformly treated in Scripture as something very different from a mere arrangement of letters or an arbitrary vocal sound. All nations have bad names for the Supreme Being, but there was nothing sacred about them, except from association. The name of God was not of man, nor from man, but of his own direct revelation (Exodus 6:3), and was therefore of an unspeakable sanctity (Exodus 20:7; Exodus 33:19). Like the \"word\" of God, it cannot be dissociated from God himself. It is in some sense an extension outwards, into the sphere of the created and sensible, of the ineffable virtues of the Godhead itself. It stands in a real, though un-assignable, relation to infinite goodness and power, and therefore it comes fraught with untold blessing (or perchance cursing) to those on whom it lights. Hence, to put the name of God - the covenant name - upon the people had a real meaning. No one could do it except by his express direction; and when it was so done there was an invisible reality answering to the audible form; with the name pronounced in blessing came the blessing itself, came the special providence and presence of God, to abide upon such at least as were worthy of it. It is a fact, the significance of which cannot be denied, that the name which was commanded to be put upon the people was lost, and irrecoverably lost, by the later Jews. Out of an exaggerated dread of possible profanation, they first disobeyed the command by substituting Adonai for that name outside the sanctuary; and finally, after the death of Simeon the Just, the priests ceased to pronounce that name at all, and therefore lost the tradition by which the pronunciation was fixed. Our method of spelling and pronouncing the name as Jehovah is merely conventional, and almost certainly incorrect. It would seem to be the more devout opinion that the name itself, as revealed by God and uttered by many generations of priests, was forfeited (like Paradise), was withdrawn, and ought not to be inquired after. And I will bless them. Here is the precise truth of all effectual benediction: they shall put my name;... I will bless. The outward form was ministered by the priests, the inward reality was of God and from God alone. It is observable that the form of blessing is expressed in the singular; eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) because all Israel was regarded as one, even as the first-born son of God (Exodus 4:22, 23; Hosea 11:1), orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because all real blessing must in truth be individual - a nation can only be blessed in its several members.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - On the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle. This expression, \"on the day\" (Hebrew, בְּיום; Septuagint, ῆ ἡμέρᾳ), has given rise to considerable difficulty. Strictly speaking it should mean the first day of the first month of the second year (Exodus 40:17); and so the Targum of Palestine, \"It was on the day which begins the month Nisan.\" It is, however, quite clear from the narrative itself, as well as from its position, that the offerings were not actually made until after the taking of the census and the distribution of their respective duties to the Levitical families, i.e., until the eve of the departure from Sinai. Moreover, since the same phrase, בְּיום, occurs in verse 10, it is certain that it cannot apply to the actual presentation of the offerings, which was spread over twelve days (verse 11). The majority, therefore, of the commentators would read בְּיום here as in Genesis 2:4, \"at the time.\" It is, however, impossible to admit that there is any similarity whatever between the two passages. In Genesis 2:4 the context itself, as well as the subject matter, oblige us to understand the phrase in the looser sense; but in a plain historical account such as the present the obligation is all the other way. Either the date here given is a mistake (which, on any supposition, is most improbable), or it must be referred to the intention and inception of the princely offerings, the actual presentation being made at the time indicated in the narrative, i.e., in the first half of the second month. And had anointed it. From Leviticus 8:10, as compared with Exodus 40:35, it would rather appear that Moses did not anoint the tabernacle on the day it was set up, but on some subsequent day. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the tabernacle and the holy things were anointed through seven successive days: the statement in Leviticus 8:33-35 refers only to the consecration of the priests. Since the anointing of the tabernacle was connected with the setting of it up, as the last act of one ceremonial, and was only unavoidably postponed, there is nothing remarkable in the two things being spoken of as if they had taken place on one and the same day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The princes of Israel. These arc the same men, and are called by the same titles, as those Divinely nominated in Numbers 1:4, sq. No doubt they were the heads of the nations according to some established rules of precedence before the exodus. And were over them that were numbered. Hebrew, \"stood over.\" The most natural reference is to the fact of their presiding over the census, and so the Septuagint, οῦτοι οἱ παρεστηκότες ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπισκοπῆς. But it may mean simply that they were the leaders of the numbered hosts, and offered as their natural representatives.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They brought their offering before the Lord, i.e., probably to the entrance of the tabernacle. Six covered wagons. עֶגְלֹת צָב. The meaning of the qualifying word צָב is extremely doubtful. The Targums render it as the A.V. On the other hand, Gesenius and. De Wette render it \"litters,\" as the similar word צַבִּים in Isaiah 66:20 (where the Septuagint has ἐν λαμπήναις ἡμιόνων). The reading of the Septuagint, ἀμάξας λαμπηνίκας, is equally doubtful. Λαμπήνη, itself probably a foreign word, is explained by the Scholiasts as ἅμαξα βασιλικὴ, or as ἅρμα σκεπαστὸν; and Aquila has here ἅμαξαι σκεπασταὶ, and the Vulgate plaustra tecta. But Euseb. Emis. understands it as meaning \"two-wheeled vehicles.\" It is a matter of little importance, but the nature of the country itself and the small number of oxen to each carriage point to the probability that they had no wheels, and were carried by the oxen, one in front, and one behind, by means of shafts, as is still the case in parts of India.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord spake unto Moses. The Targum of Palestine here inserts the statement that Moses was not willing to receive them. He may very well have doubted whether God would sanction their use, as it had not been commanded; and it may be that some delay, perhaps of several days, occurred before he was able to accept them and to assign them to their future uses. In this, or some similar way, must be explained the apparent discrepancy of time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Take it of them. It was the first absolutely voluntary offering made for the service of God, and as such altogether acceptable. Former \"free-will offerings\" had been at the least invited this had not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTwo wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Four wagons... he gave unto the sons of Merari. The heavy portions of the fabric, which were intrusted to the Merarites, especially required this means of transport.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Upon their shoulders. For which purpose poles or bearing-frames had been provided, as implying more honour and care than the use of carriages. The death of Uzzah seems to have been the melancholy consequence of neglecting this rule (2 Samuel 6:3, 7, as compared with 1 Chronicles 15:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For dedicating of the altar. The altar was \"dedicated\" in the sense of being consecrated, by the anointing with the sacred oil and with the blood of the appointed sacrifices (Leviticus 8:10, 15). But it could still be \"dedicated\" in another sense by the sacrificial gifts, freely offered for the purpose, of the people. No rules appear to have been made as to dedications, but there is an allusion in Deuteronomy 20:5 to the dedication of houses, which may have been accompanied with religions rites, and we know that as a fact the temple was dedicated by Solomon (2 Chronicles 7:5), and re-dedicated by the Maccabees (1 Macc. 4:54, sq.), and the wall of Jerusalem was dedicated by Nehemiah (Nehemiah 12:27, sq.). The Septuagint has here εἰς τὸν ἐγκαινισμὸν, as in 1 Macc. 4:56, and cf. John 10:22. Offered their offering before the altar. This assuredly points to an offering made in common, and made at one time, via, on the day when the altar was anointed. It may be that the twelve princes all came for the purpose of making their offerings on that day, the day they would naturally choose for the purpose; but on account of the great number of other sacrifices, and the fewness of the priests, their offerings were postponed by the Divine command, and were actually received later. Thus in will and in meaning the offerings were made \"on the day\" of the consecration, but were publicly and solemnly received at some subsequent time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord said unto Moses. Doubtless in answer to his inquiry (see verse 89), at the time when the princes desired to make their offerings. Each prince on his day. For more convenience and solemnity, that the sacrifices might not be hurried over, and that none might feel neglected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Nahshon. The same appointed to act with Moses in the census, and to be captain of the children of Judah (Numbers 1:7; Numbers 2:3). The names of the other princes are to be found in the same passages, and their order in presenting is their order for the march. This seems to show that their off, rings were actually made after the arrangement of the camps had been settled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - His offering was. And exactly the same was the offering of each of the rest. This was right and good, because it showed an equal zeal and thankfulness and forwardness to give unto the Lord, and it took away all occasion for jealousy or boasting. One silver charger, or dish. Hebrew, kearah, a deep vessel (Exodus 25:9). Septuagint, τρυβλίον (cf. Matthew 26:23). An hundred and thirty shekels - weighing about as much as 325 shillings. One silver bowl. Hebrew, mizrak, from zarak, to scatter; a bowl for pouring; translated bason Exodus 27:3. Septuagint, φιάλη (cf. Revelation 5:8; Revelation 15:7). After the shekel of the sanctuary. According to the standard weight kept in the tabernacle (see Exodus 30:13). It seems to have weighed about as much as half-a-crown. Full of fine flour mingled with oil. This was for a present meat offering to accompany the animal sacrifices, and also to intimate the future use of the vessels - the larger as a measure for the fine flour, the smaller as a measure for the oil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne spoon of ten shekels of gold, full of incense:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - One spoon, or small cup, with a handle.

Literally, \"one shaggy one.\" Hebrew, sa 'eer. Septuagint, χίμαρον (see on Leviticus 4:23).

His offering, and that of all the rest, is described in exactly the same words and phrases, with the single minute exception, that in verse 19 we have, \"he offered for his offering,\" instead of \"his offering was.\" Even the small peculiarity of omitting the word shekels from the statement of the weight of the silver chargers and the golden spoons appears throughout (cf. Genesis 20:16). No doubt the record was copied or enlarged from some document written at the time, and its studied sameness reflects the careful and equal solemnity with which the offerings of the several princes were received.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the third day Eliab the son of Helon, prince of the children of Zebulun, did offer:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne kid of the goats for a sin offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Eliab the son of Helon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the fourth day Elizur the son of Shedeur, prince of the children of Reuben, did offer:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis offering was one silver charger of the weight of an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne kid of the goats for a sin offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Elizur the son of Shedeur.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the fifth day Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, prince of the children of Simeon, did offer:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne kid of the goats for a sin offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the sixth day Eliasaph the son of Deuel, prince of the children of Gad, offered:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis offering was one silver charger of the weight of an hundred and thirty shekels, a silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne kid of the goats for a sin offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Eliasaph the son of Deuel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the seventh day Elishama the son of Ammihud, prince of the children of Ephraim, offered:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - On the seventh day.

The verb substantive should be removed from verses 86-88, which simply continue the totals of the offerings which formed the dedication.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:87VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering: and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:88VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, after that it was anointed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers7:89VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 89. - And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation. Rather, \"the tent of meeting.\" Hebrew, ohel moed, where God had promised to meet with him (Exodus 25:22). To speak with him, i.e., with God, as implied in the word \"meeting.\" He heard the voice of one speaking unto him. Rather, \"he heard the voice conversing with him,\" making itself audible to him. מִדַּבֵּר, part. Hithpael, as in Ezekiel 2:2. Here is a distinct statement of the supernatural fact that God spake to Moses with an audible human voice, and (no doubt) in the Hebrew language, from out the empty darkness behind the veil. In the fact, indeed, of God so speaking audibly there was nothing new (see Genesis 3:8; Genesis 17:1, &c.), nor in the fact of his so speaking to Moses (see Exodus 3:4 and Exodus 33:9); but this records the fulfillment of that promise which was part of God's covenant with Israel, that he would at all times converse with Moses as their mediator from above the mercy-seat (see on Exodus 25:20-22, and cf. Deuteronomy 5:23-28). And he spake unto him, i.e., God spake unto Moses: the voice made itself audible, and by the voice God himself spake unto him. It is quite obvious that this statement more properly belongs to an earlier period, viz., to that immediately succeeding the consecration of the tabernacle. On the day it was set up Moses was not able to enter it (Exodus 40:35), but no doubt he did so very soon afterwards, and received from the mouth of the Lord, speaking in the holiest, all the commandments and ordinances recorded in Leviticus and in the beginning of this book. Perhaps the first communication made to him in this way concerned the offerings of the princes when first brought near (verses 4, 11), and for that reason the statement may have been appended to the record of those offerings.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake unto Moses. It does not appear when. The attempt of modern commentators to find a real connection between this section and the offering of the princes or the consecration of the Levites is simply futile. Such connection may be imagined, but the same ingenuity would obviously be equally successful if this section had been inserted in any other place from Exodus 37, to the end of this book. The more probable explanation will be given below.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When thou lightest the lamps. The command to light the lamps had been given generally (\"they shall light the lamps thereof\") in Exodus 25:37, and the care of them had been specially confided to Aaron and his sons (\"from evening to morning\") in Exodus 27:21. The actual lighting of the lamps for the first time by Moses is recorded in Exodus 40:25. In the face of these passages it is incredible that the lamps had not been regularly lighted by Aaron for more than a month before the offering of the princes. The seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. It is somewhat uncertain what this expression, here repeated from Exodus 25:37, means. The Targums give no explanation of it; the Septuagint merely renders verbally, κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς λυχνίας φωτιοῦσιν; the Jewish expositors seem to have thought that the light was to be thrown inward towards the central shaft; most modern commentators, with more probability, understand it to mean that the lamps were to be so placed as to throw their light across the tabernacle towards the north side.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And this work of the candlestick. For the meaning of the details here given see Exodus 25:31, sq. According unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses, - viz., in the mount (see Exodus 25:40) so he made the candlestick. This has been recorded in Exodus 37:17. The repetition of the statement in this place seems to be conclusive that these verses are out of their historical position, and that their insertion here is due to some fact connected with the original records with which we are not acquainted. It may be simply this, that these verses originally followed verse 89 of the previous chapter, and followed it still when it was inserted, for reasons already suggested, after the narrative of the offerings of the princes. Why, or how, such an admission should discredit the sacred narrative or imperil the truth of its inspiration it would be hard to say. The only thing really likely to imperil the sacred narrative is to persistently deny the obvious literary conclusions which arise from an honest consideration of the text.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:5-26 THE HALLOWING OF THE LEVITES (verses 5-23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord spake unto Moses. At some time subsequent to the command given in chapters Numbers 3:6-13, and no doubt before the passover.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And cleanse them. Before they actually entered upon their new duties they were to be solemnly hallowed. This hallowing, however, is not called קַדֵּשׁ, as is that of the priests (Exodus 29:1), but טַהֵר, cleansing. There was in their case no ceremonial washing, no vesting in sacred garments, no anointing with holy oil, or sprinkling with the blood of sacrifices. The Levites, in fact, remained simply representatives of the congregation, whereas the priests were representatives also of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Sprinkle water of purifying upon them. Rather, \"water of sin,\" so called because it had to do with the removal of sin, just as \"water of separation\" (Numbers 19:9, 13) was that which delivered from the legal state of separation. It is not likely to have been prepared in the same manner as this latter (Numbers 19:9), both because of the great difference between the two cases, and because the ordinance of the red heifer belonged to a later period. Nor is it likely to have resembled that used for cleansing the leper, or the water of jealousy. But it is rash to conclude that, because we do not read any special directions for its preparation, it must, therefore, have been nothing trot water from the laver which stood in the outer court. That water appears, indeed, to be called \"holy water\" in Numbers 5:17, which is intelligible enough; but no probable reason can be shown why it should be called \"sin water;\" it would seem as reasonable to call the water which our Lord turned into wine \"sill water,\" because it stood there \"for the purifying of the Jews.\" It is better to say that we do not know, because it is not recorded, how this water was prepared, or how it corresponded to its name. The Levites who were to be sprinkled would seem to have included all the males, some twenty thousand in number; because it was all the males, and not only those between thirty and fifty, who were to be dedicated in place of the first-born. In any case it was, of course, impossible that Moses could have sprinkled them individually (see below on verse 11). Let them shave all their flesh. Literally, \"let them cause the razor to pass over their whole body.\" Some distinguish between עָבַר תּעַר here and גִלַּה in Leviticus 14:8, 9, as though the latter meant a much more complete shaving off of the hair than the former; but this difference is doubtful; the fact that the whole body as well as the head was to be shaved implies that it was more than a mere cutting short of the hair. Let them wash their clothes. This was constantly enjoined on all the faithful as a preparation for any special religious service (see on Exodus 19:10). And so make themselves clean. The shaving and washing had, no doubt, a symbolic significance, but their primary object was simply and obviously personal cleanliness; it is the hair and the clothes that chiefly harbour impurities, especially in a hot climate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering. The ordinary sin offering was a shaggy one of the goats (see on chapter Numbers 7:16); but a bullock had been prescribed for the sin of the high priest, and for the sin of the congregation, in certain circumstances, and the analogy is followed here. It might seem as if the larger animal were meant to distinguish aggregate or collective guilt (see on Leviticus 4:3); but the scapegoat offered for the sin of the whole people makes against such a supposition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Before the Lord. As in chapter Numbers 5:16, either near the brazen altar, or more probably before the entrance of the tabernacle. And the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites. Presumably by means of their representatives, probably the tribe princes. This laying on of hands signified that the obligation to assist personally in the service of the sanctuary was transferred from the whole congregation to the Levites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering. Rather, \"Aaron shall wave\" them \"for a wave offering\" (Hebrew, nuph; see Exodus 29:24); and so in verses 13, 15, and 21. This injunction seems conclusive that the whole ceremonial was to be symbolically per. formed, for the Levites could not possibly be waved in any literal sense. Some have supposed that they were marched up and down before the altar, forgetting that the court would scarcely afford standing room for 1000 people, while the Levites between thirty and fifty numbered more than 8000. It is certain that the Levites could only be brought before the Lord, could only be waved (howsoever that was done), could only lay their hands upon the bullocks, by representation. If we suppose, e.g., that a hundred men of position and command among them entered the court as representatives of the tribe, then we can understand how the ceremonial here commanded might have been effectively carried out. That they may execute the service of the Lord. Literally, \"that they may be to execute the service of the Lord.\" Their being waved made them over in a figure to the Lord to be wholly his, and to live only for his service, and at his command. But just as wave offerings were assigned by Divine permission to the use of the priests, so were the Levites given to Aaron and his sons for ever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Shall lay their hands upon the beads of the bullocks. In token that they constituted these victims the ritual representatives and embodiments, the one of their sin, to be consumed and done away as by fire, the other of their life and strength, to be wholly offered unto God and accepted as by fire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron. This is not an additional command, but repeats in a slightly different form the previous orders. A similar repetition occurs in verse 15 b.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For they are wholly given unto me. See Numbers 3:5-13, the substance of which is emphatically repeated here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19b. - To make an atonement for the children of Israel. This is a remarkable expression, and throws light upon the nature of atonement. It is usually confined to purely sacerdotal ministrations, but it clearly has a somewhat different scope here. The idea that the Levites \"made an atonement\" by assisting the priests in the subordinate details of sacrifice hardly needs refutation: as well might the Gibeonites be said to \"make an atonement\" because they supplied the altar fire with wood. The real parallel to this is to be found in the case of Phinehas, of whom God testified that \"he hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel,\" and \"made an atonement for the children of Israel\" (Numbers 25:11, 13). It is evident that Phinehas turned away the wrath of God not by offering any sacrifices, but by making the sin which aroused that wrath to cease: he made an atonement for the people by discharging for them that holy and bounden duty (of putting away sin) which the rest of them failed to perform. Similarly the Levites made an atonement not by offering sacrifice (which they could no more do than the children of Judah), but by rendering unto God those personal duties of attendance and service in his courts which all the people ought to have rendered had they only been fit. That there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. See Numbers 1:53. The children of Israel were in this strait. As \"an holy nation,\" they were all bound, and their first-born as redeemed from the destroyer were specially bound, to render certain religious duties to God. But if they had attempted to render them they would have erred through ignorance and foolishness, and so have incurred Divine wrath and punishment, when they came nigh unto the sanctuary. From this strait the substitution of the Levites delivered them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Were purified, or \"purified themselves.\" It refers not to the ceremonial sprinkling, but to the personal preparation prescribed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In the tabernacle of the congregation. This can only mean that they went in after the holy things had been packed up in order to take the fabric to pieces; no one but the priests went into the tabernacle for any other purpose, or at any other time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - From twenty and five years old and upward. A short time before the minimum age had been fixed at thirty (Numbers 4:3). That direction, however, concerned the transport of the tabernacle and its belongings; this was a permanent regulation designed for the ordinary labours of the sanctuary at a time when the Levites would be scattered throughout their cities, and could only serve by courses. For the latter purpose many more would be required; and indeed they were found insufficient as it was in the latter days of David, when the wealth and devotion of the kingdom were fast increasing (see on 1 Chronicles 23:24-27). To wait upon the service. Literally, \"to war the warfare;\" the idea of the militia sacra is kept up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Shall minister... to keep the charge, and shall do no service. The word \"charge\" (Hebrew, mishmereth) seems to signify the care of the furniture and belongings of the tabernacle, while \"service\" means the laborious work of transport, or of preparing sacrifice. The duties of the Levite over fifty were in fact honorary, given to him probably for his own sake, that he might have some place and post in the house of God. This careful provision for those who should attain the age of fifty shows that the commandment was designed for the promised land rather than for the wilderness.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Num.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the first month of the second year. Before the census, and all the other events recorded in this book, except in part the offerings of the princes (see Numbers 7:1). There was, however, an obvious reason for mentioning together the two passovers, the second of which immediately preceded the departure from Sinai.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. Septuagint, ποιείτωσαν τὸ πάσχα. Cf. Matthew 26:18, ποιῶ τὸ πάσχα, and Luke 22:19, τοῦτο ποιεῖτε εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν. They may have been in doubt as to whether they were to keep it in the wilderness, and indeed they do not seem to have attempted to keep it again until they reached the promised land (see on Joshua 5:5, 6). The passover had indeed been made an \"ordinance for ever,\" but only when they were come to the land which the Lord should give them (Exodus 12:24, 25; Exodus 13:5). Apart, therefore, from express command, it would have been doubtful whether the feast should not at least he postponed. Inasmuch, however, as they had been detained at Sinai by Divine direction (albeit partly in consequence of their own idolatry, but for which they might already have been \"at home\"), it pleased God that they should not lack the blessing and support of the passover at its proper season.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - At even. See on Exodus 12:6. According to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof. This must be understood only of the essential rites and ceremonies of the passover, as mentioned below (verses 11, 12). It is singular that no mention is made of the considerable departure which circumstances necessitated from the original institution. It was not possible, e.g., to strike the blood of the lamb upon the lintel and the side-posts of the doors, because in the wilderness they had no doors. In after ages this rite (which was of the essence of the institution) was represented by the sprinkling of the blood of the lambs on the altar (2 Chronicles 30:16), but no command is on record which expressly authorized the change. In Leviticus 17:8-16 there is indeed a general direction, applying apparently to all domestic animals slain for food, that they be brought to the tabernacle to be slain, and that the priest sprinkle the blood upon the altar; and in Deuteronomy 16:5-7 there is an order that in future times the passover was only to be slain at the place which the Lord should choose. The actual practice in later ages seems to have been founded partly upon the command in Deuteronomy, which restricted the killing of the passover to Jerusalem (not, however, to the temple), and partly on the command in Leviticus, which really applied (at any rate in the letter) to the time of wandering only. As the celebration of the paschal feast had apparently been neglected from the time of Joshua until that of the later kings (Joshua 5:10; 2 Kings 23:21-22.), they were no doubt guided in the observance of it by the analogy of other sacrifices in the absence of express commands. It would, however, be an obvious source of error to assume that the practice of the age of Josiah or Hezekiah was the practice of the earliest passovers; so far as these necessarily differed from the original institution, it is absolutely uncertain how the difficulty was solved. Nothing perhaps better illustrates the mingled rigidity and elasticity of the Divine ordinances than the observance of the passover, in which so much of changed detail was united with so real and so unvarying a uniformity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And they kept the passover. It is a question which inevitably arises here, how they obtained a sufficient number of lambs for the requirement of so many people, and how they were slain sacrificially within the appointed time. The first difficulty does not seem serious when we consider,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that kids were available as well as lambs (see on Exodus 12:3);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the desert tribes would have abundance of lambs and kids for sale at this season, and that the Israelites certainly had money;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that in view of their speedy departure they would be disposed to kill off the young of their own flocks. The second difficulty is more serious, and would be insurmountable if we had to believe that the ritual of this passover was the same which afterwards prevailed. Josephus tells us ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 3) that in his day 256,000 lambs were slain and their blood sprinkled upon the altar within the three hours \"between the evenings.\" At that time, according to the same authority, a lamb was shared by ten, and often by as many as twenty people. The number of males who would partake of the paschal meal in the wilderness may be set down as not more than 800,000. If the women partook of it at all (which is very doubtful; cf. Exodus 12:44, 48), they would doubtless content themselves with the scraps left by the men. Allowing twenty souls to each lamb, the number required would be not more than 40,000. It is obvious at once that the three priests could not possibly kill 40,000 lambs in three hours, much less sprinkle their blood upon the altar; indeed the same may be said for 10,000, or even 5000, especially as they could not have acquired the extreme dexterity and dispatch which long practice taught to the later priests. Nor is it satisfactory to reply that the priests did the work \"out of the hand of the Levites ' (2 Chronicles 30:16),NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because this passover took place before the Levites were formally separated for the service of God and of the priests (see Numbers 8:22);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) because the smallness of the space about the altar would not allow of many people assisting;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) because the actual slaying and sprinkling, which was restricted to the priests (being distinctively sacrificial in nature), are the very things which we find impossible in the time. There are but two alternative conclusions, from one or other of which there is no honest escape: eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(a) the numbers of the people are greatly exaggerated, orNEWLINENEWLINE(b) the ritual of after days was not observed on this occasion.NEWLINENEWLINEAs to (a), see what is said on the whole question of numbers in the Introduction. As to (b), it must be borne in mind that no direction whatever had been given, as far as we know, either that the lambs must be slain by the priests only, or that their blood must be poured upon the altar. If the Jews were left to follow the original institution as nearly as possible, they would have killed the lambs themselves, and sprinkled the blood around the doors of their tents. It is true that according to the Levitical ritual, now recently put into use, all other animals slain in sacrifice (or indeed for food) must be slain at the tabernacle by the priest, and the blood sprinkled on the altar; and it is true that this general rule was afterwards held especially binding in the case of the passover. But there is nothing to show that it was held binding then: the passover had been ordained before the establishment of the Levitical priesthood and law of sacrifice; and it might very well have been considered that it retained its primal character unaffected by subsequent legislation, and that the priesthood of the people (in other rites transferred to Aaron and his sons) was recalled and revived in the case of this special rite. If this was the case both at this passover and at that under Joshua, it is easy enough to understand why the later practice was so entirely different; the neglect or disuse of centuries obliterated the tradition of the passover, and when it was revived by the later kings, they naturally followed the analogy of all other sacrifices, and the apparently express command of Leviticus 17:3-6. They could not indeed obey this command in their daily life, but they could and did obey it in the striking and typical case of the paschal feast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - There were certain men. It has been supposed by many that these men must have been Mishael and Elizaphan, who had recently (cf. Exodus 40:17; Leviticus 9:1; Leviticus 10:4) been defiled by burying their cousins Nadab and Abihu. This, however, is based upon the assumption that the totals given in Exodus 38:26 and in Numbers 1:46 are really independent, and that therefore no one belonging to any other tribe than that of Levi had died in the interval. As that assumption is untenable (see above on chapter Numbers 1:46), so this \"coincidence\" falls to the ground. We know indeed that Mishael and Elizaphan were defiled at this time, and we do not know that any one else was; but, on the other hand, the words \"the dead body of a man\" seem to point to a single corpse only. Dead body. Hebrew, nephesh, as in Numbers 5:2; Numbers 6:11, and other places. It is inexplicable how this word, which properly means \"soul,\" should have come to be used of a corpse; perhaps it is an additional testimony to the complete absence from Jewish teaching of any doctrine of an immortal spirit. The Septuagint uses ψύχη here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Wherefore are we kept back. The direction to remove from the camp all that were defiled by the dead (Numbers 5:2) had not apparently been given at this time, nor was there any express command that such should not partake of the passover, for Leviticus 7:20 may probably refer only to such uncleannesses as are mentioned in Leviticus 15:3; but that men were in fact considered as defiled by contact with the dead is clear from Leviticus 21:1. The men, therefore, had reason for asking why they were excommunicated, and Moses for referring the matter to the Divine decision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - If any man of you or of your posterity. The particular case of these men is made the occasion for a general provision for all succeeding times. Shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey. It is somewhat strange that these two cases only were provided for: a man otherwise unclean (as, e.g., in the case described Leviticus 15:13), even if actually recovered, was unable to take advantage of the little passover. Probably the real reason of it is to be found in this, that both the far journey and' the burial of the dead would presumably be works of charity. Afar off. This word, רְחֹקָה, is one of ten in the Pentateuch distinguished in the Hebrew Bibles with puncta extraordinaria, for some unknown and probably trifling reasons. The Rabbins ruled that it meant a distance of fifteen miles or more from the temple at sunrise of the fourteenth of Abib.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The fourteenth day of the second month. The interval gave ample time to return from any ordinary journey, or to be purified from pollution of death. It was in the spirit of this command, though not in the letter of it, that Hezekiah acted (2 Chronicles 30:2). And possibly it was in the spirit of this command that our Lord acted when he ate the passover by anticipation with his disciples twenty-four hours before the proper time - at which time he was himself to be the Lamb slain. With unleavened bread and bitter herbs. These and the following directions are expressly added for fear lest any should think that the little passover might be celebrated with less solemnity and with less carefulness than the great passover.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - According to all the ordinances of the passover. The later Jews held that this passover need only be kept for one day, and that leaven need not be put away from the house. But this was a clear departure from the original rule, for it was evidently intended that it should be in all respects a true passover, and in this case six clear days were allowed for the keeping of it (see on Numbers 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey. This threat was added no doubt in order to prevent men from taking advantage of the permission to keep a supplemental passover in order to suit their own convenience or interest. Only two reasons could absolve a man from the absolute necessity of keeping the passover at the due season, and these reasons must be bona fide, and not pretended. Because he brought not the offering of the Lord. In the original institution the paschal lamb did not appear distinctly in the character of an offering made to God, although undoubtedly it was such. It was rather the eating of the lamb that was insisted upon, as placing the partaker in communion with the God and Church of Israel, and so in a state of salvation. But after the law of sacrifices had been elaborated, then the paschal lamb, though prior to them all, naturally took its place amongst them as the greatest of them all, and as uniting in itself the special beauties of all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Ye shall have one ordinance. This is repeated from Exodus 12:49 as a further warning not to tamper more than absolute necessity required with the unity, either in time or in circumstance, of the great national rite.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 9:15-23 THE SIGNALS OF GOD (verses 15-23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - On the day that the tabernacle was reared up. Here we are sent back again to the great day of Israel's sojourn at Sinai, when God took visible possession of his dwelling in the midst of them (Exodus 40:34). Everything after that was but preparatory to the approaching departure, and therefore is narrated not in any order of time, but either as it referred back to the first day of the first month, or forward to the twentieth day of the second month. The cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony. The testimony was the decalogue written on the two tables of stone, and enshrined within the ark, the moral law which lay at the heart of Judaism. The tent of the testimony was the holy of holies in which the ark dwelt (see on Numbers 10:11; 18:2). The exact meaning of the words מִשְׁכָּז לְאֹהֶל הָעֵדֻח is disputed, or the rather significance of the לְ with which the phrase \"tent of the testimony\" is appended to the word \"tabernacle\" (dwelling). Some take it as equivalent in construction to the genitive, \"the dwelling of the tent of the testimony;\" in which case it would simply mean that the cloud covered the whole tabernacle, the mishcan which enveloped and enclosed the ohel, which again enshrined the ark and the testimony. Others take לְ here in the sense of \"at\" or \"towards,\" and read, \"covered the dwelling, towards the tent of the testimony,\" i.e., over that part of it in which the testimony was kept. Apart from the strict grammatical question, the comparison of other passages cited (especially Exodus 40:34) seems in favour of the first interpretation, and so apparently the Septuagint and the Targums.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So it was alway. This supernatural phenomenon was not transitory, like the glory-cloud within the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35; cf. 1 Kings 8:10), but permanent, as long at least as the Israelites were in the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - When the cloud was taken up. This verse and the following to the end of the chapter are an amplification of Exodus 40:36-38 (cf. Exodus 13:21, 22; Nehemiah 9:12; Psalm 78:14). It would appear from Exodus 13:21 that there was nothing new in the fact of the cloudy fiery pillar directing the movements of the host, but only in the fact of its resting on the tabernacle when in repose. In the place where the cloud abode, or \"came down.\" שָׁכַז. As the tabernacle was taken all to pieces, and its portions widely separated on the march, the cloud could not rest upon it as a signal for halting. We must probably picture to ourselves the cloud rising to some considerable height when it was \"taken up,\" so as to be visible for a great distance, and as settling down again over the spot where the tabernacle was to be set up. In this way the signals given by the cloud would be immediately perceived by a vast multitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Tarried long. Hebrew, אָרַך, \"to prolong,\" i.e., the resting. The Septuagint has ἐφέλκηται... ἡμέρας πλείους.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And so it was.

Allowing but a single night's rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Or a year. Rather, \"days\" (yamin): an undefined period (Genesis 4:3; Genesis 40:4), often equivalent to a year (Leviticus 25:29). It is not known whether or on what occasion the Israelites actually remained in camp for a year. But it is evident that this passage must have been written after the wanderings were over, because it is a kind of retrospect of the whole period as regards one important feature of it. It may of course have been added here by the hand of Moses on the eve of entry upon the promised land: or it may have been added by a later hand, perhaps that of Ezra when he revised these books (see the Introduction).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTNumbers9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.VERSEEND",
