Verse 1. - Moreover; rather, for. He has just shown them, by his own example, the necessity for strenuous watchfulness and effort. In continuance of the same lesson, he teaches them historically that the possession of great privileges is no safeguard, and that the seductions, even of idolatry, must not be carelessly despised. Although the connection of the various paragraphs is not stated with logical precision, we see that they all bear on the one truth which he wants to inculcate, namely, that it is both wise and kind to limit our personal freedom out of sympathy with others. The reading \"but\" (δὲ, morever) is probably a correction of the true reading (γὰρ, for), due to the failure to understand the whole train of thought. I would not that ye should be ignorant. This is a favourite phrase of St. Paul's (1 Corinthians 12:1; 2 Corinthians 1:8; Romans 1:13; Romans 11:25; 1 Thessalonians 4:13). The ignorance to which he refers is not ignorance of the facts, but of the meaning of the facts. All our fathers. He repeats the \"all\" five times, because he wishes to show that, though \"all\" partook of spiritual blessings, most (ver. 5) fell in spite of them. He says, \"our fathers,\" not only because he was himself a Jew, but also because the patriarchs and the Israelites were spiritually the fathers of the Christian Church. Were under the cloud. The compressed Greek phrase implies that they went under it, and remained under its shadow. The \"cloud\" is the \"pillar of cloud\" (Exodus 13:21), of which David says, \"He spread a cloud for a covering\" (Psalm 105:39). The Book of Wisdom (10:17) calls it \"a cover unto them by day,\" and (19:7) \"a cloud shadowing the camp.\" All passed through the sea (Exodus 14:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Were all baptized. This reading, though well supported, may, perhaps, be a correction for the middle, \"they baptized themselves,\" i.e. accepted baptism. The passing under the cloud (Exodus 14:19) and through the sea, constituting as it did their deliverance from bondage into freedom, their death to Egypt, and their birth to a new covenant, was a general type or dim shadow of Christian baptism (compare our collect, \"figuring thereby thy holy baptism\"). But the typology is quite incidental; it is the moral lesson which is paramount. Unto Moses; rather, into. By this \"baptism\" they accepted Moses as their Heaven-seat guide and teacher.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd did all eat the same spiritual meat;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And did all eat the same spiritual meat. As the cloud and the Red Sea symbolized the waters of baptism, so the manna and the water of the rock symbolized the elements of the other Christian sacrament, the Lord's Supper. The manna might be called \"a spiritual food,\" both because it was \"angels' food\" (Psalm 78:25; Wisd. 16:20) and \"bread from heaven\" (Psalm 78:24; John 6:31), and also because it was a type of \"God's good Spirit,\" which he \"gave to instruct them\" (Nehemiah 9:20). St. Paul only knows of two sacraments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The same spiritual drink. The water from the smitten rock might (Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:11) be called a \"spiritual\" drink, both as being a miraculous gift (comp. Galatians 4:29, where Isaac is said to be \"born after the spirit\"), and as being a type of that \"living water\" which \"springs up into everlasting life\" (John 4:14; John 7:37), and of the blood of Christ in the Eucharist (John 6:55). These \"waters in the wilderness\" and \"rivers in the desert\" were a natural symbol of the grace of God (Isaiah 43:23; Isaiah 55:1), especially as bestowed in the sacrament through material signs. They drank; literally, they were drinking, implying a continuous gift. Of that spiritual Rock that followed them; rather, literally, of a spiritual following Rock. This is explainedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as a mere figure of speech, in which the natural rock which Moses smote is left out of sight altogether; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) as meaning that not the rock, but the water from the rock, followed after them in their wanderings (Deuteronomy 9:21). There can, however, be little or no doubt that St. Paul refers to the common Jewish Hagadah, that the actual material rock did follow the Israelites in their wanderings. The rabbis said that it was round, and rolled itself up like a swarm of bees, and that, when the tabernacle was pitched, this rock came and settled in its vestibule, and began to flow when the princes came to it and sang, \"Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it\" (Numbers 21:17). It does not, of course, follow from this allusion that St. Paul, or even the rabbis, believed their Hagadah in other than a metaphorical sense. The Jewish Hagadoth - legends and illustrations and inferences of an imaginative Oriental people - are not to be taken au pied de la lettre. St. Paul obviates the laying of any stress on the mere legend by the qualifying word, \"a spiritual Rock.\" And that Rock was Christ. The writings of Philo, and the Alexandrian school of thought in general, had familiarized all Jewish readers with language of this kind. They were accustomed to see types of God, or of the Word (Logos), in almost every incident of the deliverance from Egypt and the wanderings in the wilderness. Thus in Wisd. 10:15 and Wisdom 11:4 it is Wisdom - another form of the Logos - who leads and supports the Israelites. The frequent comparison, of God to a Rock in the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 32, passim; 1 Samuel 2:2; Psalm 91:12, etc.) would render the symbolism more easy, especially as in Exodus 17:6 we find, \"Behold, I [Jehovah] will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - With many of them; rather, with most of them. They were overthrown in the wilderness. A quotation from the LXX. of Numbers 14:16. All but Caleb and Joshua perished (Numbers 26:64, 65; comp. Jude 1:5). In Hebrews 3:17 the word used is \"they fell.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - These things were our examples. If this rendering be adopted, perhaps \"examples\" is the best equivalent of the original tupoi, as in Philippians 3:17, \"Walk so as ye have us for an example (tupelo).\" It may, however, mean \"types,\" i.e. foreshadowing symbols, as in Romans 5:14, where Adam is the \"figure\" (tupos) of Christ. But, in spite of Alford's decisive rejection of it, the rendering, \"Now in these things they proved to be figures of us,\" is at least equally probable. To the intent. Of course, the events had their own immediate instruction, but the example which they involved was the ulterior purpose of their being so ordained by the providence of God. As they also lusted. (For quails, Numbers 11:4, 33; and see Psalm 95:7-11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - As were some of them. As in the case of the golden calf, the worship of Moloch, Remphan, Baal-peor, etc. In the prominent instance of the calf worship, they (like the Corinthians) would have put forth sophistical pleas in their own favour, saying that they were not worshipping idols, but only paying honour to cherubic emblems of Jehovah. To play. The word is, perhaps, used euphemistically for the worst concomitants of a sensual nature worship (Exodus 32:3-6), which resembled the depraved and orgiastic worship of Aphrodite Pandemos at Corinth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Commit fornication. This sin was not only an ordinary accompaniment of idolatry, but often a consecrated part of it, as in the case of the thousand hierodouloi, or female attendants, in the temple of Aphrodite on Acro-Corinthus. Three and twenty thousand. The number given in Numbers 25:9 is twenty-four thousand. We cannot give any account of the discrepancy, which is, however, quite unimportant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Tempt Christ (see the note on ver. 4). Christ is here identified with the angel which went before the Israelites, whom they were specially warned not \"to provoke,\" because \"my Name is in him\" (Exodus 23:20, 21). Another reading is \"the Lord.\" \"Christ\" may have come in from a marginal gloss. On the other hand, since \"Christ\" is the more difficult reading, it was, perhaps, the more likely to be altered by copyists. The word for \"tempt\" means \"tempt utterly,\" \"tempt beyond endurance.\" As some of them (Exodus 17:2, 7; Numbers 14:22; Numbers 21:5, 6). Of serpents; rather, perished by the serpents, viz. the \"fiery serpents\" of the wilderness (Numbers 21:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Neither murmur ye (Numbers 14:2, 29; Numbers 16:41, 49). The Corinthians were at this time murmuring against their teacher and apostle. Of the destroyer. All plagues and similar great catastrophes, as well as all individual deaths, were believed by the Jews to be the work of an angel whom they called Sammael (see Exodus 12:23; 2 Samuel 24:16; Job 33:22; 2 Macc. 15:22). In the retribution narrated in Numbers 16:41, etc., fourteen thousand seven hundred perished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For ensamples; literally, by way of figure; typically. The rabbis said, \"Whatever happened to the fathers is a sign to their children.\" The thought is the same as in Romans 15:4, \"Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning.\" The example in this instance would come home more forcibly from the sickness and mortality then prevalent among the Corinthian Christians (1 Corinthians 11:30). The ends of the world; rather, of the egos. The expression is in accordance with the view which regarded the then epoch as \"the close or consummation of the ages\" (Matthew 13:39; 1 Peter 4:7, \"The end of all things is at hand;\" 1 John 2:18, \"It is the last time;\" Hebrews 9:26; Matthew 13:39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Take heed lest he fall. The Corinthians, thinking that they stood, asserting that they all had knowledge, proud of the insight which led them to declare that \"an idol is nothing in the world,\" were not only liable to underrate the amount of forbearance due to weaker consciences, but were also in personal danger of falling away. To them, as to the Romans, St. Paul means to say, \"Be not highminded, but fear\" (Romans 11:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But such as is common to man; rather, except such as is human; i.e. such as man can bear. The last verse was a warning; this is an encouragement. Having just heard what efforts even St. Paul had to make to run in the Christian race, and how terribly their fathers in the wilderness had failed to meet the requirements of God, they might be inclined to throw up every effort in despair. St. Paul, therefore, reminds them that these temptations were not superhuman, but were such as men had resisted, and such as they could resist. God is faithful He had called them (1 Corinthians 1:9), and since he knew \"how to deliver the godly out of temptations\" (2 Peter 2:9), he would surely perform his side of the covenant, and, if they did their parts, would stablish and keep them from evil (2 Thessalonians 3:3). Also. The mode of deliverance shall be ready simultaneously with the temptation. Away to escape; rather, the way to escape. The way to escape is different in different temptations, but for each temptation God would provide the special means of escaping it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Wherefore. As a result of the whole reasoning, which has been meant to inspire the weak with a more liberalizing knowledge, and the strong with a more fraternal sympathy. Dearly beloved. The word \"dearly\" should be omitted. Flee from idolatry. The original implies that they were to turn their backs on idolatry, and so fly from it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-22. - The inherent disgracefulness of any tampering with idolatry. Verse 15. - I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. An appeal to their own reason to confirm his argument (comp. 1 Corinthians 11:13), perhaps with a touch of irony in the first clause (1 Corinthians 4:10; 2 Corinthians 11:19). The word for \"I say\" is φημι, I affirm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The cup of blessing. A translation of the name cos haberachah (comp. Psalm 116:13), over which a blessing was invoked by the head of the family after the Passover. The name is here transferred to the chalice in the Eucharist, over which Christ \"gave thanks\" (1 Corinthians 11:24; Matthew 26:27). There seems to be a close connection between the idea of \"blessing\" (eulogesas, Matthew 26:22; Mark 14:22) and \"giving thanks\" (eucharistesas, Luke 22:19), and here, as always, St. Paul and St. Luke resemble each other in their expressions. The communion of; literally, a participation in. By means of the cup we realize our share in the benefits wrought by Christ's precious blood shedding. The cup is at once a symbol and a medium. The blood of Christ; of which the wine is the sacramental symbol. By rightly drinking the wine, we spiritually partake of the blood of Christ, we become sharers in his Divine life. The bread; perhaps rather, the loaf, which was apparently passed from hand to hand, that each might break off a piece. Is it not the communion of the body of Christ? The best comment on the verse is John 6:41-59, in which our Lord taught that there could be no true spiritual life without the closest union with him and incorporation into his life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - We being many are one bread, and one body. It is easy to see how we are \"one body,\" of which Christ is the Head, and we are the members. This is the metaphor used in 1 Corinthians 12:12, 13 and Romans 12:5. The more difficult expression, \"we are one bread,\" is explained in the next clause. The meaning seems to be - We all partake of the loaf, and thereby become qualitatively, as it were, a part of it, as it of us, even as we all become members of Christ's one body, which that loaf sacramentally represents Some commentators, disliking the harshness of the expression, render it, \"Because there is one bread, we being many are one body;\" or, \"For there is one bread. We being many are one body.\" But the language and context support the rendering of our version; and the supposed \"physiology\" is not so modern as to be at all surprising.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Partakers of the altar. It is better to render it \"Have they not communion with the altar?\" for the word is different from that in the last verse. The meaning is that, by sharing in the sacrifices, the Jews stood in direct association with the altar, the victims, and all that they symbolized (Deuteronomy 12:27). And St. Paul implied that the same thing is true of those who sympathetically partook of idol offerings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - What say I then? What is it, then, which I am maintaining (φημι)? That the idol is anything. St. Paul repudiates an inference which he had already denied (1 Corinthians 8:4). Is anything. Has any intrinsic value, meaning, or importance. In itself, the idol offering is a mere dead, indifferent thing. Of itself, the idol is an eidolon - a shadowy, unreal thing, one of the elilim; but in another aspect it was \"really something,\" and so alone could the rabbis account for phenomena which seemed to imply the reality of infernal miracles ('Avoda Zarah,' fol. 54, 2; 55, 1; and see note in 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:74).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But. The word rejects the former hypothesis. \"[No I do not admit that], but what I say is that,\" etc. They sacrifice to devils, and not to God. The word \"demons\" should be used, not\" devils\" (Deuteronomy 32:17). The argument is that, though the idol is nothing - a mere stock or stone - it is yet the material symbol of a demon (see Psalm 96:5; Psalm 106:37; Baruch 4:7). So Milton -NEWLINENEWLINE\"And devils to adore for deities;NEWLINEThen were they known to men by various names,NEWLINEAnd various idols through the heathen world,...NEWLINEThe chief were those who, from the pit of hell,NEWLINERoaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fixNEWLINETheir seats long after next the seat of God,NEWLINETheir altars by his altar, gods adoredNEWLINEAmong the nations round.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Paradise Lost,' 1.) St. Paul uses a word which, while it would not be needlessly offensive to Gentiles, conveyed his meaning. The Greeks themselves called their deities daimonia, and St. Paul adopts the word; but to Jewish ears it meant, not \"deities\" or \"demigods,\" but \"demons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Ye cannot. It is a moral impossibility that you should. The Lord's table. This is the first instance in which this expression is used, and it has originated the name. The table of devils (see Deuteronomy 32:37). In the fine legend of Persephone, she might have been altogether liberated from the nether world if she had eaten nothing since her sojourn there; but unhappily she had eaten something, though it was only the few grains of a pomegranate; and hence she must leave the upper air, and become the Queen of Hades.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? (Deuteronomy 32:21,\" They have moved me to jealousy by that which is not God\"). The expression, \"a jealous God,\" is used in the second commandment with express reference to idolatry, as in Exodus 34:14, 15. Are we stronger than he? Can we, therefore, with impunity, kindle his anger against us? \"He is... mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?\" (Job 9:4). Ver. 23 - 1 Corinthians 11:1. - Directions about eating idol offerings, founded on these principles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - All things are lawful for me (see 1 Corinthians 6:12). The \"for me\" is not found in א, A, B, C, D. St. Paul repeats the assertion and its limitations, because he has now proved their force. He has shown that Christian liberty must be modified by considerations of expediency and edification in accordance with the feelings of sympathy and charity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - But every man another's wealth. The addition of the word \"wealth\" is very infelicitous. Rather, as in the Revised Version, but each his neighbour's good (comp. ver. 33 and Romans 15:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Whatsoever is sold. By this practical rule of common sense he protects the weak Christian from being daily worried by over scrupulosity. If a Christian merely bought his meat in the open market, no one could suspect him of meaning thereby to connive at or show favour to idolatry. It would, therefore, be needless for him to entertain fantastic scruples about a matter purely indifferent. The fact of its forming part of an idol offering made no intrinsic difference in the food. Shambles; rather food market. Asking no question for conscience sake. Do not trouble your conscience by scruples arising from needless investigation (ἀνακρίνων) about the food.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For the earth is the Lord's (Psalm 24:1). Consequently, \"Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving\" (1 Timothy 4:4). The text formed the ordinary Jewish \"grace before meat.\" The fulness thereof. The plenitude of its created furniture - plants, animals, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Bid you to a feast. It is assumed that the feast is to take place in a private house, not an idol temple (1 Corinthians 8:10). Ye be disposed to go; rather, ye wish to go, with an emphasis on the \"wish,\" which, as Grotius says, perhaps implies that the wish is not particularly commendable, although the apostle, in his large-hearted tolerance, does not actually blame it. The rabbis decided very differently. \"If,\" said Rabbi Ishmael, \"an idolater makes a feast in honour of his son, and invites all the Jews of his town, they eat of the sacrifices of the dead, even though they eat and drink of their own\" ('Avodah Zarah,' fol. 18, 1). There are many passages of the Talmud which raise the suspicion that the rabbis are purposely running counter to the teaching of the New Testament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - But if any man say unto you. Who is the \"any man\" is left undefined. Perhaps some \"weak\" Christian is meant, who happens to be a fellow guest. This is offered in sacrifice unto idols. The true reading is probably, hierothuton, sacred sacrifice, not eidolothuton, idol sacrifice. Perhaps there is a touch of delicate reserve in the word, implying that the remark is made at the table of heathens, who would be insulted by the word eidolothuton, sacrificed to idols. Whoever the interlocutor is supposed to be - heathen host or Christian guest - the mere fact of attention being drawn to the food as forming part of a heathen sacrifice is enough to make it your duty to give no overt sanction to idolatry. In that case, therefore, you ought to refuse it. It will be seen how gross was the calumny which asserted that St. Paul taught men to be indifferent about eating things offered to idols. He only taught indifference in cases where idolatry could not be directly involved in the question. He only repudiates the idle superstition that the food became inherently tainted by such a consecration when the eater was unaware of it. In later times, when the eating of such offerings was deliberately erected into a test of apostasy, he would have used language as strong against every semblance of compliance as any which was used by St. John himself or by Justin Martyr. Difference of time and circumstances necessarily involves a difference in the mode of viewing matters which in themselves are unimportant. For the earth is the Lord's. It is doubtful whether the repetition of this clause is genuine. It is omitted by all the best uncials.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other. You may be well aware that you intend no sanction of idolatry, but if the other supposes that you do, you wound his conscience, which you have no right to do. Your own conscience has already decided for itself. For why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? These words explain why he said \"conscience not thine own.\" The mere fact that another person thinks that we are doing wrong does not furnish the smallest proof that we are doing wrong. We stand or fall only to our own Master, and our consciences are free to form their own independent conclusion. Perhaps in this clause and the next verse we have an echo of the arguments used by the Corinthian \"liberals,\" who objected to sacrifice themselves to the scruples of the weak. The independence of conscience is powerfully maintained in Romans 14:2-5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - For if I. The \"for\" should be omitted. There is no copula in the best manuscripts. By grace. The word may also mean \"with thankfulness\" (comp. Romans 14:6. \"He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth, for he giveth God thanks;\" 1 Timothy 4:3, \"Meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving;\" compare our phrase,\" saying grace\"). Another view of these clauses interprets them to mean \"You should refrain because, by net doing so, you give occasion to others to judge you\" - a rule which has been compared with Romans 14:16, \"Let not your good be evil spoken of.\" Whichever view be taken, it is clear that theoretically St. Paul sided with the views of the \"strong,\" but sympathetically with those of the \"weak.\" He pleaded for some concession to the scrupulosity of ever morbid consciences, he disapproved of a defiant, ostentatious, insulting liberalism. On the other hand, he discouraged the miserable micrology of a purblind and bigoted superstition, which exaggerated the importance of things external and indifferent. He desiderated more considerateness and self denial on the one side; and on the other, a more robust and instructed faith, he would always tolerate the scruples of the weak, but would not suffer either weakness or strength to develop itself into a vexatious tyranny.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - All. There is much grandeur in the sweeping universality of the rule which implies that all life, and every act of life, may be consecrated by holy motives. To the glory of God. Not to the glorification either of your own breadth of mind or your over-scrupulosity of conscience, but \"that God in all things may be glorified\" (1 Peter 4:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Give none offence. Of course St. Paul means \"give no offence in unimportant, indifferent matters\" (comp. Romans 14:13). \"Offence\" means \"occasion of stumbling.\" The word only occurs in Acts 24:16; Philippians 1:16. Nor to the Gentiles; rather, nor to the Greeks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians10:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - That they may be saved.

What Christ's example was, in that he too \"pleased not himself,\" he sets forth in Romans 15:1-3; and the general principle of self abnegation for the sake of others in Philippians 2:4-8. This verse ought to be included in ch. 10. It sums up the whole argument, and explains the long digression of ch. 9. As I also am of Christ. This limits the reference to his own example.

Verse 2. - Now; rather, but, on the other hand. That ye remember me in all things, and keep, etc. This is probably a quotation from their letter. He thanks them for this kind message, but points out one particular in which their practice was not quite commendable. The ordinances. The word literally means traditions, but is here rightly applied to rules which he had delivered to them. The Vulgate has praecepta. The word is used in Matthew 15:2 of the rules and precedents laid down by the rabbis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But I would have you know; rather, but I wish you to know. That the head of every man is Christ. St. Paul, as was customary with him, applies the loftiest principles to the solution of the humblest difficulties. Given a question as to what is right or wrong in a particular instance, he always aims at laying down some great eternal fact to which the duty or decision is ultimately referable, and deduces the required rule from that fact. The headship of Christ is stated in Ephesians 1:22; Ephesians 4:15; and its application to the superiority of man is laid down also in Ephesians 5:23. The subordinate position of the woman is also stated in 1 Timothy 2:11, 12; 1 Peter 3:1, 5, 6, etc. This, however, is merely an ordinance of earthly application. In the spiritual realm \"there is neither male nor female\" (Galatians 3:28). The head of the woman is the man. In Christ the distinctions of the sexes are done away. It was, perhaps, an abuse of this principle which had led the Corinthian women to assert themselves and their rights more prominently than decorum warranted. The head of Christ is God. That Christ is \"inferior to the Father as touching his manhood,\" that his mediatorial kingdom involves (so far) a subordination of his coequal Godhead, has been already stated in 1 Corinthians 3:23, and is further found in 1 Corinthians 15:27, 28. This too is the meaning of John 14:28, \"My Father is greater than I.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Prophesying; that is, preaching. Having his head covered. This was a Jewish custom. The Jewish worshipper in praying always covers his head with his tallith. The Jew (like Orientals generally) uncovered his feet because the place on which he stood was holy ground; but he covered his head by way of humility, even as the angels veil their faces with their wings. AEneas is said by Servius to have introduced this custom into Italy. On the other hand, the Greek custom was to pray with the head uncovered. St. Paul - as some discrepancy of custom seems to have arisen - decided in favour of the Greek custom, on the high ground that Christ, by his incarnation, became man, and therefore the Christian, who is\" in Christ,\" may stand with unveiled head in the presence of his Father. Dishonoureth his head. He dishonoureth his own head, which is as it were a sharer in the glory of Christ, who is Head of the whole Church. \"We pray,\" says Tertullian, \"with bare heads because we blush not.\" The Christian, being no longer a slave, but a son (Galatians 4:7), may claim his part in the glory of the eternal Son. The head was covered in mourning (2 Samuel 15:30; Jeremiah 14:13), and the worship of the Christian is joyous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Or prophesieth. Although St. Paul \"thinks of one thing at a time,\" and is not here touching on the question whether women ought to teach in public, it appears from this expression that the rule which he lays down in 1 Corinthians 14:34, 35, and 1 Timothy 2:12 was not meant to be absolute. See the case of Philip's daughters (Acts 21:9 and Acts 2:17). With her head uncovered. For a woman to do this in a public assembly was against the national custom of all ancient communities, and might lead to the gravest misconceptions. As a rule, modest women covered their heads with the peplum or with a veil when they worshipped or were in public. Christian women at Corinth must have caught something of the \"inflation\" which was characteristic of their Church before they could have acted with such reprehensible boldness as to adopt a custom identified with the character of immodest women. Dishonoureth her head. Calvin, with terse good sense, observes, \"As the man honours his head by proclaiming his liberty, so the woman by acknowledging her subjection.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let her also be shorn. Not a command, but, a sort of scornful inference, or reductio ad absurdum. If it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven. When a woman was tried by \"the ordeal of the water of jealousy,\" her head was uncovered by the priest (Numbers 5:18). To be shorn or shaven was a sign of mourning (Deuteronomy 21:12), and was a disgrace inflicted on adulteresses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He is the image and glory of God. Because he reflects and partakes in the glory of Christ, who is the effulgence of God and the impress of his substance (Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:6; Hebrews 1:2). The woman is the glory of the man. As moonlight is to sunlight, or as the earthshine is to the moonshine. Man reflects God; woman, in her general nature in this earthly and temporal dispensation, reflects the glory of man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But the woman of the man.

As is expressly stated in Genesis 2:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - To have power on her head. A great deal of irrelevant guesswork has been written on this verse. Under this head must be classed the idle attempts to twist the word exousia, power, or authority, into some other reading - an attempt which may be set aside, because it is not sanctioned by a single manuscript. We may also dismiss the futile efforts to make exousia have any other primary meaning than \"authority.\" The context shows that the word has here a secondary sense, and implies some kind of covering. The verse, therefore, points the same lessons as Genesis 24:64, 65. This much may be regarded as certain, and this view is adopted by the steadfast good sense of our English translators, both in the Authorized and Revised Versions. The only question worth asking is why the word exousia had come at Corinth, or in the Corinthian Church, to be used for \"a veil,\" or \"covering.\" The simplest answer is that just as the word \"kingdom\" in Greek may be used for \"a crown\" (comp. regno as the name of the pope's tiara), so \"authority\" may mean \"a sign of authority\" (Revised Version), or \"a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband\" (Authorized Version, margin). The margin of the Revised Version, \"authority over her head,\" is a strange suggestion. Some have explained the word of her own true authority, which consists in accepting the rule of her husband; but it probably moans a sign of her husband's authority over her. Similarly the traveller Chardin says that in Persia the women wear a veil, in sign that they are \"under subjection.\" If so, the best comment on the word may be found in the exquisite lines of Milton, which illustrate the passage in other ways also -NEWLINENEWLINE\"She, as a vei1, down to the slender waistNEWLINEHer unadorned golden tresses wore...NEWLINEAs the vine curves her tendrils, which impliedNEWLINESubjection, but required with gentle sway,NEWLINEAnd by her yielded, by him best received.\" The fact that Callistratus twice uses exousia of \"abundance of hair\" is probably a mere coincidence, resembling the Irish expression \"a power of hair.\" Nor can there be any allusion to the isolated fact that Samson's strength lay in his hair. The very brief comment of Luther sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the subject. He says that exousia means \"the veil or covering, by which one may see that she is under her husband's authority\" (Genesis 3:16). Because of the angels. In this clause also we must set aside, as idle waste of time, the attempts to alter the text, or to twist the plain words into impossible meanings. The word \"angels\" cannot mean \"Church officials,\" or \"holy men,\" or \"prophets,\" or \"delegates,\" or \"'bridegroom's men,\" or anything but angels. Nor can the verse mean, as Bengel supposes, that women are to veil themselves because the angels do so (Isaiah 6:2), or (as Augustine says) because the angels approve of it. The only question is whether the allusion is to good or bad angels. In favour of the latter view isNEWLINENEWLINEthe universal tradition among the Jews that the angels fell by lust for mortal women, which was the Jewish way of interpreting Genesis 6:1, 2. This is the view of Tertullian ('De Virg. Vel.,' 7) in writing on this subject. A woman, in the opinion and traditions of Oriental Jews, is liable to injury from the shedim, if she appears in public unveiled; and these evil spirits are supposed to delight in the appearance of unveiled women. The objection to this view, that angeloi alone is never used of evil but always of good angels, is not perhaps decisive (see 1 Corinthians 6:3). The verse may, however, mean (in accordance with the Jewish belief of those days) that good angels, being under the possibility of falling from the same cause as their evil brethren, fly away at once from the presence of unveiled women. Thus Khadijah tested that the visitant of her husband Mohammed really was the angel Gabriel, because he disappeared the moment she unveiled her head. On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be, out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always invisibly present in the Christian assemblies. (On this point, see Luke 15:10; Ephesians 3:10; Hebrews 1:14; Hebrews 12:1; Ecclesiastes 5:6; Psalm 138:1 [LXX.]; Tobit 12:12. See Latimer's 'Sermons,' p. 253). \"Reverence the angels\" is St. Chrysostom's remark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Nevertheless.

St. Paul cuts the question short, as though impatient of any further discussion of a subject already settled by instinctive decorum and by the common sense of universal usage. \"Seem to be contentious\" is (like the Latin videtur) only a courteous way of saying \"is contentious.\" If any of you wish to be disputatious and quarrelsome about this minor matter of ritual, I must content myself with saying that he must take his own course (for a similar use of the euphemistic \"seem,\" see Philippians 3:4; Hebrews 4:1; James 1:26). We have no such custom. The emphatic \"we\" means the apostles and the leaders of the Church at Jerusalem and Antioch. Such custom. Not referring to \"contentiousness,\" but to the women appearing with uncovered heads. Neither the Churches of God. If you Corinthians prefer these abnormal practices in spite of reason, common sense, and my arguments, you must stand alone in your innovations upon universal Christian practice. But catholic custom is against your \"self opinionated particularism.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-34. - Discreditable irregularities at the Eucharist and the agapae.

The \"second\" rebuke is not clearly stated, but is no doubt meant to refer to the abuses in \"speaking with the tongue.\" In the Church; rather, in congregation, or assembly. The reference is not to a particular building. The Lord's Supper was administered frequently (originally every day, Acts 2:46), and often in private houses. Divisions; schisms (ch. 1:10, 12). Here, however, he is referring to cliques and quarrels at the love feasts. Partly! cannot think, he says, in a tone of kindness, that these reports are wholly false. There must be some ground for them, even if the facts have been exaggerated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - There must be also heresies among you. It results from the inevitable decrees of the Divine providence. \"It is impossible but that offences will come\" (Luke 17:11). Heresies. The word does not mean \"erroneous opinions,\" but party factions. Originally the word only means \"a choice,\" and is not used in a bad sense; but since the opinionativeness of men pushes \"a choice\" into a \"party,\" and since it is the invariable tendency of a party to degenerate into a \"faction,\" the word soon acquires a bad sense (see its use in Acts 5:17; Acts 15:5; Acts 24:5, 14: 28:22; Galatians 5:20; Titus 3:10; 2 Peter 2:1; and Gieseler, 'Church Hist.,' 1:149). The mutually railing factions, which in their Church newspapers and elsewhere bandy about their false and rival charges of \"heresy,\" are illustrating the virulence of the very sin which they are professing to denounce - the sin of factiousness. That they which are approved may be made manifest among you. Similarly St. John (1 John 2:19) speaks of the aberrations of false teachers as destined to prove that they did not belong to the true Church. Good is educed out of seeming evil (James 1:3; 1 Peter 1:6, 7).

There were as yet no churches. The Lord's Supper was held in private houses. This is not; or perhaps, it is not possible. The Lord's Supper. The fact that there is no article in the Greek shows the early prevalence of this name for the Eucharist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For in eating; rather, in your eating. Every one. All who have themselves contributed a share to the common meal. Taketh before other his own supper. It is as if they had come together only to eat, not to partake of a holy sacrament. The abuse rose from the connection of the Lord's Supper with the agape, or love feast, a social gathering of Christian brothers, to which each, as in the Greek eranoi, or \"club feasts,\" contributed his share. The abuse led to the separation of the agape from the Holy Communion, and ultimately to the entire disuse of the former at religious gatherings. One is hungry. The poor man, who has been unable to contribute to the meal which was intended to be an exhibition of Christian love, looked on with grudging eyes and craving appetite, while the rich had more than enough. Is drunken. \"St. Paul draws the picture in strong colours, and who can say that the reality was less strong?\" (Meyer). Calvin says, \"It is portentous that Satan should have accomplished so much in so short a time.\" But the remark was, perhaps, dictated by the wholly mistaken fancy that the Church of the apostolic days was exceptionally pure. On the contrary, many of the heathen converts were unable at once to break the spell of their old habits, and few modern Churches present a spectacle so deplorable as that which we here find in the apostolic Church of Corinth. It is quite obvious that Church discipline must have been almost in abeyance if such grave scandals could exist uncorrected and apparently unreproved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - To eat and to drink in. The object of the agape was something higher than the mere gratification of appetite. Though not a sacrament, it was an accompaniment of the Lord's Supper, and was itself intended to be a symbolical and sacred meal. Despise ye the Church of God! The congregation of your fellow Christians. Shame; rather, disgrace, or put to shame. Them that have not. It would be natural to supply \"houses.\" But the commentators found it difficult to suppose that any of the Corinthians had not \"houses to eat and to drink in.\" Hence most commentators give to the phrase its classic sense, in which \"those who have\" means the rich, and \"those who have not,\" the poor. They seem, however, to have forgotten that slaves at any rate could hardly be said to have \"houses of their own,\" and it is certain that not a few of the Corinthian Christians were slaves. I praise you not. As in ver. 17, this is an instance of what is called litotes, a mild expression, suggesting a meaning much stronger than the words themselves. For. He is about to give his reason for thus strongly blaming their irregularities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I have received; rather, I received. He thus refers the revelation to some special time, and this seems to point to the conclusion that he is not referring to any account of the institution of the Lord's Supper, which may have been given him by St. Peter or one of the twelve, but to some immediate revelation from Christ. The terms in which he describes the institution of the Eucharist resemble most nearly those of St. Luke, who may very probably have derived his information from St. Paul. This passage should be compared with Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:19, 20. Was betrayed; rather, was being betrayed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - When he had given thanks. The same word is used in St. Luke εὐχαριστήσας), and is the origin of the name Eucharist. St. Mark and perhaps St. Matthew have \"having blessed it\" (eulogesas). Hence the Eucharist is \"this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.\" Take, eat. These words are omitted by all the best uncials, Which is broken for you. The word \"broken\" is of doubtful authenticity. Some manuscripts have \"given,\" and one (D) a milder word for \"broken,\" as though to avoid any contradiction of John 19:36, where, however, the word is \"shall not be crushed.\" Since the participle is omitted altogether by א, A, B, C, there can be no doubt that it is a gloss, and accordingly the Revised Version reads, \"which is for you.\" The \"broken\" is nevertheless involved in the \"he brake it,\" which was a part of the ceremony as originally illustrated. The breaking of the bread ought not, therefore, to be abandoned, as in the case when \"wafers\" are used. This do. St. Luke also has this clause, which is not found in St. Matthew or St. Mark. The variations show that it was the main fact which was essential, not the exact words spoken. In remembrance of me. The words may also be rendered, for a memorial of me, or to bring me to your remembrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25 - When he had supped (see Luke 22:27). 'The cup, like the cos haberachah, was given after the meal was ended. The new testament; rather, the new covenant. The Greek word diatheke is indeed a \"will,\" or \"testament;\" but in the LXX., on which the Greek of the apostles was formed, it always stands for berith, covenant. The Jews knew nothing of the practice of \"making wills\" till they learnt it from the Romans. The only passage of the New Testament (an expression derived from this very passage through the Vulgate) in which diatheke means a \"testament\" is Hebrews 9:16, where the writer reverts for a moment only to this signification of the word to introduce a passing illustration. In my blood. The cup was a symbol of the blood of Christ, because the gospel covenant was ratified by the shedding of his blood. The Jews had an absolute horror, at once religious and physical, of tasting blood. This was the reason why the Synod of Jerusalem forbade even to the Gentiles the eating of \"things strangled.\" If the apostles had not fully understood that our Lord was only using the ordinary language of Semitic imagery, and describing only a horror and repulsion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Ye do show the Lord's death. The word literally means, ye announce, or proclaim, with reference to the repetition of the actual words used by our Lord. It will be seen that St. Paul does not lend the smallest, sanction to the unfathomable superstition\" of a material transubstantiation. Till he come. Accordingly the antiquity and unbroken continuance of this holy rite is one of the many strong external evidences of the truth of the gospel history. The α}ν is omitted in the Greek, to indicate the certainty of Christ's coming. The same Greek idiom is hopefully and tenderly used in Galatians 4:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And drink this cup. This ought to be rendered, or drink this cup. It seems to be one of the extremely few instances in which the translators of our Authorized Version were led by bias into unfaithful rendering. They may have persuaded themselves that the apostle must have meant \"and;\" but their duty as translators was to translate what he said, not what they supposed him to have meant. What he meant was that it was possible to partake in a wrong spirit either of the bread or the cup. King James's translators thought that, by rendering the word or, they might seem to favour communion in one kind only. St. Paul's meaning was that a man might Lake either element of the sacrament unworthily. Unworthily. We are all \"unworthy\" - \" unworthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under Christ's table;\" yet not one of us need eat or drink unworthily, that is, in a careless, irreverent, defiant spirit. Guilty of.

The verb means \"let him test his own feelings;\" put them to the proof, to see whether they be sincere or not. He must \"wash his hands in innocency,\" and so come to God's altar (see Matthew 5:22, 23; 2 Corinthians 13:5). And so. Soberly, that is; seriously, humbly, and with due reverence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Unworthily. The word is not genuine here, being repeated from ver. 27; it is omitted by א, A, B, C. Eateth and drinketh damnation to himself; rather, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself There is reason to believe that the word \"damnation\" once had a much milder meaning in English than that which it now popularly bears. In King James's time it probably did not of necessity mean more than \"an unfavourable verdict.\" Otherwise this would be the most unfortunate mistranslation in the whole Bible. It has probably kept thousands, as it kept Goethe, from Holy Communion. We see from ver. 32 that this \"judgment\" had a purely merciful and disciplinary character. Not discerning; rather, if he discern not, the Lord's body, Any one who approach? the Lord's Supper in a spirit of levity or defiance, not discriminating between it and common food, draws on himself, by so eating and drinking, a judgment which is defined in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Many are weak and sickly among you. St. Paul directly connects this general ill health with the abuse of the Lord's Supper. It is not impossible that the grave intemperance to which he alludes in ver. 21 may have had its share in this result; but apart from this, there is an undoubted connection between sin and sickness in some, though not, of course, in all cases (John 5:14). Many.

They should be rendered (literally), For if we discerned (or, discriminated) ourselves, we should not be undergoing judgment (namely, of physical punishment); but, in being judged by the Lord (by these temporal sufferings), we are under training, that we may not be condemned with the world. The meaning is that \"if we\" (St. Paul here identities himself with the Corinthians) \"were in the habit of self discernment - and in this self discrimination is involved a discrimination between spiritual and common things - we should nut be undergoing this sign of God's displeasure; but the fact that his judgments are abroad among us is intended to further our moral education, and to save us from being finally condemned with the world.\" Discernment (diakrisis), by saving us from eating unworthily (Psalm 32:5; 1 John 1:9), would have obviated the necessity for penal judgments (krima), but yet the krima is disciplinary (paideuometha, we are being trained as children), to save us from final doom (katakrima). Unworthy eating, then, so far from involving necessary or final \"damnation,\" is mercifully visited by God with temporal chastisement, to help in the saving of our souls. \"Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord\" (Psalm 94:12; Hebrews 12:5-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians11:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Wherefore.

A reminder of the sacred character of the agape as a symbol of Christian love and union. Unto condemnation; rather, judgment. In Greek, the same word (krima) is used which in ver. 29 is so unhappily rendered \"damnation.\" But even \"condemnation\" is too strong; for that is equivalent to katakrima. The rest; all minor details. It is not improbable that one of these details was the practical dissociation of the agape from the Lord's Supper altogether. Certainly the custom of uniting the two seems to have disappeared by the close of the first century. When I come; rather, whenever. The Greek phrase (ὡς α}ν) implies uncertainty. The apostle's plans for visiting Corinth immediately had been materially disturbed by the unfavourable tidings as to the conditions of the Church.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-11. - On spiritual gifts in general. Verse 1. - Now concerning spiritual gifts; rather, things spiritual. The context, however, shows that St. Paul is thinking almost exclusively of the gifts (charismata) of the Spirit. I would not have you ignorant (see 1 Corinthians 10:1). The Corinthians had doubtless inquired in their letter as to the views of the apostle on this important and difficult subject.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That ye were Gentiles. The undoubted reading is, that when ye were Gentiles. The sentence is then in form an anacoluthon; in other words, it is not grammatically finished. The ancients were much less particular about these small matters of precision and symmetry than the moderns; and writers who are deeply moved by their subject, and hurried along by the strength of their feelings, often fall into these unfinished constructions (see Romans 2:17-21; Romans 15:25-27; Galatians 2:6; 2 Thessalonians 2:3, etc., in the Greek). Dumb idols. This characteristic of idols (Habakkuk 2:18; Psalm 115:5; Psalm 135:16) is fixed upon to show that their \"oracles\" were mere falsity and pretence. We find an illustration of the epithet in the statue of Isis at Pompeii, where the ruined temple shows the secret stair by which the priest mounted to the back of the statue; and the head of the statue (preserved in the Museo Borbonico) shows the tube which went from the back of the head to the parted lips. Through this tube the priest concealed behind the statue spoke the answers of Isis. Even as ye were led; rather, howsoever ye might be led, as in the Revised Version. The Greek phrase shows that, under the oracular guidance of dumb idols, the Gentiles had been, as it were, drifted hither and thither \"as the winds listed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Wherefore. Their previous condition of Gentile ignorance rendered it necessary to instruct them fully respecting the nature and discrimination of the charisms of the Spirit. By the Spirit of God; rather, in the Spirit; i.e. in the state of spiritual exaltation and ecstasy. The phrase is a Hebrew one to describe inspiration. Jesus accursed. It may well seem amazing that the Corinthians should need instructing that such awful language could not be uttered by any one speaking \"in the Spirit of God.\" It is evident, however, that such expressions had been uttered by persons who were, or seemed to be, carried away by the impassioned impulse which led to \"glossolaly.\" (It is better to use this technical word in order to dissipate the cloud of strange misconceptions as to the true nature of this charism.) So terrible an outrage on the conscience of Christians could never have passed unchecked and unpunished, except from the obvious inability of the young community to grapple with the new and perplexing phenomena of an \"inspiration\" which appeared to destroy the personal control of those possessed by it. Among Jewish converts glossolaly was regarded as a form of that wild mantle \"inspiration\" of which we find some traces in Jewish history (1 Samuel 10:10, 11; 1 Samuel 18:10; 1 Samuel 19:23, 24, etc.), and which was alluded to in the very name Nabo, which implied a boiling energy. Among Gentile converts the glossolaly would be classed with the overmastering influences of which they read, or which they witnessed, in the Sibyls, the Pythian priestesses, and the wild orgiastic devotees of Eastern cults. They would not like to call any one to task for things spoken in a condition which they regarded as wholly supernatural. As to the speakers,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) some of them, not being sincere, might have really fallen under the influence of impulses which were earthly and demonish, not Divine;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) others, not duly controlling their own genuine impulse, may have been liable to the uncontrolled sway of utterances for which they were at the moment irresponsible;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) or again, being incapable of reasoned expression, they may have audibly expressed vague Gnostic doubts as to the identity of the \"Jesus\" who was crucified and the Divine Word; orNEWLINENEWLINE(4) they may have been entangled in Jewish perplexities rising from Deuteronomy 21:23, \"He that is hanged\" (which was also the expression applied by Jews to the crucified) \"is accursed of God;\" or finally,NEWLINENEWLINE(5) by some strange abuse of the true principle expressed by St. Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:16, they may have asserted in this fearful form their emancipation from the acknowledgment of Jesus \"after the flesh.\" Similar phenomena - the same intrusions into worship of downright blasphemy or of blasphemous familiarity - have constantly recurred at times of overwhelming spiritual excitement, as for instance m the adherents of the \"everlasting gospel\" in the thirteenth century, and in various movements of our own day. Is accursed; rather, is anathema. The word corresponds to the Hebrew cherem, which means \"a ban,\" and \"what is devoted or set apart by a ban;\" and to the Latin sacer, which means not only \"sacred,\" set apart by holy consecration, but also \"devoted to destruction.\" No man can say that Jesus is [the] Lord, but by [in] the Holy Ghost. It involved a strong rebuke to the illuminati, who professed a profound spiritual insight, to tell them that no man could make the simple, humble confession of the divinity of Jesus (for \"Lord\" is here an equivalent of the Hebrew \"Jehovah\") except by the same inspiration as that which they so terribly abused. There is a very similar passage in 1 John 1:2; but there the \"test\" of the inspiration is a confession of the humanity of Jesus as against Gnostics, who treated his human life as purely phantasmal. Here the test is the confession of his divinity as against Jews and Gentiles. (For a parallel passage, see Matthew 16:17, \"Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Diversities. This word is used in each of these verses. Gifts; charismata; endowments imparted by the Holy Spirit. The word is rendered \"free gift\" in Romans 5:13. The same Spirit. The gifts of the Spirit are not uniform, but display diversity in unity Just as the sunlight playing on different surfaces produces a multiplicity of gleams and colours, so the Holy Spirit manifests his presence variously, and even sometimes with sharp contrasts, in different individualities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Administrations.

He is the Sun of the whole universe, and always in the meridian; and from him, as the Father of lights, flows every good and perfect gift (James 1:17). It will be seen that this is one of the many passages which teach with perfect clearness the doctrine of the Trinity in unity. All in all (for this expression, see ch. 15:28; Ephesians 1:23). There are very similar passages descriptive of the diversity in unity of God's dispensations, in Ephesians 4:4-6, 11, 12; Romans 12:6-8; 1 Peter 4:10, 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - To profit withal.

In modern usage, \"knowledge\" is the learning which we by use and effort acquire; \"wisdom\" is the insight which gradually dawns upon us from thought and experience. In the language of the New Testament, the distinction between the two words is not so clearly marked, but\" wisdom\" seems to belong more to the human spirit, and \"knowledge \"to the intellect. The \"discourse of wisdom\" would be that which sets forth the truth of the gospel persuasively to work conversion (1 Corinthians 2:6, 7); the \"discourse of knowledge\" would be that which enters into the speculative and theoretical elaboration of systematic theology. The first might find its illustration in the 'Imitatio Christi;' the second in the 'Summa Theologiae.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - To another.

St. Paul probably uses the phrases \"to one\" and \"to another\" (α}λλῳ δὲ... ἑτέρῳ δὲ) merely for variety of style (as in Hebrews 11:35, 36), with no very definite classification in view, as he does not mention all the charisma (see ver. 28). Faith. Faith in its highest energy, as a supernatural power; the faith that removes mountains (Matthew 17:19, 20). The gifts of healing. Not, that is, by medical knowledge, but by supernatural power (Mark 16:18; Acts 5:15, 16; James 5:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The working of miracles; literally, active, efficacy of powers; such as \"the signs of an apostle,\" to which St. Paul himself appealed in 2 Corinthians 12:12, which included \"wonders and mighty powers\" (comp. Romans 15:18). Prophecy. Not \"prediction,\" but elevated and inspired discourse; the power of preaching to edification. Discerning of spirits; rather, discernings, or powers to discriminate between true and false spirits. It was necessary in those days of intense enthusiasm and spiritual awakenment to \"test the spirits, whether they be of God\" (1 John 4:1). There were such things as \"deceitful spirits\" which spoke \"doctrines of devils\" (l Timothy 4:1; Revelation 2:1, 2; see 1 Corinthians 14:29). Divers kinds of tongues. There is no need for the word \"divers.\" The particular variety of the ecstatic, and often entirely unintelligible, utterance known as \"the tongue\" differed with the individuality or temperament of the speaker. Recent lines of research, by that historical method which can alone furnish correct results, have led to the conclusion that, whatever may be thought of the \"tongues\" on the day of Pentecost (which is a separate question), the \"tongue\" spoken of (for the most part with relative disparagement) by St. Paul as a charism of the Spirit was closely analogous to that wild, rapt, unconscious, uncontrollable utterance which, with varying details, has always occurred in the religious movements which stir the human soul to its utmost depths. The attempts to explain the word \"tongues\" as meaning \"foreign languages,\" or \"the primeval language,\" or \"poetic and unusual phraseology,\" etc., are baseless and exploded. The notion that by this gift the early Christians knew languages which they had never acquired, is not only opposed to the entire analogy of God's dealings, but to every allusion in the New Testament (except a prima facie but untenable view of the meaning of Acts 2:4) and to every tradition and statement of early Christian history. The apostles (so far as we have any record of their missionary work in the New Testament) had not the slightest need to acquire foreign languages. Since Palestine was at this epoch bilingual, they could all speak Aramaic and Greek, and therefore could address Jews and Gentiles throughout the civilized world. Every single allusion which St. Paul makes to this subject excludes the possibility of the supposition of a miracle so utterly useless and meaningless, so subversive of every psychological consideration, and so alien from the analogy of all God's methods, as the talking in unacquired foreign languages by persons who did not understand them. The interpretation of tongues. Sometimes, but not always (1 Corinthians 14:13), the speaker, on relapsing from his ecstasy, was able to express his outburst of unintelligible soliloquy in the form of reasoned thought When he was unable to do so, St. Paul ordains that another should convey in ordinary language the impressions left by the inspired rhapsody (1 Corinthians 14:27-29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - One and the selfsame Spirit. The unity of the source from which all the charisms flowed ought to have excluded the possibility of a boastful comparison of gifts, arid all depreciation of those gifts which, because they were less dazzling, were deemed inferior. St. Paul afterwards shows that the less dazzling might be infinitely the more valuable for purposes of spiritual edification.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-31. - The Church compared to a body and its members. Verse 12. - As the body is one, and hath many members. To this favourite image St. Paul reverts several times (Romans 12:4, 5; Ephesians 4:11-16; Colossians 2:19). It is probable that he was familiar with the image from the fable of Menenius Agrippa, who had used it as a plea for civil unity (Liv., 2:32). So also is Christ. Christ and the Church form one body, of which Christ is the Head; one Vine, of which Christians are the branches (John 15.); one building, of which Christians are the living stones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - By one Spirit; rather, in one Spirit. The diffusion of one spirit is the clement of unity. Are we all baptized; rather, we were all baptized. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free. Moreover, as these were national and social differences, they were all obliterated by baptism, which made us all equal members of one holy brotherhood (Galatians 3:28). Have been all made to drink into one Spirit. The word \"into\" is probably spurious. We have all been given to drink of one Spirit, which is as the outpouring of living water (Acts 10:45; John 7:37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the body is not one member, but many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - If the foot shall say, etc. So Seneca says, \"What if the hands should wish to injure the feet, or the eyes the hands? As all the members agree together because it is the interest of the whole that each should be kept safe, so men spare their fellow men because we are born for heaven, and society cannot be saved except by the love and protection of its elements\" ('De Ira,' 2:31). And Marcus Aurelius: \"We have been born for mutual help, like the feet, like the hands, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.

All are not equal in strength and delicacy, but each is happy, and each is necessary to the well being of all. There could be no better image of the ideal relation of Christians to each other and to the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - As it hath pleased him.

The shelter and ornament of clothing are used to cover those parts of the body which are conventionally regarded as the least seemly. The whole of this illustration is meant to show that rich and poor, great and small, high and low, gifted and ungifted, have all their own separate and indispensable functions, and no class of Christians can wisely disparage or forego the aid derived from other and different classes. The unity of the members in one body corresponds to \"the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace\" which should prevail in the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - No schism in the Body. What is exclusively called \"schism\" is not necessarily such. There may be difference of fold in the one flock. There may be no real discord or dissension, though there may be varieties of ecclesiastical government. Unity, as the whole argument shows, does not demand the existence of uniformity. That the members should have the same care one for another. Thus the early believers \"were of one heart and of one soul;\" and the moment that a complaint arose that one of the weakest and smallest interests was neglected, the supposed neglect was amply remedied (Acts 4:32; Acts 6:1-6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it, etc. St. Chrysostom illustrates this verse by saying that if a thorn runs into the heel, the whole body feels it and is troubled; and that, on the ether hand, if the head is garlanded, the whole man is glorified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. Each Church is a sort of microcosm of the whole Church.

First apostles. Apart from the twelve (Luke 6:13) and Paul and Barnabas, the name was in a lower sense extended to leading and eminent Christians, especially to those who had taken part in founding or ruling Churches (Romans 16:7). Prophets. Wise spiritual preachers. It is instructive to note that St. Paul places the gifts of wisdom and knowledge which these preachers require above those which we are apt to regard as exclusively miraculous. The \"wonders\" stood in a lower, not in a higher, position when compared with the ordinary gifts of grace. Teachers. Those who have the minor gifts of instruction and exposition (Acts 13:1). Helps. All the services rendered by the power of active sympathy; by the work of deacons, sisters of mercy, etc. (Acts 6:3, 4). The word occurs in 2 Macc. 8:19; Ecclus. 11:12, and the corresponding verb in Acts 20:35; 1 Timothy 6:2; Luke 1:54; see Romans 16:3. Governments. Powers of leading and organization. Diversities [kinds] of tongues. Ranked as last in value. They are emotional gifts, which had only a very subordinate part in the work of edification, and are, therefore, placed below the gifts of knowledge, of power, and of practical life, which sum up the previous enumeration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Are all apostles? etc. It is God's providence which \"has appointed divers orders in his Church,\" and has \"ordained and constituted the services of angels and of men in a wonderful order.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians12:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Covet earnestly; literally, be zealous for, strongly desire. That which we aim at we usually attain; and we should aim at that which really is, not at that which seems, the most splendid charism. And yet show I unto you a more excellent way. The \"more excellent way\" is the way of love, which he sets forth in the next chapter, and which lies open to all Christians without distinction. The verse means either, \"And further\" (besides bidding you aim at the better gifts), \"I show you one supreme way of attaining them;\" or, \"And I show you a still more eminent way.\" I bid you desire the best gifts, and further show you a truly royal road (viam maxime vialem), a road par excellence, which leads to their attainment. The way of love would lead to them, and it was itself the best of them. \"All the way to heaven lies through heaven, and the path to heaven is heaven.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-13. - The supremely excellent way of Christian love. This chapter has been in all ages the object of the special admiration of the Church. Would that it had received in all ages the loftier and more valuable admiration which would have been expressed by an acceptance of its lessons! Tertullian says that it is uttered \"with all the force of the Spirit\" (totis Spiritus viribus). It is a glorious hymn or paean in honour of Christian love, in which St. Paul rises on the wings of inspiration to the most sunlit heights of Christian eloquence. Like the forty-fifth psalm, it may be entitled \"A Psalm of Love.\" Valcknaer says that the \"oratorical figures which illuminate the chapter have been born spontaneously in an heroic soul, burning with the love of Christ, and placing all things lower than this Divine love.\" In vers. 1-3 he shows the absolute necessity for love; in vers. 4-7 its characteristics; in vers. 8-12 its eternal permanence; in ver. 13 its absolute supremacy. Verse 1. - Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels. The case is merely supposed. The tongues of men are human languages, including, perhaps, the peculiar utterance of ecstatic inspiration with which he is now dealing. It is, perhaps, with reference to this latter result of spiritual exultation, at any rate in its purest and loftiest developments, that he adds the words, \"and of angels.\" It is unlikely that he is referring to the rabbinic notion that the angels only understood Hebrew, and not Aramaic or other languages. The words are meant to express the greatest possible climax. The most supreme powers of utterance, even of angelic utterance - if any of the Corinthians had or imagined that they had attained to such utterance - are nothing in comparison with the universally possible attainment of Christian love. It is remarkable that here again he places \"tongues,\" even in their grandest conceivable development, on the lowest step in his climax. And have not charity. It is deeply to be regretted that the translators of the Authorized Version here introduced from the Vulgate a new translation for the sacred word \"love,\" which dominates the whole New Testament as its Divine keynote. Greek possesses two words for \"love.\" One of these, eros, implying as it did the love which springs from sensual passion, was dyed too deeply in pagan associations to be capable of redemption into holier usage. It is characteristic of the difference between paganism and Christianity, that Plato's eulogy in the 'Symposium' is in honour of eros, not of anything resembling agape. The apostles, therefore, were compelled to describe the ideal of the gospel life by another word, which expressed the love of esteem and reverence and sacred tenderness - the word agape. This word was not indeed classical. No heathen writer had used it. But the verb agapao, corresponding to the Latin diligo, and bring reserved for this loftier kind of love, suggested at once the substantive agape, which, together with the similar substantive agapesis (Jeremiah 31:3, etc.), had already been adopted by the LXX. and by Philo and in Wisd. 3:9. The word is thus, as Archbishop Trench says, \"born in the bosom of revealed religion\" ('New Testament Synonyms,' p. 41). The Vulgate chose caritas (whence our \"charity\") to express this love of reason and affection, the dearness which reigns between human beings, and between man and God. This word, like agape, is absolutely unstained with any evil association. If \"charity\" had been exclusively used for agape, no objection need have arisen, although \"love\" is English while \"charity\" is Latin. But it was an Unmixed evil that, by the use of two different words for the same Greek word, English readers should have been prevented from recognizing the unity of thought on this subject which prevails among all the books of the New Testament (Matthew 22:37-40; 1 Peter 1:22; 1 John 3:14; 1 John 4:7, 8, etc.). To argue that the word \"love\" in English is not unmingled with unhallowed uses is absurd, because those uses of the word have never been supposed for a single moment to intrude into multitudes of other passages where love is used to render agape. Who has ever dreamed of objecting on such grounds to the favourite hymn? -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Faith and Hope and Love we seeNEWLINEJoining hand in hand agree;NEWLINEBut the greatest of the threeNEWLINEAnd the best is Love.\" It is true that Lord Bacon admired \"the discretion and tenderness of the Rhenish Version\" in using the word \"charitie,\" \"because of the indifferencies and equivocation of the word [love] with impure love.\" But that objection, if it ever existed, has now been done away with by the use of \"love\" in such a multitude of other pure and lofty passages of Holy Writ. It is, therefore, a great gain that the Revised Version restored to this passage the word \"love,\" which had been used by Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva Bible. For in modern English usage the word \"charity\" is almost confined to \"almsgiving,\" and that of a kind which is often made an excuse for shirking all real self denial, and for not acting up to the true spirit of love. Christian love is always and infinitely blessed, but the almsgiving which has usurped the name of \"charity\" often does more harm than good. I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal; more literally, I have become booming brass, or clanging cymbal. My \"tongues\" without \"love\" become a mere discordant, obtrusive, unintelligible dissonance. The Greek word for \"clanging\" (alalazon) is an onomatopoeia, like the Hebrew name for cymbals, tseltselim (Psalm 150:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Prophecy. The power of lofty utterance belonged to Balaam and Caiaphas; yet it availed them nothing without love. \"Lord, Lord,\" exclaim the troubled souls at the left hand, \"have we not prophesied in thy Name?\" Yet he answers them,\" I never knew you.\" All mysteries. Though I can speak of the secrets of God once hidden but now revealed (Matthew 13:11; Romans 16:27; 1 Corinthians 2:7; Ephesians 3:3, etc.). And all knowledge. Insight into the deeper meanings of Scripture, etc. All faith. Not here meaning \"justifying faith,\" or \"saving faith,\" which can no more exist without showing itself in works than light can exist without heat; but fides miraculosa, reliance on the power to work wonders. Judas, for instance, must have possessed this kind of faith, and it was exercised by \"many\" who will yet be rejected because they also work iniquity (Matthew 7:21-23). So that I could remove mountains. It has been supposed that this must be a reference to Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21. It is, however, much more probable that, if St. Paul derived the words from our Lord, they came to him by oral tradition. And the inference must in any case be precarious, for the phrase was so common among the rabbis that \"remover of mountains\" was one of their admiring titles for a great teacher. I am nothing. No expression could 'involve a more forcible rebuke to intellectual and spiritual pride.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor. The five words, \"bestow to feed the poor,\" represent the one Greek word psomiso, and after all do not give its force. It is derived from psomion, a mouthful, and so means \"give away by mouthfuls,\" i.e. \"dole away.\" It occurs in Romans 12:20 for \"feed.\" Attention to this verse might have served as a warning against the often useless and sometimes even pernicious doles of mediaeval monasteries. Much of the \"charity\" of these days is even more uncharitable than this, and shows the most complete absence of true charity; as for instance the dropping of pennies to professional beggars, and so putting a premium on vice and imposture. To be burned. The reading is extremely uncertain. The change of a letter gives the reading, that I may glory (καυχήσωμαι for καυθήσωμαι). Perhaps the scribes thought that \"death by burning\" was as yet (A.D. 57) an unheard of form of martyrdom, though it became but too familiar ten or twelve years later in the Neronian persecution. St. Paul was, however, probably referring, not, as some have supposed, to branding, which would bare been expressed differently, but to the case of the \"three children,\" in Daniel 3:23, where the LXX. has, \"They gave their bodies into the fire;\" or to the various tortures and deaths by fire in 2 Macc. 7. At the burning of Ridley and Latimer, Dr. Smith chose this verse for his text. Its applicability is on a par with millions of other instances in which Scripture has been grossly abused by employing its letter to murder its spirit, and by taking it from the God of love to give it to the devil of religious hatred. The burning of a saint was a singular specimen of the Church's \"love.\" It profiteth me nothing; literally, I am nothing benefited. A consideration of this verse might have shown the Christians of the early centuries that there was nothing intrinsically redemptive in the martyrdom into which they often thrust themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCharity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - The attributes of love. Verse 4. Suffereth long, and is kind. Passively it endures; actively it does good. It endures evils; it confers blessings. Envieth not. Its negative characteristics are part of its positive perfection. Envy - \"one shape of many names\" - includes malice, grudge, jealousy, pique, an evil eye, etc., with all their base and numerous manifestations. Vaunteth not itself. The meaning would probably be most nearly expressed by the colloquialism, does not show off. It does not, for instance, \"do its alms before men to be seen of them\" (Matthew 6:1). The Latin perperus, which is from the same root as this word, means \"a braggart,\" or \"swaggerer.\" Cicero, speaking of a grand oratorical display of his own before Pompey, says to Atticus, \"Good heavens! how I showed myself off (ἐνεπερπερευσάμην) before my new hearer, Pompeius!\" ('Ad. Art.,' 1:14). Is not puffed up. Has no purse proud or inflated arrogance.\" Love, therefore, is free from the characteristic vice of the Corinthian Church (1 Corinthians 4:6, 18, 19; 1 Corinthians 5:2; 1 Corinthians 8:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Doth not behave itself unseemly (see 1 Corinthians 12:23; 1 Corinthians 14:40). Vulgar indecorum is alien from love, as having its root in selfishness and want of sympathy. \"Noble manners\" are ever the fruit of \"noble minds.\" \"Be courteous\" (1 Peter 3:8). Seeketh not her own. Self seeking is the root of All evil (1 Corinthians 10:24, 33; Philippians 2:4; Romans 15:1, 2). Is not easily provoked. The word \"easily\" is here a gloss. The corresponding substantive (paroxusmos, whence our \"paroxysm\") is used of the sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas (Acts 15:39). Love, when it is perfected, rises superior to all temptations to growing exasperated, although it may often be justly indignant. But, as St. Chrysostom says, \"As a spark which falls into the sea hurts not the sea, but is itself extinguished, so an evil thing befalling a loving soul will be extinguished without disquietude.\" Thinketh no evil; literally, doth not reckon (or, impute) the evil. The phrase seems to be a very comprehensive one, implying that love is neither suspicious, nor implacable, nor retentive in her memory of evil done. Love writes our personal wrongs in ashes or in water.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Rejoiceth not in iniquity; rather, at unrighteousness. The rejoicing at sin, the taking pleasure in them that commit sin, the exultation over the fall of others into sin, are among the worst forms of malignity (Romans 1:32; 2 Thessalonians 2:12). The Greeks had a word, ἐπιχαιρεκακία, to describe \"rejoicing at the evil\" (whether sin or misfortune) of others (Proverbs 24:17); Schadenfreude, \"malignant joy\" (Arist., 'Eth.,' 2:7, 15). It is the detestable feeling indicated by the remark of La Rochefoucald, \"that there is something not altogether disagreeable to us in the misfortunes of our best friends.\" Rejoiceth in the truth; rather, with the truth. There are many who \"resist the truth\" (2 Timothy 3:8); or who \"hold the truth in unrighteousness\" (Romans 1:18); but love accepts it, keeps it pure, exults in all its triumphs (Acts 11:23 2John 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Beareth all things (see on 1 Corinthians 9:12). Endures wrongs and evils, and covers them with a beautiful reticence. Thus love \"covereth all sins\" (Proverbs 10:12; 1 Peter 4:8). Believeth all things. Takes the best and kindest views of all men and all circumstances, as long as it is possible to do so. It is the opposite to the common spirit, which drags everything in deteriorem partem, paints it in the darkest colours, and makes the worst of it. Love is entirely alien from the spirit of the cynic, the pessimist, the ecclesiastical rival, the anonymous slanderer, the secret detractor. Hopeth all things. Christians seem to have lost sight altogether of the truth that hope is something more than the result of a sanguine temperament, that it is a gift and a grace. Hope is averse to sourness and gloom. It takes sunny and cheerful views of man, of the world, and of God, because it is a sister of love. Endureth all things. Whether the \"seventy times seven\" offences of a brother (Luke 17:4), or the wrongs of patient merit (2 Timothy 2:24), or the sufferings and self. denials and persecutions of the life spent in doing good (2 Timothy 2:10). The reader need hardly he reminded that in these verses he has a picture of the life and character of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCharity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-13. - The eternal permanence of love. Verse 8. - Never faileth. The word \"faileth\" (ἐκπίπτει) has two technical meanings between which it is not easy to decide.NEWLINENEWLINE1. It means, technically, \"is never hissed off the stage like a bad actor,\" i.e. it has its part to play even on the stage of eternity. This is its meaning in classic Greek.NEWLINENEWLINE2. it means \"falls away\" like the petals of a withered flower (as in James 1:11; comp. Isaiah 28:4). Here, perhaps, the meaning is not technical, but general, as in Romans 9:6 and in the LXX. (Job 21:43). But the reading may be simply πίπτει (falleth), as in א, A,B,C. They shall fail. This is not the same word as the one on which we have been commenting; it means \"shall be annulled\" or \"done away;\" and is the same verb as that rendered in the next clauses by \"vanish away,\" \"be done away\" (ver. 10), and \"put away\" (ver. 11). Thus in two verses we have the same word rendered by four different phrases. No doubt the effect of the change sounds beautifully to ears accustomed to the \"old familiar strain;\" but it is the obvious duty of translators to represent, not to improve upon, the language of their author. In the Revised Version the stone word is rightly kept for the four recurrences of the verb. Tongues. Special charisms are enumerated to show the transcendence of love. Knowledge. This shall be only annulled in the sense of earthly knowledge, which shall be a star disappearing in the light of that heavenly knowledge which shall gradually broaden into the perfect day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we know in part, and we prophesy in part.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - We know in part.

But when I became a man, I put away childish things; now that I am become a man, I have done away with childish things. No specific time at which he put away childish things is alluded to, but he means that \"manhood\" is a state in which childishness should have become impossible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Through a glass; rather, through (or, by means of) a mirror. Our \"glasses\" were unknown in that age. The mirrors were of silver or some polished metal, giving, of course, a far dimmer image than \"glasses\" do. The rabbis said that \"all the prophets saw through a dark mirror, but Moses through a bright one.\" St. Paul says that no human eye can see God at all except as an image seen as it were behind the mirror. Darkly; rather, in a riddle. God is said to have spoken to Moses \"by means of riddles\" (Numbers 12:8; Authorized Version, \"in dark speeches\"), Human language, dealing with Divine facts, can only represent them indirectly, metaphorically, enigmatically, under human images, and as illustrated by visible phenomena. God can only be represented under the phrases of anthropomorphism and anthropopathy; and such phrases can only have a relative, not an absolute, truth. Then; i.e. \"when the perfect is come.\" Face to face. Like the \"mouth to mouth\" of the Hebrew and the LXX. in Numbers 12:8. This is the beatific vision. \"We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is\" (1 John 3:2). \"Now we walk by faith, not by sight\" (2 Corinthians 5:7). Then shall I know even as also I am known; rather, then shall I fully know even as also I was fully known, viz. when Christ took knowledge of me at my conversion. Now, we do not so much \"know\" God, but \"rather are known of God\" (comp. 1 Corinthians 8:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And now. The \"now\" is not temporal (as opposed to the \"then\" of the previous verse), but logical. It sums up the paragraph. Abideth. These three graces are fundamental and permanent; not transient, like the charisms, on which the Corinthians were priding themselves, but which should all be \"annulled.\" Faith, hope, charity. It might be difficult to see how \"hope\" should be permanent. But if the future state be progressive throughout eternity and infinitude, hope will never quite be lost in fruition. Even \"within the veil,\" it will still remain as \"an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast\" (Hebrews 6:19). The greatest of these is charity; more literally, greater than these is love. St. Paul does not explain why love is the greatest and best of the three. Various reasons may be given.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Love is the greatest, because it is the root of the other two; \"we believe only in that which we love; we hope only for that which we love.NEWLINENEWLINE2. And love is the greatest because love is for our neighbours; faith and hope mainly for ourselves.NEWLINENEWLINE3. And love is the greatest because faith and hope are human, but God is love.NEWLINENEWLINE4. And love is the greatest because faith and hope can only work by love, and only show themselves by love. Thus love is as the undivided perfection of sevenfold light. Faith and hope are precious stones of one colour, as a ruby and a sapphire; but love, as he has been showing us throughout the chapter, is a diamond of many facets.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFollow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-25. - The gift of preaching superior to the gift tongues.

The interpolation of the word \"unknown\" in our Authorized Version is quite unjustifiable, and shows the danger of giving way to the bias of mere conjectures. Probably it is this word, not found in the original, which has given rise to the perplexing, unhistoric, and unwarranted theory that \"the gift of tongues\" was a power of speaking in foreign languages. Speaketh not unto men. Because, as a rule, no one understands anything that he says. The word literally means \"hears.\" It may, perhaps, imply that no special attention was given to those who gave way to these impulses of utterance. The whole of this chapter proves in a most striking way the close analogy between \"the tongue\" and the impassioned soliloquies of inarticulate utterance which were poured forth in tones of thrilling power among the Montanists, and in modern times among the Irvingites. In the spirit. It is uncertain whether this means \"in his own spirit,\" or \"in the Spirit of God,\" i.e. as a result of inspiration. Probably the former (John 4:24; Romans 8:13, etc.). Perhaps, however, the two imply the same thing. The spirit is the one Divine part of our human being, and when a man is a true Christian his spirit is in union with, is as it were lost in, the Spirit of God. St. Paul recognizes the true tongue - for it might be simulated by hysteria and even by mere physical imposture - as a result of inspiration, that is, of the overpowering dominance of the human spirit by a supernatural power. Nevertheless, he points out the extreme peril of yielding to or self inducing these emotions public, or in leaving them uncontrolled. Mysteries. Secrets revealed possibly to him, but unrevealed by this strange \"tongue\" to others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To edification, and exhortation, and comfort. The \"to\" should be omitted. His words build up the Christian soul, by rousing its efforts and consoling its sorrows. The \"Son of prophecy\" (Barnabas) is, as Stanley points out, also \"a Son of consolation\" (Acts 4:36). \"Support\" (paraklesis) involves \"comfort,\" i.e. strength and calm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Edifieth himself. When the \"tongue\" was genuine, and under due control (ver. 32); when it avoided the physical and orgiastic manifestations by which a sort of spiritual possession was indicated in the ancient oracular shrines; when the self consciousness was not wholly obliterated, - a sense of ennobling conviction would be produced by this spiritual outpouring. Those who have experienced the emotion describe this very result. They felt enlarged and elevated - their whole being was for a time expanded - by this emotion. The Church. Primarily the body of assembled Christians which he is addressing, and through them the Church of God in general.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I would that ye all spake with tongues. The language of relative disparagement which St. Paul uses throughout these chapters may lead us to regard this with surprise. Yet it is perfectly intelligible. Montanus truly said that each human spirit is like a harp, which the Holy Spirit strikes as with a plectrum, and which yields itself to the mighty hand by which the chords are swept. We have seen all along - and history has in various ages confirmed the impression, on every occasion when these phenomena have been reproduced in seasons of great spiritual revival - that the external symptoms may be imitated with most dangerous and objectionable results both to the speaker and to others. But when the expression is genuine, the fact that the tides of the Spirit can thus sweep through the narrow channels of individuality is in itself a sign that the spirit of the man is alive and not dead; and thus he is an evidence of God's power both to himself and to others. Those who have heard \"the tongue\" have told me that its force, melody, and penetrative quality produced an impression not to be forgotten. When we see the stuffed and stopped-up hearts and lives of thousands of frivolous and worldly money worshippers, we might well echo St. Paul's wish. Greater. Not of necessity greater absolutely or morally, but greater in the fact of his wider and deeper usefulness. Except he interpret. From this we infer that sometimes, when the passion had spent its force, the speaker in the tongue could give rational explanation of the thoughts and feelings to which he had given ecstatic utterance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?

Much more is this the ease with the human voice.NEWLINENEWLINE\"How sour sweet music is,NEWLINEWhen time is broke and no proportion kept!\" The indiscriminate use of the tongue is here compared to the dissonance of jarring and unmodulated instrumental sounds, In harmony there must be due sequence and intervals of sound.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - If the trumpet give an uncertain sound.

The word \"chance\" itself (τυχὴ) does not occur in the New Testament. So many kinds of voices. This does not seem to mean \"so many languages.\" The Jews always asserted that the languages, of the world were seventy in number. It seems to mean \"classes of expressive sounds.\" None of them is without signification. The words rendered \"without signification,\" literally mean dumb.

Say Amen; rather, say the Amen. The custom of ratifying prayer and praises with the \"Amen\" of hearty assent and participation existed in the Jewish (Deuteronomy 27:15. Nehemiah 5:13; Revelation 5:14; Philo, 'Fragm.,' p. 630) as well as in the Christian Church (Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' 2:97). The sound of the loud unanimous \"Amen\" of early Christian congregations is compared to the echo of distant thunder.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Et resonaturum ferit aethera vocibus Amen.\" Being the answer of the congregation, the \"Amen\" was regarded as no less important than the prayer itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Well.

But it is clear from all that he has been saying that, while the personal and evidential value of this gift of yielding his whole being to the spiritual impulse, which expressed and relieved itself by inarticulate utterance, was such as to make him \"thank God\" that he possessed it, he must either have exercised it only in private gatherings or must have always accompanied it by interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Yet in the Church.

No disparagement of the prominence given to glossolaly could be more emphatic. \"Rather half of ten of the edifying sort than a thousand times ten of the other\" (Besser). That... I might [may] teach others also. The word rendered \"teach\" is rather instruct, the root of our \"catechize\" (Luke 1:4; Romans 2:8; Galatians 6:6, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBrethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Be not children in understanding; rather, in your minds. Your tendency to overvalue glossolaly shows you to be somewhat childish. It is remarkable that this is the only verse of the New Testament in which the common Greek word \"mind\" (phren) occurs. Howbeit in malice be ye children; better, but in wickedness be babes. The Authorized Version misses the climax involved in the change of the word. The Christian should always be childlike (Matthew 11:25; Matthew 19:4), but never childish (1 Corinthians 13:11; Ephesians 4:14). Be men; rather, become or prove yourselves full-grown; literally, perfect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - In the Law. The quotation is from Isaiah 28:11, 12, but the term \"the Law\" was applied generally to the Old Testament, as in John 10:34; John 12:34; John 15:25; Romans 3:19). With men of other tongues, etc. The application of this Old Testament quotation furnishes one of the many singular instances of quotation which prove that the Jews often referred to the words without any direct reference to their context or original meaning. He here wishes to show that glossolaly had little or no value except as an evidence to unbelievers, and illustrates this by Isaiah 28:11, 12. Now, in that passage Isaiah tells the drunken priests, who scornfully imitated his style, that, since they derided God's message so delivered to them, God would address them in a very different way by the Assyrians, whose language they did not understand; and that even to this stern lesson, taught them by people of alien tongue, they would remain deaf. In the original, therefore, there is not the least allusion to any phenomenon resembling the \"gift of tongues.\" But the mere words of a scriptural passage always came to Jews with all the force of an argument, independently of their primary meaning; and it was enough for St. Paul's purpose that in Isaiah the allusion is to unintelligible utterance, and to the fact that the teaching which it was meant to convey would be in vain. And other lips. St. Paul does not quote the LXX. The Hebrew has \"with stammerings of lips and another tongue will he speak\" (comp. Deuteronomy 28:49).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Wherefore. In accordance with this illustration. Not to them that believe. Because their belief depends on other and far deeper grounds. Serveth. This word is wrongly supplied; it should be, is for a sign. Not for them that believe not. Because there is nothing necessarily startling in preaching. It might, indeed, produce conviction in the unbelieving (ver. 25), but it was not a special \"sign\" \"The unbelieving\" are those who used to drop in at the Christian services out of curiosity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - All speak with tongues. He does not necessarily mean that all are speaking at once; though, amid these strange scenes of self-asserting enthusiasm, even that was not wholly impossible; but he means, \"if there be nothing, going on except glossolaly.\" Will they not say that ye are mad? This has often been the actual impression produced by these phenomena upon those who stand aloof from the spiritual influences which cause them. On the day of Pentecost the exaltation of the disciples caused mockers to charge them with drunken exhilaration (Acts 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - All prophesy. If one after another speak the word of spiritual exhortation. He is convinced of all, he is judged of all; literally, he is being convicted by all, he is being examined by all; in other words, each address is calculated to awaken conviction in him and to search his heart. Thus the address of St. Peter pierced the consciences of his hearers, when the glossolaly even of Pentecost produced no effect beyond that of irreverent wonder (Acts 2:37). It is easy to see that the style and method of worship in the assemblies of Christians at this early epoch resembled that now prevalent among Quakers. The teaching was not left to recognized pastors, but any Christian might speak who had gifts which moved him to address his brethren. The externals of worship are of no eternal signifiance, but are best left to be moulded by the requirements of time and place, with reference to the teachings of past experience. No doubt St. Paul's depreciation of glossolaly led to its rapid disappearance when it had done its work of being \"a sign to unbelievers.\" But if ancient modes of worship were too independent of rigid conditions, modern modes are, on the other hand, too stereotyped and inelastic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The secrets of his heart. \"The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,.., and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart\" (Hebrews 4:12). Falling down on his face. An Oriental. mode of showing humility and deep conviction (Isaiah 45:14; 1 Samuel 19:24). It does not furnish the shadow of an excuse for the encouragement of catalepsy by the mechanical excitement of revivalism. That God is in you of a truth. St. Paul is probably thinking both of Isaiah 45:14 and Zechariah 8:23, where similar phrases are used.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,NEWLINEAnd fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Goldsmith.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.

Every one of you hath a psalm, etc. We see here a somewhat melancholy picture of the struggling self assertion of rival claimants to attention. A doctrine; rather, a teaching, The glossolaly had probably been promoted by Syrian enthusiasts, perhaps of the Petrine party; the egotism of oratory and itch of teaching now described (James 3:1) may have been developed in the Apollonian party. Unto edifying. The object is moral improvement, not idle self display, not the ostentation of individual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:7, 8, 10). To this he recurs again and again (1 Corinthians 3:9; 1 Corinthians 14:3, 5, 12; 2 Corinthians 5:1; 2 Corinthians 10:8; 2 Corinthians 11:19; 2 Corinthians 13:10; and the verb frequently). The substantive, as used by St. Paul, only occurs again in Romans (Romans 14:19; Romans 15:2), and in Ephesians (Ephesians 2:21, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And that by course; rather, and that in turn. He does not allow more than one glossolalist to speak at a time, and not more than three at the most in any one service. This rule alone tended to extinguish the disorderly exhibition of\" tongues.\" To control the passion which leads to it is, sooner or later, to stop the manifestation - a result which St. Paul would probably have been the last to regret, when its purpose had been accomplished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Let him keep silence. The \"him\" refers to the glossolalist, not to the interpreter. To himself. In his private devotions (as St. Paul himself seems to have done); not in the public assembly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Two or three. If more than two or three preached, the congregation would get weary. Let the other judge; rather, let the rest discriminate the value of what is said. \"Prophesyings\" are not to be despised, but we are only to hold fast what is good (1 Thessalonians 5:20, 21), and we are \"to try the spirits\" (1 John 4:1). St. Paul is not encouraging the Corinthians to the consoriousness of conceited and incompetent criticism, but only putting them on their guard against implicit acceptance of all they hear; which was a very necessary caution at a place where so many teachers sprang up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Let the first hold his peace. It would be easy enough to judge whether the revelation vouchsafed to his neighbour was more pressing and important than his own address.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Ye may all prophesy; rather, ye all can; that is, \"if you have the gift of prophesying.\" St. Paul has already implied that at every assembly there would be idiotai, unendowed worshippers, who only came to profit by the gifts of others, and that \"all\" are not prophets (1 Corinthians 12:29). May be comforted; rather, may be exhorted or cheered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. Into this golden aphorism St. Paul compresses the whole force of his reasoning. The articles are better omitted: \"Spirits of prophets are under the control of prophets.\" Mantic inspirations, the violent possession which threw sibyls and priestesses into contortions - the foaming lip and streaming hair and glazed or glaring eye - have no place in the self-controlling dignity of Christian inspiration. Even Jewish prophets, in the paroxysm of emotion, might lie naked on the ground and rave (1 Samuel 19:24); but the genuine inspiration in Christian ages never obliterates the self consciousness or overpowers the reason; It abhors the hysteria and simulation and frenzy which have sometimes disgraced revivalism and filled lunatic asylums.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Of confusion. The word is rendered \"commotion\" in Luke 21:9; \"tumult,\" in 2 Corinthians 6:5 and 2 Cor 12:20. \"Confusion\" is, as St. James says (James 3:16), the result of envious and pushing egotism. But of peace; which cannot coexist with inflation and restlessness. As in all Churches of the saints. The clause probably belongs to this verse, not to the following. It is a reflection on the exceptional turbulence and disorder which disgraced the Corinthian Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - Rules about the public teaching by women. Verse 34. - Let your women keep silence in the Churches. St. Paul evidently meant this to be a general rule, and one which ought to be normally observed; for he repeats it in 1 Timothy 2:11, 12. At the same time, it is fair to interpret it as a rule made with special reference to time and circumstances, and obviously admitting of exceptions in both dispensations (Judges 4:4; 2 Kings 22:14; Nehemiah 6:14; Luke 2:36; Acts 2:17; Acts 21:9), as is perhaps tacitly implied in 1 Corinthians 11:5. But... to be under obedience (Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 2:18; Titus 2:5; 1 Peter 3:1). Christianity emancipated women, but did not place them on an equality with men.

The formula seems to fall under the idiom which refuses to say anything more about a subject (\"If I perish, I perish;\" \"What I have written, I have written;\" \"He that is filthy, let him be filthy still,\" etc.). The readings vary considerably (\"He is ignored;\" \"He has been ignored;\" \"He shall be ignored;\" \"Let him be ignored\"). These other readings would be a statement of retribution in kind - of God \"sprinkling penal blindnesses on forbidden lusts.\" But the reading of our translation is on the whole the best supported, and means that to invincible bigotry and ignorant obstinacy St. Paul will have no more to say (Matthew 15:14; 1 Timothy 6:3-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Wherefore. The final conclusion. Covet... forbid not. The power to preach is to be desired; all that can be said of glossolaly is that it is not to be absolutely forbidden so long as the conditions which St. Paul has laid down for its regulation are observed. But glossolaly is hardly possible under conditions of order, decorum, and self suppression, and we are not surprised that we hear no more of it in the Church, but only in the wild excitement of fanatical sects. The suppression, however, of the startling manifestation by no means necessarily involves any enfeeblement of the inspiring conviction from which it sprang. The brawling torrent which \"foams its madness off\" is lost in the calm and majestic flow of the deep river.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians14:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet all things be done decently and in order.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Let all things. The \"but\" of the original should not be omitted. It is a final caution against the abuse of the permission accorded in the last clause. Decently; that is, \"with decorum.\" Thus Milton uses the term —NEWLINENEWLINE\"... and heldNEWLINEBefore his decent steps a silver wand.\" In Romans 13:13 and 1 Thessalonians 4:12 it is translated \"honestly,\" i.e. honourably.

This chapter, and the thirteenth, on Christian love, stand out, even among the writings of St. Paul, as pre-eminently beautiful and important. No human words ever written have brought such comfort to millions of mourners as the words of this chapter, which form a part of the Burial Service of almost every Christian community. It is the more deeply imprinted on the memory of men because it comes to us in the most solemn hours of bereavement, when we have most need of a living faith. The chapter falls into six sections.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The evidence of Christ's resurrection (vers. 1-11).NEWLINENEWLINE2.

Conclusion and exhortation (vers. 50-58). Verses 1-11. - The evidence of the resurrection of Christ. Verse 1. - Moreover. The δὲ of the original merely marks the transition to a new topic. The gospel. He here uses the word with special reference to the Resurrection, which is one of the most central and necessary doctrines of the \"good tidings,\" and which always occupied a prominent place in St. Paul's preaching (Acts 17:18; Acts 23:6), as well as in that of all the apostles (Acts 1:22; Acts 4:2; 1 Peter 3:21). Ye have received; rather, ye received. The \"also\" is emphatic. The Corinthians had not been like Christ's \"own,\" who \"received him not\" (John 1:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - By which also ye are saved; literally, ye are being saved. It is as if some surprise was expressed at the necessity for again making known to them a gospel whichNEWLINENEWLINE(1) he had preached andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) they also received; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) in which they now stood fast (Romans 5:2; Ephesians 6:13); andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) by means of which they were now in a state of safety, they were of the class of sozomenoi (Acts 2:47). If ye keep in memory what I preached unto you. The order, which is peculiar, is, \"In what words I preached to you, if ye hold [it] fast.\" Possibly the \"in what discourse\" depends on \"I make known to you.\" The duty of \"holding fast\" what they had heard is often impressed on the early converts (1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Corinthians 6:10; 1 Thessalonians 5:21; Hebrews 10:23). Ye have believed; rather, ye believed; i.e. ye became believers. In vain. The word may either mean \"rashly,\" \"without evidence,\" as in classical Greek; or \"to no purpose,\" \"without effect,\" as in Romans 13:4; Galatians 3:4; Galatians 4:11. In this case they would have received the seed in stony places (Matthew 13:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - First of all; literally, among the first things; but this idiom means \"first of all.\" It does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but is found in Genesis 33:2; 2 Samuel 5:8 (LXX.). This testimony to the Resurrection is very remarkable, because:NEWLINENEWLINE1. It is the completest summary.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It refers to some incidents which are not mentioned in the Gospels.NEWLINENEWLINE3. It declares that the death and resurrection of Christ were a subject of ancient prophecy.NEWLINENEWLINE4. It shows the force of the evidence on which the apostles relied and the number of living eye witnesses to whom they could appeal.NEWLINENEWLINE5. It is the earliest written testimony to the Resurrection; for it was penned within twenty-five years of the event itself.NEWLINENEWLINE6. It shows that the evidence for the Resurrection as a literal, historical, objective fact, was sufficient to convince the powerful intellect of a hostile contemporary observer.NEWLINENEWLINE7. It probably embodies, and became the model for, a part of the earliest Creed of the Church. For our sins; literally, on behalf of. The passage is remarkable as the only one in which \"on behalf of\" is used with \"sins\" in St. Paul. In 1 Corinthians 1:13 we are told that he died\" on behalf of us\" (Romans 5:8; see 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24). The expressions involve the image of Christ as a Sin Offering for the forgiveness of sins. According to the Scriptures. The chief passages alluded to are doubtless Isaiah 53:5, 8; Daniel 9:26; Psalm 22; Zechariah 12:10; together with such types as the offering of Isaac (Genesis 22.) and the Paschal lamb, etc. Our Lord had taught the apostles confidently to refer to the Messianic interpretation of the Old Testament prophecies (Luke 24:25, 46: Acts 8:35; Acts 17:3; Acts 26:22, 23; John 2:22; John 20:9; 1 Peter 1:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And that he rose; rather, that he had been raised. The burial was a single act; the Resurrection is permanent and eternal in its issues. According to the Scriptures (Psalm 16:10; Isaiah 53:10; Hosea 6:2; Jonah 2:10; comp. Matthew 12:40; Matthew 16:4; Acts 2:31; Acts 13:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Was seen of Cephas (Luke 24:34). The appearances to the women (John 20:14, etc.) are omitted, as being evidential rather to the apostles than to the world. The twelve (John 20:19, 26). Some officious scribes have in some manuscripts altered the word into\" the eleven.\" But \"the twelve\" is here the designation of an office, and great ancient writers are always indifferent to mere pragmatic accuracy in trifles which involve nothing. To witness to the Resurrection was a main function of \"the twelve\" (Acts 2:23; Acts 3:15; Acts 10:40, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Above five hundred brethren at once. We cannot be certain whether this memorable appearance took place in Jerusalem or in Galilee. It is, however, most probable that this was the appearance on the mountain (Matthew 28:16, 17; comp. Matthew 26:32). Of whom the greater part remain unto this present. This sentence - a confident contemporary appeal to a very large number of living witnesses, by one who would rather have died than lied - is of the highest evidential value. It shows that the Resurrection was not \"a thing done in a corner \"(Acts 26:26). Fallen asleep. The beautiful and common word for death in the New Testament (Matthew 27:52; John 11:11; Acts 7:60, etc.). Hence the word \"cemetery\" - \"a sleeping place.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Seen of James. The \"James\" intended is undoubtedly the only James then living, who was known to the whole Christian Church, namely, \"the Lord's brother,\" the author of the Epistle, and the Bishop of Jerusalem (Galatians 2:9; Acts 15:13; Acts 21:18). James the son of Zebedee had by this time been martyred, and James the son of Alphaeus was never much more than a name to the Church in general. There is no mention of this appearance in the Gospel; but in the Gospel of the Hebrews was a curious legend (preserved in St. Jerome, 'De Virr. Illust.,' 2.) that James had made a vow that he would neither eat nor drink till he had seen Jesus risen from the dead, and that Jesus, appearing to him, said, \"My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is risen from the dead.\" The truth of the appearance is strongly supported by the fact that James, like the rest of the Lord's \"brothers,\" \"did not believe\" in Christ before the Crucifixion, whereas after the Resurrection we find him and the rest of \"the Lord's brothers\" ardently convinced (John 12:3-5; Acts 1:14; Acts 9:5, etc.). Of all the apostles (Acts 1:3; Luke 24:50). James the Lord's brother was only an apostle in the wider sense of the word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He was seen of me also. The reference undoubtedly is to the vision on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:5; Acts 22:14; Acts 26:16). As of one born out of due time; literally, as to the abortive born. The word means \"the untimely fruit of a woman,\" a child born out of the due time or natural course; and hence \"diminutive\" and \"weakly.\" The Greek ektroma is represented by the Latin abortivus. St. Paul, when he remembered the lateness of his conversion, and his past persecution of the saints, regards himself as standing in this relation to the twelve.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For. This and the next verse are an explanation of the strong and strange term which he had applied to himself. The least of the apostles. In St. Paul there was a true and most deep humility, but no mock modesty. He knew the special gifts which he had received from God. He was well aware that to him had been entrusted the ten talents rather than the one talent. He could appeal to far vaster results than had been achieved by the work of any other apostle. He knew his own importance as \"a chosen vessel,\" a special instrument in God's hands to work out exceptional results. But in himself he always felt, and did not shrink from confessing, that he was \"nothing\" (2 Corinthians 12:11). The notion that he here alludes to the meaning of his own name (Paulus, connected with παῦρος, φαῦρος, equivalent to \"little\") is very unlikely. In Ephesians 3:8 he goes further, and calls himself \"less than the least of all saints,\" though even there he claims to have been the special apostle of the Gentiles. Because I persecuted the Church of God. This was the one sin for which, though he knew that God had forgiven him (1 Timothy 1:13), yet he could never quite forgive himself (Galatians 1:13). In my 'Life of St. Paul' I have shown from the language used, that this persecution was probably more deadly than has been usually supposed, involving not only torture, but actual bloodshed (Acts 8:4; Acts 9:1), besides the martyrdom of St. Stephen. We can imagine how such deeds and such scenes would, even after forgiveness, lie like sparks of fire in a sensitive conscience.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Saints, did I say? with your remembered faces;NEWLINEDear men and women whom I sought and slew?NEWLINEOh, when I meet you in the heavenly places,NEWLINEHow will I weep to Stephen and to you!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - By the grace of God I am. what I am. And therefore he was \"in nothing behind the very chiefest apostles.\" However humbly he thought of himself, it would have been mere unfaithfulness to disparage his own work (2 Corinthians 3:5, 6). I laboured more abundantly than they all. Because God wrought effectually in him (Galatians 2:8). The word used for \"labour\" implies the extreme of toil (Matthew 6:28: Philippians 2:16), etc. But the grace of God. \"It is God that worketh in you\" (Philippians 2:13; Matthew 10:20; Colossians 1:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Whether it were I or they; namely, who preached this gospel to you. It is not his immediate object to maintain his independent apostolic claims, but only to appeal to the fact of the Resurrection which was preached by all the apostles alike. So. In accordance with the testimony just given (vers. 4-8). We preach. There are in the New Testament two words for \"preaching.\" One is often rendered \"prophesy,\" and refers to spiritual instruction and exhortation. The other, which is used here, is \"we proclaim,\" or \"herald\" (kerusso), and refers to the statement of the facts of the gospel - Christ crucified and risen (1 Corinthians 2:2; Acts 4:2; Acts 8:5). Besides these, there is the one word for \"to preach the gospel,\" or \"evangelize.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-19. - The resurrection of Christ is the basis of our faith in the general resurrection. Verse 12. - Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead. St. Paul sees that if One has risen from the dead, the fact of that miracle, taken in connection with the rest of the gospel, furnishes Christians with a sufficient proof that they shall rise. \"For,\" he had already said to the Thessalonians, \"if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him\" (see the same argument in Romans 8:11). That there is no resurrection of the dead. These deniers of the resurrection are usually called \"the Corinthian Sadducees.\" After the state of social and moral laxity of which we have been reading, we can scarcely be surprised at the existence of any disorder or anomaly in the Church of Corinth. Yet it comes with something of a shock on our paralyzed sense of astonishment to read that some of these Christians actually denied a resurrection! The fact at once proves two remarkable truths, namely,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the early Christian Church had none of the ideal purity of doctrine which is sometimes ecclesiastically attributed to it; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that there was in the bosom of that Church a wide and most forbearing tolerance. We have no data to enable us to determine what were the influences which led to the denial of the resurrection.NEWLINENEWLINE1. They can hardly have been Jewish. The mass of Jews at this time shared the views of the Pharisees, who strongly maintained the resurrection (Acts 23:6). If they were Jews at all, they could only have been Sadducees or Essenes. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the Sadducees were a small, wealthy, and mainly political sect, who had no religious influence, and can certainly have had no representatives at Corinth; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the Essenes, though they had considerable influence in Asia, do not seem to have established themselves in Greece, nor are we aware that they were hostile to the doctrine of the resurrection.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Probably, then, they were Gentiles. If so, they may have beenNEWLINENEWLINE(1) either Epicureans, who disbelieved in a future life altogether; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) Stoics, who held that the future life was only an impersonal absorption into the Divine. Both these schools of philosophers \"jeered\" at the very notion of a bodily resurrection (Acts 17:32). In 2 Timothy 2:18 we read of some, like Hymenaeus and Philetus, who erred, saying \"that the resurrection was past already.\" These teachers were incipient Gnostics, who spiritualized the resurrection, or rather said that the term was only applicable to the rising from the death of sin to the life of righteousness. The Corinthian doubters seem from the arguments which St. Paul addresses to them, to have been rather troubled with material doubts which they may have inherited from their Gentile training.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Then is Christ not risen. If the possibility of a resurrection be generically denied, it cannot in any instance be true. Yet you admit as Christians that Christ rose! and his resurrection \"has begotten us again to a lively hope\" (1 Peter 1:3; see 2 Corinthians 4:14; 1 Thessalonians 4:14; John 14:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Vain. You accepted our proclamation (kerugma), yet it would be utterly void if its central testimony was false. The word translated \"then\" has a sort of ironic force - \"after all,\" or \"it seems.\" The whole argument is at once an argumentum ad hominem and a reductio ad absurdum. Your faith is also vain. For it would be faith in a crucified man, not in the risen Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - We are found. The word means, \"we are proved to be,\" convicted of being false witnesses. False witnesses of God; i.e. concerning God. St. Paul does not shrink from the issue. It is not one - it could not be one - between truth and mistake, but between truth and falsehood. We have testified of God that he raised up Christ; rather, the Christ. \"This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses\" (Acts 2:32; Acts 4:33; Acts 13:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - This verse is a repetition of Ver. 13, to emphasize the argument that the Christian faith in the Resurrection rests not on philosophic theory, but on an historic fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Vain; rather, frustrate. The word used (mataia) is different from the word used (kene) in ver 14. Ye are yet in your sins. Because a dead Redeemer could be no Redeemer. Christ's resurrection is the pledge of his Divine power. He was \"raised for our justification\" (Romans 4:25). It is only \"as a Prince and Saviour\" that \"God hath exalted him to give repentance and forgiveness of sins\" (Acts 5:31; Romans 5:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Which are fallen asleep in Christ. Christians whose bodies have sunk into the sleep of death. Are perished. A notion which he feels that Christians must reject as utterly impossible. All that goodness, faith, tenderness, love, have not been dissolved to nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If in this life only we have hope in Christ. The word to which \"in Christ\" should be joined is uncertain; the order st the original is, \"If in this life in Christ we have hoped only.\" The \"only\" seems therefore to qualify the whole sentence: \"If we have merely hoped in Christ, and that only in this life.\" We are of all men most miserable; literally, we are more pitiable than all men. The remark only has an absolute bearing when Christians really are suffering from persecutions, as they did in St. Paul's day (2 Corinthians 1:5; 2 Timothy 3:12). But to some extent all Christians have to bear their cross, and if all that they give up and suffer is sacrificed to a delusion, they deserve most pity in one sense, because they have been most conspicuously befooled. In another sense they are still the happiest of men; for their delusion, judged by its fruits, is more blessed than the dreary blank which is the only alternative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-28. - Results to be deduced from the fact of Christ's resurrection. Verse 20. - But now. Since the supposition that Christ has not risen involves so many suppositions which you will rightly reject as absurd, we may assume the eternal fact that Christ has been raised. And become the firstfruits of them that slept. As the wave sheaf (Leviticus 23:10), which was the firstfruits of the harvest, is also a pledge of the harvest, so Christ is the firstfruits and pledge of the resurrection of all mankind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - By man came death (see Romans 5:12, 17; Romans 6:21, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - As in Adam all die. All of us partake of Adam's nature, and are therefore liable to the death which that nature incurred as the law and condition of its humanity. In Christ shall all be made alive. It is St. Paul's invariable habit to isolate his immediate subject; to think and to treat of one topic at a time. He is not here thinking directly and immediately of the resurrection in general. In this verse, writing to Christians who are \"in Christ,\" he is only thinking and speaking of the resurrection of those who are \"in Christ.\" That any can be nominally \"in Christ,\" yet not really so, is a fact which is not at present under his cognizance; still less is he thinking of the world in general. In other words, he is here dealing with \"the resurrection of life\" alone, and not also with the \"resurrection of judgment\" (John 5:26-29). Still, as far as his words alone are concerned, it is so impossible to understand the phrase, \"shall all be made alive,\" of a resurrection to endless torments, that his language at least suggests the conclusion that \"the principle which has come to actuality in Christ is of sufficient energy to quicken all men for the resurrection to the blessed life\" (Baur, 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:219).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - In his own order. The word in classic Greek means \"a cohort.\" Here it must either mean \"rank\" or be used as in St. Clement ('Ad. Corinthians,' 1:37), in the sense of \"order of succession.\" They that are Christ's. \"The dead in Christ\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16). At his coming. The word here used for the second Advent is Parousia, which means literally, presence. It is implied (apparently) both here and in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; Revelation 20:5, that there shall be an interval - how long or how short we do not know - between this resurrection of the just and the final resurrection. But all the details are left dim and vague.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The end. That \"end of all things,\" beyond which the vision of Christian eschatology does not look. When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God. The \"kingdom\" delivered up is not that of the coequal Godhead, but the mediatorial kingdom. The Divine kingdom \"shall have no end\" (Luke 1:33, etc.), and \"shall not pass away\" (Daniel 7:13). But the mediatorial kingdom shall end in completion when the redemptive act has achieved its final end. When he shall have put down; rather, shall have annulled or abolished. All rule. Because then \"the kingdoms of the world\" shall all \"have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ\" (Revelation 11:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - He must reign. He must reign in his mediatorial kingdom as the God Man. He hath put. The \"he\" probably means Christ himself (comp. Psalm 2:9; Hebrews 10:13), though it makes no real difference in the sense if we understand it of God, as in Psalm 110:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. This rendering might imply that other enemies should still exist, though Death should be the last who would be destroyed. The original is more forcible, and implies, \"Last of enemies doomed to annulment is Death;\" or, as in Tyndale's version, \"Lastly, Death the enemy shall be destroyed;\" or, as in the Rhemish Version, \"And at the last, Death the enemy scal be distried.\" The present, \"is being annulled,\" is the praesens futurascens, or the present of which the accomplishment is regarded as already begun and continuing by an inevitable law. Death and Hades and the devil, \"who hath the power of death,\" are all doomed to abolition (2 Timothy 1:10; Hebrews 2:14; Revelation 20:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - But when he saith. The \"he\" refers to God. This indirect method of quotation is common in the rabbis. The reference is to Psalm 8:7 (LXX.), and the words, spoken of man in general, are here Messianically transferred to the federal Head of humanity, the ideal and perfect God Man, Jesus Christ. (For the fuller explanation of the matter, see Hebrews 2:5-10.) He is excepted, which did put all things under him. So our Lord says, \"All things are delivered unto me of my Father\" (Matthew 11:7). The universal dominion of Christ is also insisted on in Ephesians 1:20-22; 1 Peter 3:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Then shall the Son also himself be subject, etc. The words can only be taken as they stand. The attempts to explain them have usually been nothing but ingenious methods of explaining them away. Of these the one usually adopted by the Fathers is the limitation of the statement to Christ's human nature (John 5:26, 27, 30) and mediatorial kingdom, just as we find in 1 Corinthians 11:3. The head of Christ is God.\" We can easily \"darken counsel by words without knowledge\" in dealing with this subject, and hide an absolute ignorance under a semblance of knowledge; but anything and everything which we can say in \"explanation\" of this self subjection of the Son to the Father is simply involved in the words which follow. That God may be all in all. \"All things in all things\" or \"all things in all men.\" The words involve a complete and absolute supremacy. It is quite an easy matter for commentators to say that the scope of the words \"must be confined to believers,\" if they chose to make \"all\" mean \"some.\" Such methods often lead to an irreligious religionism and a heterodox orthodoxy. The reader will find the same phrase in Colossians 3:11. I confine myself to the comment of the profound and saintly Bengel: \"There is implied something new, but also supreme and eternal. All things, and therefore all men, without any interruption, no created thing claiming a place, no enemy creating opposition, shall be subordinated to the Son, the Son to the Father. All things shall say, 'God is all things to me.' This is the consummation; this the end and summit. Further than this not even an apostle can go.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElse what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-34. - Arguments from the practices and lives of Christians. The three arguments used in these verses are: If there be no resurrection:NEWLINENEWLINE1. Why do some of you get yourselves baptized on behalf of your dead friends?NEWLINENEWLINE2. Why do we face lives of daily peril?NEWLINENEWLINE3. How would it be otherwise possible to resist Epicurean views of life? Verse 29. - Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, etc.? This clause can have but one meaning, and that its obvious one, namely, that, among the many strange opinions and practices which then prevailed, was one which was entirely un-warranted-but which St. Paul does not here stop to examine - of persons getting themselves baptized as it were by proxy for others who had died. Doubtless some of the deaths alluded to in 1 Corinthians 11:30 had happened to persons who had been cut off before they were actually baptized; and their friends had as it were gone through the rite in their stead, in the hope of extending to them some of its benefits. It is argued that St. Paul could not possibly mention such a practice without reprobation; but that is an a priori assumption not warranted by St. Paul's methods (see 1 Corinthians 10:8; 1 Corinthians 11:6). He always confines his attention to the question immediately before him, and his present object is merely to urge a passing argumentum ad hominem. There is nothing at all surprising in the existence of such an abuse in the medley of wild opinions and wild practices observable in this disorganized Church. It accords with the known tendency of later times to postpone baptism, as a rite which was supposed to work as a charm. We also find that the actual practice of baptism on behalf of the dead lingered on among Corinthians (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 28:7) and Marcionites (Tertullian, 'De Resurrect.,' 48; 'Adv. Marc.,' 5:10). Tertullian accepts the words in their obvious sense in his 'De Praeser. Haer.,' 48, but accepts the absurdity of \"the dead\" meaning \"the body\" (\"pro mortuis tingui est pro corporibus tingui\") in his book against Marcion (5:10). St. Chrysostom tells us further that the proxy who was to be baptized used to be concealed under the bier of the dead man, who was supposed to answer in his name that he desired to be baptized. How perfectly natural the custom was may be seen from the fact that among the Jews also a man dying under ceremonial pollution was cleansed by proxy. The \"interpretations\" of this verse are so numerous that it is not even possible to give a catalogue of them. Many of them are not worth recording, and are only worth alluding to at all as specimens of the wilful bias which goes to Scripture, not to seek truth, but to support tradition. They are mostly futile and fantastic, because they pervert the plain meaning of the plain words. It is a waste of time and space to give perpetuity to baseless fancies. Such are the notions that \"for the dead\" can mean \"for our mortal bodies\" (Chrysostom); or \"for those about to die\" (Estius, Calvin, etc.); or \"over (the sepulchres of) the dead\" (Luther); or \"to supply the vacancies left by the dead\" (Le Clerc, etc.). Equally unwarrantable are the \"explanations\" (?) which make those who are being \"baptized\" mean those who are \"passing through a baptism of suffering\" (!). Not a single argument which is worth a moment's consideration can be urged in favour of any one of these, or scores of similar views. If we are to get rid of everything that is surprising on the ground that it is \"immensely improbable,\" we may as well discard Scripture at once, and reconstruct early Christian history out of our own consciousness. It has been very usual to represent it as we think that it ought to have been, and not as it was. The disuse of this vicarious baptism among orthodox Christians may have been due to the discouragement of it by St. Paul when he went to Corinth, and \"set in order\" various erroneous customs (1 Corinthians 11:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd why stand we in jeopardy every hour?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Why stand we in jeopardy every hour? The verb means \"Why do we incur peril?\" The best comment on it will be found in 2 Corinthians 11:26. Cicero says ('Tusc. Disp.,' 1:15) that \"no one would be so mad as to live in labour and perils if our instinctive anticipation of future life were taken away.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - I protest. The particle of adjuration here used (νὴ) is found nowhere else in the New Testament. By your rejoicing. This is an erroneous translation. The words mean \"by my glorying in you.\" St. Paul's one subject of earthly glory, his \"hope, and joy, and crown of rejoicing,\" was the conversion of Churches (Romans 15:16, 17). In Christ Jesus our Lord. His boasting was not a worldly boasting, but was sanctifled by its reference to the work of Christ. I die daily. St. Paul \"died daily\" a double death - the ever deepening death unto sin and unto the world; and the daily death of sufferings borne for Christ's sake (see 2 Corinthians 4:10, 11). It is the latter to which he here alludes. \"For thy sake are we killed all the day long\" (Romans 8:36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - After the manner of men. The phrase is a qualification of the strong metaphor, \"I fought with beasts.\" It is equivalent to \"humanly speaking.\" This is Chrysostom's view. It is the most reasonable, and accords with the use of the phrase in Romans 3:5; Galatians 3:15. Meyer, however, explains it to mean \"with mere human motives.\" I have fought with beasts. Not literally, for in that case he would have mentioned it in 2 Corinthians 11. as one of his deadliest perils, and it must have been recorded by St. Luke in his full account of St. Paul's life at Ephesus. A Roman citizen was legally exempt from this mode of punishment. The word points to some special peril incurred in resisting the hostility of the worshippers of Artemis (Acts 20:19), but not to the tumult in the theatre, which did not happen till after this letter was despatched (1 Corinthians 16:8, 9). The metaphor is not uncommon. Thus in 2 Timothy 4:17 St. Paul alludes to Nero (probably) as \"the lion.\" David often compares his enemies to wild beasts (Psalm 22:21, etc.). When his jailor informed Agrippa of the death of Tiberius, he did so in the words, \"The lion is dead.\" St. Ignatius writes of the ten soldiers who were conducting him to Rome as \"ten leopards.\" Epimenides, in the line quoted by St. Paul in Titus 1:12, spoke of the Cretans as \"evil wild beasts,\" and the pseudo-Heraclitus gives this same uncomplimentary title to these very Ephesians. Let as eat and drink; for tomorrow we die. Perhaps the \"if the dead are not raised\" belongs to this clause. He means that such an Epicurean maxim, if never excusable, would at least be natural, if men could only look to life in the present. The sentiment is found on the lips of the despairing and the sensual alike in Isaiah 22:13, and in the writings of the heathen (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:4, 13-17, etc.). St. Paul would be all the more familiar with it because it formed the infamous epitaph of a statue of Sardauapalus, which he must have often seen in his boyhood at Anchiale, near Tarsus. It represented the debased king as snapping his fingers, and using almost these very words. It is strange that similar passages should be found even in the Talmud. Shemuel said to Rav Yehudah, \"Seize and eat, seize and drink; for the world is like a wedding feast (soon over)\" ('Eiruvin,' fol. 54, 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Be net deceived. Do not be led astray by such specious maxims. They can only arise from that too great familiarity with the heathen against which I have already put you on your guard. Evil communications corrupt good manners. An iambic line from the 'Thais' of Menander, and perhaps taken by Menander from a play of Euripides. More accurately it means \"evil associations corrupt excellent morals.\" According to the best reading (χρηστὰ, not χρησθ), St. Paul does not quote it as an iambic, and in itself it does not offer the least shadow of proof that St. Paul was familiar with classic literature. It is just such a line as he might have seen carved on the Hermae of any Greek town, or preserved in any chrestomathy or gnomology which may have chanced to pass through his hands. His other classic quotations (from Epimenides, Titus 1:12; and Aratus or Cleanthes, Acts 17:28) are of the same common and proverbial character. It is very unlikely that he would have deliberately quoted from the immoral play of a corrupt comedian like Menander. (For the sentiment, see 2 Timothy 2:16-18.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAwake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Awake to righteousness. The word rendered \"awake\" means \"awake at once from a drunken sleep.\" This verb does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The word rendered \"awake\" in Ephesians 5:14 and Romans 13:11 is a different one. The metaphor, however, occurs in the simple verb in 1 Thessalonians 5:6, 8; 2 Timothy 4:5; 1 Peter 5:8, etc. The word rendered \"to righteousness\" is literally an adverb, righteously. It may mean \"as is fit.\" And sin not. Here the present tense, \"be not sinning,\" is contrasted with the instantaneous aorist, \"awake.\" Have not the knowledge. The original is stronger, \"have an ignorance.\" They have not a vacuum of nescience, but a plenuum of ignorance. I speak this to your shame; rather, I am speaking to shame you. The object of all I am saying is to excite your shame - not, as in some previous instances, \"to spare you.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-49. - Material objections answered. Verse 35. - But some man will say. The objection is that of some philosophical materialist. The resurrection of the body was a difficulty alike to Sadducees and Gentiles. St. Paul meets this difficulty by natural analogies, which are intended to show that the resurrection body, though identical with the mortal body so far as the preservation of personal identity is concerned, is yet a glorified body, so that the objections urged on the ground that it is impossible to preserve the same material particles which have passed into dust, are beside the mark. St. Paul gives no sanction to the coarse physical conceptions of the resurrection which described the human being as rising (to use the words of the Christian poet Prudentius) \"with every tooth and every nail.\" How are the dead raised up? This question is one which, of course, admits of no answer. And with what body do they come? literally, with what kind of body? St. Paul, while he only answers the question indirectly and by analogy, implies that the resurrection body is the same body, not so much by way of material identity as of glorified individuality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Thou fool. The expression is too strong, and it is unfortunate that in English it seems to run contrary to the distinct censure of such language by our Lord. But here the Greek word is aphron, \"O unreasonable!\" (the nominative is used for the vocative); Vulgate, insipiens; Wickliffe, \"unwise man.\" It is merely a reproach for neglecting to exercise the understanding. The word \"fool!\" (more) forbidden by our Lord (Matthew 5:22) has quite a different meaning, and implies quite a different tone. It involves moral depravity or obstinacy (Matthew 7:26; Matthew 23:17, etc.). The milder aphron is used in 2 Corinthians 11:16, 19; 2 Corinthians 12:11; Ephesians 5:17; and by our Lord himself. That which thou sowest. The \"thou\" is emphatic. It merely means \"Even the analogy of human sowing ought to remove thy difficulty.\" The growth of the seed shows that there may be personal identity under a complete change of material conditions. Is not quickened, except it die. The metaphor is used by our Lord (John 12:24, \"Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit\"). It is also found in the Talmud.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Not that body that shall be. This deep remark should have checked the idly and offensively materialistic form in which the doctrine of the resurrection is often taught. But bare grain. Wickliffe, \"a naked corne.\" In this passage, almost alone in all his Epistles, St. Paul, who does not seem to have been at all a close observer of external phenomena, uses metaphors drawn from natural life. His usual metaphors are chiefly architectural and agonistic - derived, that is, from buildings and games. That he was not a student of nature arose, no doubt, partly kern his Semitic cast of mind, but chiefly from his being short sighted, and from his having spent most of his early life in large cities. It may chance; if it so happen, (see note on 1 Corinthians 14:10). The English word \"chance\" occurs but four times in the whole Bible (1 Samuel 6:9; Ecclesiastes 9:11). In Luke 10:31 the words rendered \"by chance\" mean rather \"by coincidence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - But God giveth it a body. The material body of each living organism results from those laws of assimilation which God has made a part of His secret of life. They are not the life, only the instrument and expression and manifestation of the life. The \"life\" is the individual identity. The life of Hamlet is not in its essence the physical life of \"the machine which is to him Hamlet,\" but the spiritual life which is linked on earth to that perpetual flux of material particles which we call the body, but is independent of those particles. As it hath pleased him; literally, as he willed. And in the word \"as\" lies the scope for all theories about the part played by what are called \"natural laws.\" Their action is a part of God's will. To every seed his own body. Each of the seeds sown is provided with a body of its own, which is not identical with the seed, but results from the germ of life in the seed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - All flesh is not the same flesh. In other words, animal organisms differ from each other, just as do the vegetable. Another... of beasts. \"The germinal power of the plant transmutes the fixed air and the elementary base of water into grass or leaves, and on these the organic principle in the ox or the elephant exercises an alchemy still more stupendous. As the unseen agency weaves its magic eddies, the foliage becomes indifferently the bone and its marrow, the pulpy brain and the solid ivory. That which you see is blood, is flesh, is itself the work, or shall I say the translucence of the invisible energy which soon surrenders or abandons them to inferior powers (for there is no pause nor chasm in the activities of nature) which repeat a similar metamorphosis according to their kind: these are not fancies, conjectures, or even hypotheses, but facts\" (Coleridge, 'Aids to Reflection ').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial. The words are often misunderstood. The \"celestial bodies\" are not the sun, moon, and stars of the next verse - for that would be a false antithesis to \"bodies terrestrial\" - but bodies (or organisms) which belong to heavenly beings, such as the resurrection body of our Lord and of glorified saints, or even in some sense of angels (Matthew 22:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - There is one glory of the sun. \"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun\" (Matthew 13:43). The point of the illustration is the difference between the earthly and the resurrection body; not the supposed differences between the saints themselves in glory. This is not a question under consideration, and St. Paul, as we have seen, is not in the habit of mixing up half a dozen different questions in the same immediate argument. St. Augustine says of the saints, \"Their splendour is unequal; their heaven is one.\" This may be very true, but to deduce it from this verse is to press into the argument an illustration used for another purpose. Tertullian's comment is very unhappy. He makes \"men\" mean servants of God; \"beasts,\" Gentiles; \"birds,\" martyrs; \"fishes,\" those who have been baptized; the \"sun,\" Christ; the \"moon,\" the Church, etc. One star differeth from another star in glory. All the righteous shall shine as \"the brightness of the firmament and ... as the stars forever and ever\" (Daniel 12:3), and their future bodies shall differ from their present, as one star differs from another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - So also is the resurrection of the dead. In like manner the dead, when raised, shall have bodies which differ from their body of humiliation (Philippians 3:21). It is sown in corruption. \"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return\" (Genesis 3:19). It is raised in incorruption. The word means strictly, \"incorruptibility.\" The resurrection body will not be subjected to earthly conditions (Luke 20:35, 36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - It is sown in dishonour. \"The awful and intolerable indignity of dust to dust.\" In glory. \"Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove, that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold\" (Psalm 68:13). The expression shows that, throughout, St. Paul is thinking exclusively of the resurrection of the saints.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - A natural body. The adjective is the word ψυχικόν, which is so difficult to translate; it means a body only animated by the psyche, or natural life. The word is sometimes in our Authorized Version rendered \"carnal.\" A spiritual body. The apparent contradiction in terms is inevitable. The thing meant is a body which is not under the sway of corporeal desires or of intellectual and passionate impulses, but is wholly dominated by the Spirit, and therefore has no desire or capacity to fulfil the lusts of the flesh. There is. The better supported reading (א, A, B, C, D, F, G), is, if there is a natural body, etc. The existence of the one is no more impossible than the existence of the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The first man Adam was made a living soul (Genesis 2:7). The last Adam. A rabbinic expression also for the Messiah. A quickening Spirit. \"The Son quickeneth whom he will\" (John 5:21; comp. 6:23). The best comment on the expression will be found in Romans 8:2, 11. Christ is \"a quickening,\" i.e. a life giving, \"Spirit,\" here mainly in the sense that we shall only be raised by \"the power of his resurrection\" (John 5:24, 25), but also in the sense that his Spirit dwelleth in us, and is our true Life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - That was not first which is spiritual. The imperfect precedes the perfect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - Earthy. Made of\" the dust of the ground\" (Genesis 2:7). Is the Lord from heaven. The words \"the Lord\" are a gloss, not found in א, B, C, D, E, F, G. The verse remarkably resembles John 3:31, and probably oral reminiscences of our Lord's discourses were current among the apostles long before the Gospels were written. Tertullian attributes the insertion of \"the Lord\" to Marcion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - As is the earthy, etc. Men resemble their first parent Adam; Christians, their spiritual Redeemer, Christ (Philippians 3:20, 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - We shall also bear the image of the heavenly (for the fact, see Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:2). For \"we shall bear,\" the best manuscripts (א, A, C, D, E, F, G, etc.) read \"Let us bear.\" Our reading is, however, supported by B, and this is just one of the cases in which manuscript evidence (or as it is called \"diplomatic evidence\") has a minimum value, and other evidence (paradiplomatic) is decisive. ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the pronunciation of the indicative and subjunctive at that time was almost identical, because in conversation the vowels seem to have been much slurred; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) there was a universal tendency to substitute hortative for direct forms, with a view to edification (as in 1 Corinthians 14:15; Romans 6:2, 8; 2 Corinthians 5:11, etc.). Here the exhortation would ruin the texture of the argument.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 50-58. - Conclusion and exhortation. Verse 50. - Now this I say. This sums up my meaning. Flesh and blood. Our mortal nature and human organism; our \"earthly house of this tabernacle\" (2 Corinthians 5:1; Luke 20:35). Inherit incorruption. A body liable to corruption, with all its loathly accompaniments, cannot enter into the \"inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away\" (1 Peter 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - I show you a mystery. I make known to you a truth now made known to me by revelation. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. There is a great diversity of readings in this verse, noticed even by St. Jerome and St. Augustine. St. Jerome says that all the Latin manuscripts had \"we shall all rise,\" and that the Greek manuscripts wavered between \"we shall all sleep\" and \"we shall not all sleep.\" Some Greek manuscripts had \"we shall all rise, but we shall not all be changed.\" This reading cannot be right, for it contradicts the next verse. There is little doubt that the reading of the Authorized version is right. It accounts for all the variations. They arose from a desire to shelter St. Paul from an apparent mistake, since he and his readers did all sleep. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) St. Paul may have written under that conception of the imminence of Christ's personal return which he expresses in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, where he evidently imagines that the majority of those to whom he was writing would be of those who would be \"alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord;\" orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) even if he no longer entertained that expectation, the \"we\" may naturally apply to the continuity of the Christian Church. For in 2 Corinthians 4:14 he uses \"us\" of those who shall die and be raised. The universal expectation of the immediate return of Christ in the first century roseNEWLINENEWLINE(1) from their non apprehension of the truth that the close of the old dispensation was the \"coming\" to which our Lord had primarily referred in his great eschatological discourse (Matthew 24:34), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) from the fact that watchfulness was intended to be the attitude of the Church, and the day and hour of Christ's coming were kept absolutely unrevealed (Matthew 24:36; Matthew 25:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - The trumpet shall sound. The Lord, he says, in 1 Thessalonians 4:16, \"shall descend from heaven with... the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.\" The trumpet is, of course, only a natural symbol. It is also found in rabbinic writers, and in the Old Testament (Zechariah 9:14), as well as in Revelation 11:15. We shall be changed. The dead shall be changed by resurrection, the living by transition, into a glorified body. St. Paul, dealing with the essence of the question as it bore on the difficulties of his readers, says nothing hereNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of those who will arise to judgment, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) of any intermediate condition.NEWLINENEWLINEAs to the former question, he scarcely ever alludes to it with any definiteness, but seems with deliberate choice to contemplate the final and absolute triumph of good (Romans 8:19-23; Romans 11:30-36). To the intermediate state he does not here allude. He is here only speaking of death and glorious resurrection. In 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 he says all that he has to say on this latter question. It was not prominent in the minds of the early Christians, who, as Calvin says, were awaiting the return of Christ \"from hour to hour.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - This mortal must put on immortality. When we are \"clothed upon\" by our \"house from heaven,\" and have put off \"this tabernacle,\" in which we groan being burdened, then \"mortality will be swallowed up of life\" (2 Corinthians 5:3, 4, where we also find the metaphor of a robe of immortality, mixed up with the metaphor of a building).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - Death is swallowed up in victory. A free citation from the Hebrew of Isaiah 25:8. The words \"into victory\" are the LXX. rendering in other passages (Amos 1:11; Amos 8:8) for the Hebrew lanetsach, forever. The metaphor, \"is swallowed up,\" implying \"the swallowing of the all swallower,\" is found in the rabbis (comp. Hebrews 2:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - O death, where is thy sting? A triumphantly fervid exclamation of the apostle, loosely cited from Hosea 13:14. The apostles and evangelists, not holding the slavish and superstitious fetish worship of the dead letter, often regard it as sufficient to give the general sense of the passages to which they refer. O grave, where is thy victory? In the best attested reading (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), \"death\" is repeated, and in the best manuscripts this clause precedes the last. But if the reading, \"O Hades,\" were correct, our translators, since they held it here impossible in accordance with their views to render it by \"hell,\" ought to have taken warning, and seen the pernicious inapplicability of that rendering in other places where they have used it to express this same Greek word. Here \"Hades\" has probably been introduced into the Greek text from the LXX., which uses it for the Sheol of the original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - The sting of death is sin. Because death is the wages of sin (Romans 6:23). Death is represented as a venomous serpent. The strength of sin is the Law. The best comment on this expression is to be found in the Epistle to the Romans; see especially Romans 4:15; Romans 7:10-12. It must be admitted that this passing allusion to a distinct doctrine does not seem, at first sight, to harmonize with the glorious unity of the subject. No one can read it without a slight sense of jar, because it seems to introduce the element of dogmatic controversy. But this sense of incongruity is removed when we remember how intensely St. Paul felt that man is confronted with the horror of a broken Law, which at once reminds him of a Being infinitely holy, and of his own self condemnation (Romans 7; 2 Corinthians 3.). It is the sense that the Law in its deathful aspect is annulled, and the sinful soul delivered, which prompts the outburst of the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory. The victory consists in the defeat of death by the Resurrection, and the forgiveness of sin through Christ's atone-merit, and the nailing to his cross of the torn and abrogated Law which made us slaves to sin and death (Colossians 2:14). \"In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us\" (Romans 8:37). Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Who, by fulfilling the Law, has robbed it of its condemning power (Romans 8:1), and by his death \"hath destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil\" (Hebrews 2:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians15:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - Therefore. Seeing that you ought not to despair, but to share in this confidence of triumph. Steadfast. Firmly fixed in your own conviction (Colossians 1:23 2John 9). Unmoveable. By others (Ephesians 4:14). Abounding in the work of the Lord. Doing diligently and ungrudgingly the work of your lives, which is his work. That your labour is not in vain. The thought of the verse is the same as that of Galatians 6:9, \"And let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" Some general facts are very observable in this glorious chapter. 1. One is that St. Paul does not meet doubt by angry denunciation, or by crushing it with the iron mace of impatient authority. What would now be thought of Christians who denied the resurrection? Doubtless they were net mere speculative deniers of the resurrection, like Hymenaeus and Philetus (2 Timothy 2:17), but recent Gentile converts, who could not get over their pagan difficulties. Yet St. Paul meets them by personal appeals, by helpful analogies, by lofty reasoning, by the glowing force of inspiring convictions. Instead of taking refuge - more ecclesiastico - in anathema and excommunication, he meets error by the counter presentation of ennobling truth. 2. Another noteworthy fact is that St. Paul's hope of the resurrection rests, like all his theology, on the thought that the life of the Christian is a life \"in Christ.\" 3. A third is his superiority to false analogies - like those of the butterfly and the phoenix - which sufficed many ancient reasoners. Even Christian writers like St. Clement of Rome continued to appeal to the phoenix as a proof of the resurrection. The greatest ancient thinkers - like Tacitus - believed in the existence of that fabulous bird, and even in the genuineness of a specimen of it which had been exhibited at Rome. Was there no \"grace of superintendency\" at work which prevented the sacred writers from adopting the universal error of their day? Had St. Paul appealed to the phoenix, centuries of Christian writers would have continued to maintain the existence of that creature; and science, laughing the belief to scorn, would (most unjustly) have made any allusion to it a proof of mental weakness, and of the falsity of the doctrine which it was supposed to prove. 4. A fourth point to be observed is the wisdom with which St. Paul holds himself aloof from speculative fancies, he does not, like Plato, appeal to the doctrine of \"reminiscence\" (anamnesis), or of unfulfilled ideas. He does not, like Kant, build any argument on man's failure to obey \"the categorical imperative\" of duty. He points to the sinless Man - to the fulfilled idea of Christ. His argument, which all could understand, is summed up in the words, \"Ye are Christ's, and Christ is risen.\" Your resurrection from the death of sin to the life of righteousness is a pledge of your participation in Christ's resurrection from the grave.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-18. - Directions and arrangements. Verse 1. - Now concerning the collection for the saints. \"The saints\" are here the poor Christians at Jerusalem (Romans 15:26). The subject weighed much on St. Paul's mind. First, there was real need for their charity, for at Jerusalem there was as sharp a contrast between the lots of the rich and poor as there is in London, and the \"poor saints,\" being the poorest of the poor (James 2:5), must have often been in deep distress. Not many years before this time, in the famine of Claudius, (Acts 11:27-30), Queen Helena of Adiabene had kept the paupers of Jerusalem alive by importing cargoes of dried grapes and figs. Besides the periodical famines, the political troubles of Judaea had recently increased the general distress. Secondly, the tender heart of St. Paul was keenly alive to this distress. Thirdly, it was the only way in which the Gentile Churches could show their gratitude to the mother Church. Lastly, the Apostle St. Paul had solemnly promised the apostles at Jerusalem that he would remember the poor (Galatians 2:10). Hence he frequently alludes to this collection (2 Corinthians 8, 9 Romans 15:26; Acts 24:17, etc.). The enthusiastic communism of the earliest Christian society in Jerusalem had soon ceased, being, as all experience proves, an impossible experiment under the conditions which regulate all human life, and it may have aggravated the chronic distress. As I have given order; rather, as I arranged. To the Churches of Galatia. Not in his extant letter to the Galatians, but either in a visit three years before this time (Acts 18:28), or by letter. It appears from 2 Corinthians 8:10 that St. Paul had already asked for the contributions of the Corinthians. \"To the Corinthians he proposes the example of the Galatians; to the Macedonians the example of the Corinthians; to the Romans that of the Macedonians and Corinthians. Great is the power of example\" (Bengel). Even so do ye. The aorist implies that they should do it at once.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Upon the first day of the week. This verse can hardly be said to imply any religious observance of the Sunday, which rests rather on Acts 20:7; Revelation 1:10; John 20:19, 26. Lay by him in store. The Greek phrase implies that the laying up was done at home, but when the money was accumulated, it was doubtless brought to the assembly and handed over to the presbyters. As God hath prospered him; rather, whatsoever he has been prospered in; i.e. all that his prosperity may permit. That there be no gatherings when I come; rather, that, when I come, there may then be no collections. When he came he did not wish his attention to be absorbed in serving tables.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send. It is difficult to see why the translators rendered the clause thus, unless they disliked to face the certainty that the apostle must have written many letters which are no longer extant. The true rendering is, Whomsoever ye approve, these I will send with letters. The letters would be letters of introduction or commendation (Acts 18:27; Romans 16:1; 2 Corinthians 3:1) to the apostles at Jerusalem. Your liberality; literally, your grace or favour; i.e. the token of your voluntary affection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If it be meet that I go also. Unless the collection were a substantial proof of the generosity of the Gentile Churches, it would be hardly worth while (ἄξιον) for St. Paul to go too. With me. St. Paul would not take this money himself. His \"religious\" enemies were many, bitter, and unscrupulous, and he would give them no possibility of a handle against him. He makes such arrangements as should place him above suspicion (2 Corinthians 8:20). It turned out that the subscription was an adequate one, and St. Paul accompanied the Corinthian delegates (Romans 15:25; Acts 20:4). The thought that they might visit Jerusalem and see some of the twelve would act as an incentive to the Corinthians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - When I shall pass through Macedonia; rather, when 1 have passed through Macedonia. For I do pass through Macedonia; rather, for 1 mean to pass through Macedonia. We learn from 2 Corinthians 1:15, 16, that it had been St. Paul's intention to sail from Ephesus to Corinth, thence, after a brief stay, to proceed to Macedonia, and on his return to come again for a longer stay at Corinth on his way to Judaea. He had in an Epistle, now lost (see 1 Corinthians 5:9), announced to them this intention, he changed his plan because, in the present disgraceful state of disorganization into which the Church had fallen, he felt that he could not visit them without being compelled to exercise a severity which, he hoped, might be obviated by writing to them and delaying his intended visit. Nothing but his usual delicacy and desire to spare them prevented him from stating all this more fully (2 Corinthians 1:23; 2 Corinthians 2:1). Mistaking the kindness of his purpose, the Corinthians accused him of levity. He defends himself from this charge in the Second Epistle, and he carried out the plan which he here announces (2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 8:1; 2 Corinthians 9:2, 4; 2 Corinthians 12:14; 2 Corinthians 13:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Yea, and winter with you. This he did (Acts 20:3-6). That ye may bring me on my journey. The \"ye\" is emphatic. The acceptance of this favour at their hands was a proof of affection. It was the custom in ancient days to accompany a departing guest for a short distance (Romans 15:24; Acts 15:3; Acts 17:15). Whithersoever I go. St. Paul well knew that some uncertainty must attach to his plans. As it was, he had to change his plan at the last moment. He had meant to sail from Corinth, but, owing to a plot to assassinate him, he was obliged to go overland round by Macedonia (Acts 20:3). Ver. 7 - For I will not see you now by the way; rather, I do not wish to pay you a cursory visit now, as I had originally meant to do. If the Lord permit. The Christians made a rule of adding these phrases in sign of dependence upon God (2 Corinthians 4:19; Acts 18:1; James 4:15; Hebrews 6:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. It is possible that this intention was frustrated by the riot stirred up by the silversmiths (Acts 19:23-41). But, in any case, he stayed at Ephesus nearly as long as he intended, for the riot only occurred when he was already preparing to leave (Acts 19:21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A great door and effectual.

The metaphor of \"a door,\" perhaps suggested by our Lord himself, was common among Christians (2 Corinthians 2:12; Colossians 4:3; Acts 14:27; Revelation 3:8). Many adversaries (Acts 19:1, 8, 9, 19, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Now if Timotheus come. St. Paul bad already sent on Timothy (2 Corinthians 4:17), with Erastus (Acts 19:22), to go to Corinth by way of Macedonia, and prepare for his visit. But possibly he had countermanded these directions when he postponed his own visit. In the uncertainties of ancient travelling, be could not be certain whether his counter order would reach Timothy or not. It appears to have done so, for nothing is said of any visit of Timothy to Corinth, and St. Paul sent Titus. Without fear. Timothy must at this time have been very young (1 Timothy 4:12). As a mere substitute for St. Paul's personal visit, he would be unacceptable. In every allusion to him we find traces of a somewhat timid and sensitive disposition (1 Timothy 5:21-23; 2 Timothy 1:6-8, etc.). He may well, therefore, have shrunk from the thought of meeting the haughty sophisters and disputatious partisans of Corinth. As I also do. \"As a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel\" (Philippians 2:22). St. Paul felt for Timothy a deeper personal tenderness than for any of his other friends, and the companionship of this gentle and devoted youth was one of the chief comforts of his missionary labour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let no man therefore despise him. His youth and modesty seemed to invite a contempt which was only too consonant with the character of the Corinthians. I look for him with the brethren. There was a reason for adding this. The Corinthians would see that any unkindness or contempt shown towards Timothy would at once be reported to St. Paul. Who \"the brethren\" are is not mentioned, for in Acts 19:22 we are only told that Timothy was accompanied by Erastus. Perhaps St. Paul means with the brethren who conveyed this letter (see ver. 12), and who, as he supposed, would meet with Timothy at Corinth, or fall in with him on their return to meet St. Paul in Macedonia. One of these brethren must have been Titus (2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 7:6, 7), and there were two others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - As touching our brother Apollos; rather, but as touching Apollos, the brother. It seems clear from this that the Corinthians, in their letter, had requested that this eloquent and favourite teacher might be sent to them. I greatly desired him to come unto you; rather, I besought him much. There were at Corinth persons malignant enough to have suggested that Paul had refused their request; that he would not send Apollos to them out of jealousy of Apollos's superior oratory, and of the party which assumed his name. St. Paul anticipated this sneer. His nature was much too noble to feel the least jealousy. Both he and Apollos here show themselves in the purest light. His will; literally, there was not will. The word \"will\" most frequently means \"the will of God,\" but if that had been the meaning here, the word would have had the article. It is used of human will in 1 Corinthians 7:37; Ephesians 2:3; 2 Peter 1:21. Here it means that Apollos had decided not to come at present, obviously because his name had been abused for purposes of party faction (1 Corinthians 3:5). This was all the more noble on his part because he seems to have been a special friend of Titus (Titus 3:13). St. Paul would gladly have sent his two ablest and most energetic disciples to this distracted Church. When he shall have convenient time; rather, when a good opportunity offers itself to him. Whether Apollos ever revisited Corinth or not we do not know.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWatch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Watch, etc. The brief impetuous imperatives show a sudden burst of emotion as he draws to a close. The next clause seems like an after-thought. Watchfulness (1 Thessalonians 5:6; 1 Peter 5:8; Revelation 3:2; Revelation 16:15), steadfastness (Philippians 1:27), and strength (Ephesians 6:10; Colossians 1:11; 2 Timothy 2:1), and love (1 Corinthians 13; 1 Peter 4:8, etc.) were frequent subjects of Christian exhortation. The verb which expresses Christian manliness (\"Play the men!\") occurs here only. It is found in the LXX. of Joshua 1:6.

The firstfruits of Achaia. For which reason St. Paul had baptized Stephanas and his house (1 Corinthians 1:16).

This sounds like a reproach in the Authorized Version, but is quite the reverse. It should be rendered, the void caused by your absence.

In some manuscripts (D, E, F, G) and versions (e.g. the Vulgate) we find the addition, \"with whom also I am lodging.\" The Church that is in their house. The time for large common churches for public worship had not yet arrived, Hence, when the Christian community numbered more than could meet in one place, the congregations were held in separate houses (Romans 16:4, 15; Acts 2:46; Colossians 4:15; Philemon 1:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the brethren greet you.

The kiss of peace is mentioned in Romans 16:16; 2 Corinthians 13:12; 1 Peter 5:14. It was a sign of the reconciliation of all dissensions. But the abuse of the practice and the hideous heathen calumnies which it helped to perpetuate, led to its abolition. In the Roman Church a shadow of it still remains in the custom of the congregation kissing the pax after the priest has kissed it. The custom still continues in the Christos voscress of Easter Day in the Greek Church, when -NEWLINENEWLINE\" See! the bearded faces kiss each other:NEWLINEEvery Russian Christian loves his brother.NEWLINESerf or noble, each today may claimNEWLINEFriendly kiss in that all friendly Name.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - With mine own hand. Every one of St. Paul's Epistles, except that to the Galatians (Galatians 6:11), seems to have been written by an amanuensis. The blaze of light in the vision on the road to Damascus seems to have left him with acute and permanent ophthalmia as his \"thorn in the flesh;\" and this would naturally disincline him to the physical labour of writing. When he did write, his letters seem to have been large and straggling (Galatians 6:11), But this was an age in which documents were frequently falsified by designing persons, and this seems to have happened to St. Paul after he had written his very first extant letter. After warning the Thessalonians not to be frightened \"by epistle as from us\" (2 Thessalonians 2:2), he adds, at the close of the letter, that henceforth he intends to authenticate every letter by an autograph salutation (2 Thessalonians 3:17; Colossians 4:18; Romans 16:22). To this bad and dangerous practice of forgery is due the energetic appeal of Revelation 22:18, 19. A similar appeal to copyists, couched in the most solemn language, is found in Irenaeus ('Opp.,' 1:821, edit. Stieren), and at the end of Rufinus's prologue to his translation of Origen's 'De Principiis.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - If any man love not, etc. This sentence (as in Colossians 4:18; Ephesians 6:24) is part of the autograph salutation. The verb here used for \"love\" (philo) was perhaps suggested by the word for \"kiss\" (philema). The word generally used for \"love of God\" is agapae (Ephesians 6:24), which implies less warmth, but deeper reverence. But this passage is full of emotion. Let him be Anathema. The word only occurs elsewhere in 1 Corinthians 12:3; Acts 23:13; Romans 9:3; Galatians 1:8, 9 (comp. Matthew 26:74, \"to curse\"). It is the equivalent of the Hebrew cherem, a ban (Leviticus 27:29; Joshua 6:17, etc.). I cannot pretend to understand what St. Paul means by it, unless it be \"Let personal love to Christ be the essential of Christian fellowship, and let him who has it not be regarded as apart from the Church.\" Commentators call it \"an imprecation,\" or \"malediction,\" and say that it means \"Let him be devoted to God's wrath and judgment.\" That language is, indeed, very like the language of religious hatred and religious usurpation in all ages, but it is the very antithesis to the general tone of the apostle. If this were the meaning, it would seem to resemble the very spirit which Christ himself severely rebuked as the Elijah spirit, not the Christ spirit. But I do not believe that, even in a passing outburst of strong emotion, St. Paul had any such meaning. ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the Jews used cherem, not only of the severer form of excommunication (shem atha), but even of the milder and by no means severe temporary form (nidui); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it cannot be more severe than \"handing over to Satan\" (1 Corinthians 5:5; 1 Timothy 1:20), which was merciful in its purpose. Maran-atha; two words, the Lord cometh; like the Jewish shem atha, \"the Name cometh,\" or, \"the Lord comes.\" It seems to be an appeal to the judgment of Christ, and may possibly have been an allusion to Malachi 4:6, the words with which the Old Testament ends (see Jude 1:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

Here it is the same as in 1 Thessalonians 5:28. \"With you all\" is added in 2 Thessalonians 3:18; Romans 16:24; Philippians 4:23. In Galatians and Philemon we have \"with your spirit.\" In the pastoral Epistles and Colossians, \"Peace be with you.\" In Ephesians 6:24 it is confined to those \"who love the Lord Jesus in sincerity.\" In 2 Corinthians 13:14 alone we have the full \"apostolic benediction.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy love be with you all in Christ Jesus.

Perhaps genuine, though omitted by B, F, G. The superscription to the Epistle, rightly omitted in the Revised Version, does not possess the smallest authority, and is absolutely erroneous. It contains two positive misstatements, which show with what utter carelessness these superscriptions were written in the later manuscripts. The Epistle was not written from Philippi (a mere mistaken inference from 1 Corinthians 16:5), but from Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:8), and was not conveyed by Timotheus.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPaul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Paul. After the beginning of the first missionary journey (A.D. 45) he seems to have finally abandoned his Hebrew name of Saul. Called. The word \"called\" is absent from A, D, E, and other manuscripts, but may have been omitted as superfluous. It occurs in the greeting of Romans 1:1, but not in any other Epistle. The words might also be rendered \"a called or chosen apostle.\" To be an apostle. He uses this title in every letter except the private one to Philemon, the peculiarly friendly and informal one to the Philippians, and the two to the Thessalonians, which were written before the Judaizers had challenged his claim to this title in its more special sense. The Epistle to the Romans is the first in which he calls himself \"a slave of Jesus Christ\" (comp. Philippians 1:1; Titus 1:1; James 1:1; 2 Peter 1:1; Jude 1). It was necessary for him to assert his right to the apostolate in the highest sense of the word, as one who had received from Christ himself an authority equal to that of the twelve (see 1 Corinthians 9:1-5; 1 Corinthians 15:9; 2 Corinthians 11:5; 2 Corinthians 12:11, 12; Galatians 1:1-19, etc.). Of Jesus Christ. In the Gospels the word \"Christ\" is all but invariably \"the Christ,\" i.e. the Anointed, the Messiah. It is the designation of the office of Jesus as the promised Deliverer. We trace in the New Testament the gradual transition of the word from a title into a proper name. In the two names together our Lord is represented as \"the Saviour,\" and the anointed Prophet, Priest, and King, first of the chosen people and then of all mankind. Through the will of God (comp. 2 Corinthians 1 Ephesians Colossians 2 Timothy 1:1). This special call to the apostleship is emphatically expanded in Galatians 1:1. The vindication of the Divine and independent claim was essential to St. Paul's work. It was not due to any personal considerations, but to the necessity of proving that no human authority could be quoted to overthrow the gospel which was peculiarly \"his gospel\" (see Galatians 1:11; Ephesians 3:8), of which one main feature was the freedom of the Gentiles from the yoke of Judaic bondage. And Soathenes. The association of one or more brethren with himself in the greeting of his letters is peculiar to St. Paul. Silas and Timothy are associated with him in 1 and 2 Thessalonians; and Timothy, though so much his junior, in 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon; doubtless he would have been associated with St. Paul in this Epistle had he not been absent (1 Corinthians 4:17; 1 Corinthians 16:10). The practice arose partly from St. Paul's exquisite courtesy and consideration towards his companions, partly from his shrinking from mere personal prominence. It is owing to the same reasons that in the earlier Epistles he constantly uses \"we\" for \"I,\" and sometimes when he can only be speaking of himself (1 Thessalonians 2:18). But even in the Epistles to the Thessalonians he sometimes relapses from \"we\" into \"I\" (2 Thessalonians 2:5). Our brother; literally, the brother; i.e. one of \"the brethren\" (comp. 2 Corinthians 1:1). Of Sosthenes nothing whatever is known. He may possibly be the amanuensis whom St. Paul employed for this letter. Later tradition, which in such matters is perfectly valueless, spoke of him as\" one of the seventy disciples, and Bishop of Colophon\" (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:12). There is a Jewish Sosthenes, a ruler of the synagogue, in Acts 18:17; but it is only a vague conjecture that he may have been subsequently converted, and may have joined St. Paul at Ephesus. It is obvious that the persons named in the greetings of the Epistles were not in any way supposed to be responsible for their contents, lot St. Paul begins with \"I\" in ver. 4. Brother. At this time there was no recognized title for Christians. In the Acts they are vaguely spoken of as \"those of this way.\" Among themselves they were known as \"the saints,\" \"the faithful,\" \"the elect.\" The name \"Christians\" was originally a nickname devised by the Antiochenes. In the New Testament it only occurs as a designation used by enemies (Acts 11:26; Acts 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Unto the Church. This form of address is used in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. In St. Paul's later Epistles, for some unknown reason, he prefers the address \"to the saints.\" These forms of address show the absence of any fixed ecclesiastical government. He does not in this Epistle address any \"bishops\" or \"presbyters\" whom he might regard as responsible for the growing disorders which prevailed at Corinth, but he appeals to the whole Church. The word ecclesia - signifying those who were \"called out of the world,\" and so primarily applied to \"the congregation of Israel\" - came ultimately to mean \"a congregation.\" The only apostle who uses the word \"synagogue\" of the Christian assemblies is St. James (James 2:2). Of God. Not the Church of this or that party leader. Some commentators give to these words an emphasis and importance which does not seem to belong to them. Which is at Corinth. So in 2 Corinthians 1:2. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians he prefers the form, \"the Church of the Thessalonians.\" \"The Church at Corinth\" was an expression which involved the sharpest of contrasts. It brought into juxtaposition the holiest ideal of the new faith and the vilest degradations of the old paganism. It was \"a glad and great paradox\" (Bengel). The condition of society at Corinth, at once depraved and sophistical, throws light on many parts of the Epistle. Cicero describes the city as \"illustrious a like for wantonness, opulence, and the study of philosophy.\" Even them that are sanctified. The apostles could only write to Churches as being really Churches, and to Christians as being true Christians. In all general addresses they could only assume that the actual resembled the ideal. They never conceal the immense chasm which separated the real condition of many members of their Churches from the vocation which they professed. They knew also that it is (as Calvin says) \"a perilous temptation to refuse the name of Church to every Church in which there is not perfect purity.\" Ideally even the Corinthian Christians were redeemed by Christ's expiation, consecrated and sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit. They could only be addressed in accordance with their ostensible position (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1; 5:68). Our Prayer book is constructed on the same principle. The harvest is still a harvest, though amongst the corn there may be many tares. In Christ Jesus. The words, \"in Christ,\" constitute what has been happily called \"the monogram of St. Paul.\" The life of the true Christian is no longer his own. The Christ for him has become the Christ in him. His natural life is merged into a higher spiritual life. Baptized into Christ, he has become one with Christ. Called to be saints. (On this Christian calling, see Ephesians 4:1, 4; 2 Thessalonians 1:11; 2 Timothy 1:9; Hebrews 3:1; 2 Peter 1:10.) They are called to be united saints, not schismatic partisans or members of antagonistic cliques. The description of what they were ideally is the more emphatic because he feels how much they had fallen away. With all that... in every place. Perhaps this may mean the same as 2 Corinthians 1:1, \"With all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia;\" or the words may imply that St. Paul's exhortations are applicable to all Christians, wherever they may be and (as is expressed in the next clause) whatever may be their varying shades of individual opinion. It was well in any case to remind the Corinthians that they formed but a fraction of the Christian communities. Catholicity, not provincialism, makes the true Church of God. Call upon the Name. The Greek verb is here in the middle voice, not \"who are called by the Name\"(comp. James 2:7; Amos 9:12, LXX.). It means, therefore, all who reverence the Name of Christ, all who adore their one \"Lord\" in the fulness of his nature (see Joel 3:5; Acts 2:21; Romans 10:24; 2 Timothy 2:22, etc.); in other words, \"all who profess and call themselves Christians\" (comp. Acts 25:11). Their Lord and ours. I connect these words, not with \"place,\" as in the Vulgate, In omni loco ipsorum et nostro - which, however it may be twisted, can give no good sense - but with \"Jesus Christ.\" It has been in all ages a fatal temptation of party Christians to claim a monopoly of Christ for themselves and their own sects, as though they only taught the gospel, and were the only Christians or the only \"Evangelicals.\" But Christ cannot thus be \"parcelled into fragments\" (see vers. 12, 13), nor has any party a right to boast exclusively, \"I am of Christ.\" The addition, \"and ours,\" could not be regarded as super fluous in writing to a Church of which one section wanted to assert an exclusive right in Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGrace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Grace to you and peace. This is St. Paul's greeting in all the Epistles except the pastoral Epistles, in which he beautifully adds the word \"mercy.\" It is a remarkable blending of the Greek and Jewish salutations. The Greeks said Ξαίρειν, and to them the word \"grace\" involved the notions of joy and brightness and prosperity. The calmer and more solemn greeting of the East was, \"Peace be to thee.\" The Church unites both forms of greeting - \"grace,\" the beginning of every blessing; \"peace,\" the end of all blessings; and into both she infuses a deeper meaning, that of a \"joy\" which defied all tribulations, and a\" peace which passeth all understanding.\" From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. God is the Source of \"every good gift and every perfect gift.\" God is our Father as our Creator, and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we become, in a higher sense, his children. Christ, in his mediatorial kingdom, is specially and immediately \"our Lord,\" though that phrase, now so universal, only occurs (in its isolated form) in Hebrews 7:14. Jesus Christ. One of St. Paul's peculiarities of style is the constant reiteration of one dominant word. In the first nine verses of this Epistle, the Name \"Jesus Christ\" is repeated no less than nine times. \"Observe,\" says St. Chrysostom, \"how he nails them down to the Name of Christ, not mentioning any man, either apostle or teacher, but continually mentioning him for whom they yearn, as men preparing to awaken those who are drowsy after a debauch. For nowhere in any other Epistle is the Name of Christ so continually introduced By means of it he weaves together almost his whole exordium.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-9. - The thanksgiving. The thanksgiving is a feature in almost every Epistle of St. Paul, except the Epistle to the Galatians, in which he plunges at once into severe reprobation. Verse 4. - I thank my God. It is probable, from papyrus rolls in the British Museum, that the general form and outline of letters was more or less conventional. In St. Paul, however, this thanksgiving is the natural overflow of a full heart. It was no mere compliment or rhetorical artifice like the captatio benevolentiae, or endeavouring to win the hearers by flattery, which we find in most ancient speeches. My God (Romans 1:8). Always; that is, constantly; on all occasions of special prayer. He could still thank God for them, though his letter was written \"with many tears\" (2 Corinthians 2:4). For the grace of God. The grace (χάρις) of spiritual life showing itself in many special spiritual gifts (χαρίσματα), such as \"the gift of tongues.\" Which was given you. This is one of St. Paul's \"baptismal aorists.\" He always regards and speaks of the life of the soul as summed up potentially in one supreme moment and crisis - namely, the moment of conversion and baptism. The grace given once was given for ever, and was continually manifested. In Christ Jesus. St. Paul regarded the life of the Christian as \"hid with Christ in God,\" and of Christ as being the Christian's life (see Romans 6:23; 2 Corinthians 4:10, 11; Colossians 3:3, 4; 2 Timothy 1:1; 1 John 5:11, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In everything; i.e. of course, every gift which belongs specially to the Christian life. In all utterance; i.e. in all \"eloquence\" (λόγῳ), or perhaps \"in all doctrine\" (so Luther, Calvin, Meyer, etc.). The word for\" utterance\" is rhema; logos means \"discourse\" and \"reason\" (comp. 2 Corinthians 8:7). Knowledge. From the word guests is derived the name Gnostic, which was applied to so many forms of ancient heresy. There was danger to the Corinthian Christians in the exaggerated estimate of what they took for gnosis, and many of them were tempted to pride themselves on purely intellectual attainments, which were valueless for the spiritual life.

The \"gifts\" are here the charismata, graces, such as powers of healing, etc., which were the result of the outpouring of the Spirit. The sequel shows that they were rather outward than inward; they were splendid endowments rather than spiritual fruits. Yet even these were not wholly wanting, as we see from 2 Corinthians 8:7. The Greek may also mean \"causing you not to be conscious of inferiority.\" Waiting; expecting, not fearing it, This was the constant attitude of the early Christians (Romans 8:19-25; Philippians 3:20; Hebrews 9:20; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; Colossians 3:4; Titus 2:13). Love for Christ's manifestation was a Christian characteristic (2 Timothy 4:8). The revelation. Three words are used to express the second advent: apokalypsis (as here and in 2 Thessalonians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:7, 13); parousia (as in Matthew 24:3, 27, etc.; 1 Thessalonians 2:19; James 5:7, 8, etc.); and epiphaneia, in the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 2 Timothy 4:1-8; Titus 2:13). St. Paul, however, only uses parousia six times in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and once in 1 Corinthians 15:23. All Christians alike expected the return of Christ very soon, and possibly in their own lifetime (1 Thessalonians 1:9, 10, etc.; 1 Corinthians 15:51; James 5:8, 9; 1 Peter 4:7; 1 John 2:18; Revelation 22:20, etc.). Their expectation was founded on the great eschatological discourse of our Lord (Matthew 24:29, 30, 34), and on his express promise that that generation should not pass away before his predictions were fulfilled. They were fulfilled in the fall of Jerusalem and the close of the old dispensation, though they await a stilt more universal fulfilment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Who; clearly Christ, though his Name is again repeated in the next clause.

This natural expression of the apostle's yearning hope for them must not be overpressed into any such doctrine as \"the indefectibility of grace.\" All honest and earnest students must resist the tendency to strain the meaning of Scripture texts into endless logical inferences which were never intended to be deduced from them. Unto the end; namely, to the end of \"this age,\" and to the coming of Christ (Matthew 28:20; Hebrews 3:6, 13; Hebrews 6:11). That ye be unreprovable; rather, unimpeached (anenkletous), as in Colossians 1:22; 1 Timothy 3:18; Titus 1:6. It is not the word rendered \"blameless\" (amemptos) in Philippianws 2:15 or in 2 Peter 3:14. A Christian can only be \"blameless,\" not as being sinless, but as having been forgiven, renewed, sanctified (1 Corinthians 6:11; Romans 8:30). In the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the same as the apokalypsis or parousia. It is sometimes called simply \"the day\" (comp. 1 Corinthians 3:13; Acts 1:20; Joel 3:4; 2 Thessalonians 1:10; Revelation 6:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - God is faithful. He will not leave his promises unfulfilled or his work unfinished (1 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Thessalonians 3:3; Hebrews 10:23; Romans 8:28-30). Through whom. By whom, as the moving cause and agent in your salvation. Ye were called. The calling was a pledge of the final blessing (Romans 8:30). Into the fellowship of his Son. Union (koinonia, communion) with Christ is the sole means of spiritual life (John 15:4; Galatians 2:20). Through the Son we also have fellowship with the Father (1 John 1:3). The perfect sincerity of the apostle is observable in this thanksgiving. He speaks of the Church in general in terms of gratitude and hopefulness, and dwells on its rich spiritual endowments; but he has not a word of praise for any moral advance such as that which he so lovingly recognized in the Thessalonians and Philippians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-17. - Party spirit at Corinth. This subject is pursued in various forms to 1 Corinthians 4:21. Verse 10. - Now. The particle implies the transition from thanksgiving to reproof. Brethren. This very title involves an appeal to them to aim at unity among themselves; and St. Paul, like St. James (James 5:10), uses it to soften any austerity which might seem to exist in his language (1 Corinthians 7:29; 1 Corinthians 10:1; 1 Corinthians 14:20, etc.). Through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; that is, by the whole idea of Christ's being and office - the strongest bond of union between true Christians (see the powerful appeal in Ephesians 4:1-6). That ye all speak the same thing; that is, \"that ye may all with one mind and one mouth glorify God\" (Romans 15:6). They were doing the very reverse - each glorifying himself and his party (ver. 12). Divisions (σχίσματα); \"schisms\" used of bodies within the Church, not of separatists from it (1 Corinthians 11:18). The word is only used in this special sense in this Epistle. In Matthew 9:16 and Mark 2:21 schisma means \"a rent;\" in John (John 7:43; John 9:16; John 10:19), \"a division of opinion.\" There would be little or no harm in the schismata so far as they affected unessential points, if it was not their fatal tendency to end in \"contentions\" (erides) and \"factions\" (haireseis, 1 Corinthians 11:19). Corinth was a place where such divisions would be likely to spring up, partly from the disputatious vivacity and intellectual conceits of the inhabitants, partly from the multitudes of strangers who constantly visited the port, partly from the numerous diversities of previous training through which the various sections of converts had passed. Perfected together; literally, repaired, reunited. In the same mind and in the same judgment; that is, in what they think and believe (νοὶ), and in what they assert and do (γνώμῃ). The exhortation, \"be of one mind,\" in every sense of the word, was as necessary in the ancient as in the modern Church (Romans 15:5; 2 Corinthians 13:11; Philippians 1:27; Philippians 2:2; 1 Peter 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - It hath been signified unto me. He had heard these saddening rumours towards the close of his stay in Ephesus. By them which are of the household of Chloe. The Greek only has \"by them of Chloe. St. Paul wisely and kindly mentions his authority for these reports. Nothing is known of Chloe or her household. It has been conjectured that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, Corinthians who were now with St. Paul at Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:16), may have been Chloe's slaves or freedmen. Contentions. These are the works of the flesh (2 Corinthians 12:20; Galatians 5:20; 1 Timothy 6:4). The condition of the Church was the same when St. Clement of Rome wrote to them. He had still to complain of the \"strange and alien and, for the elect of God, detest able and unholy spirit of faction which a few rash and self willed persons kindled to such a pitch of dementation\" ('Ep. ad Corinthians 1.').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Now this I mean; in other words, \"what I mean is this.\" Their \"contentions\" are defined to be equivalent to \"religious partisanships; \"antagonistic adoption of the names and views of special teachers. Each one of you saith. That party spirit ran so high that they were all listed on one side or another. None of them were wise enough and spiritual minded enough to hold aloof from parties altogether. They prided themselves on being \"uncompromising\" and \"party men.\" Saith; in a self-assertive way (1 Corinthians 3:21). I am of Paul. He shows his indignation at their partisanship by first rebuking those who had used his own name as a party watchward. He disliked Paulinism as much as Petrinism (Bengel). All the Corinthians would probably have been in this sense Paulinists but for the visits of subsequent teachers. At present the Paul party consisted of those who adhered to his views about Gentile freedom, and who liked the simple spirituality of his teaching. St. Paul rose above the temptation of considering that party spirit is excusable in our own partisans. He reproves factiousness even in the party of freedom. And I of Apollos. Apollos personally was absolutely loyal and honourable, but his visit to Corinth had done mischief. His impassioned oratory, his Alexandrian refinements, his allegorizing exegesis, the culture and polish of his style, had charmed the fickle Corinthians. The Apollonians were the party of culture. They had, as we see from later parts of the Epistle, exaggerated St. Paul's views, as expounded by Apollos, into extravagance. Puffed up with the conceit of knowledge, they had fallen into moral inconsistency. The egotism of oratorical rivals, the contemptuous tone to wards weaker brethren, the sophistical condonations of vice, were probably due to them. Apollos, as we see by his noble refusal to visit Corinth under present circumstances (1 Corinthians 16:12), was as indignant as St. Paul himself at the perversion of his name into an engine of party warfare. (On Apollos, see Acts 18:24-28; Acts 19:1 Titus 3:13.) Nothing further is known respecting him, but he is the almost undoubted author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which proves that he was of the school of St. Paul, while at the same time he showed a splendid originality in his way of arriving at the same conclusion as his teacher. I of Cephas. The use of the Aramaic name (1 Corinthians 3:22; 1 Corinthians 9:5; 1 Corinthians 15:6; Galatians 2:9), perhaps, shows that these Petrinists were Judaizers (though it should be added that St. Paul only uses the name \"Peter\" in Galatians 2:7, 8). They personally disliked St. Paul, and questioned his apostolical authority. Perhaps the extravagances of the \"speaking with tongues\" arose in this party, who recalled the effects of the outpouring of the Spirit after Peter's great sermon on the day of Pentecost. And I of Christ. We trace the origin of this party to one man in particular (2 Corinthians 2:7), who was, or professed to be, an adherent of James, and therefore one of the more rigid Judaizers. He may have been one from the circle of Christ's earthly relatives - one of the Desposyni (see 1 Corinthians 9:5), and, like St. James, may have had views resembling those of the Essenes and Ebionites. If so, he was probably the author of the questions about celibacy and marriage; and perhaps he prided himself on having seen \"Christ in the flesh.\" This party at any rate, like some modern sects, was not ashamed to degrade into a party watchword even the sacred name of Christ, and to claim for a miserable clique an exclusive interest in the Lord of the whole Church. It is the privilege of every Christian to say, \"Christianus sum;\" but if he says it in a haughty, loveless, and exclusive spirit, he forfeits his own claim to the title. This exclusive Christ party is, perhaps, specially alluded to in 2 Corinthians 10:7-11. The view of Chrysostom, which takes these words to be St. Paul's remark - \"But I belong to Christ,\" is untenable, and would make trim guilty of the very self-assertiveness which he is reprobating.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Is Christ divided? Has Christ been parcelled into fragments? \"Is there a Pauline, a Petrine, an Apollonian, a Christian Christ?\" Whether you call yourselves Liberals, or Intellectualists, or Catholics, or Bible Christians, your party spirit is a sin, and all the worse a sin because it pranks itself out in the guise of pure religious zeal. This is more forcible than to take the clause affirmatively:\" Christ has been parcelled into fragments.\" In either ease we see\" the tragic result of party spirit.\" Was Paul crucified for you? Again he rebukes the partisanship which attached itself to his own name. This showed a splendid courage and honesty. The introduction of the question by the negative μὴ expresses astonished indignation: \"Can you possibly make a watchword of the name of a mere man, as though he had been crucified for you?\" This outburst of feeling is very important, as proving the immeasurable distance which, in Paul's own view, separated him from his Lord. It is also instructive to see how St. Paul at once denounces the spirit of party without deigning to enter into the question as to which party of these wrangling \"theologians\" was most or least in the right. He did not choose to pander to their sectarian spirit by deciding between their various forms of aggressive orthodoxy. Into the name (comp. Matthew 28:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I thank God that I baptized none of you. St. Paul, in his characteristic manner, \"goes off at the word\" baptize. He thanked God, not by way of any disparagement to baptism, but because he had thus given no excuse to the undue exaltation of his own name. Compare the practice of our Lord himself, in leaving his disciples to baptize (John 4:2). The apostles would not have approved the system of wholesale baptisms of the heathen which has prevailed in some Romanist missions. Save Crispus. The ruler of the synagogue (Acts 18:8). Doubtless there were some strong special reasons why, in these instances, St. Paul departed from his general rule of not personally baptizing his converts. And Gaius. Gaius of Corinth (Romans 16:23). It was one of the commonest of names. There was another Gaius of Derbe (Acts 20:4), and another known to St. John (3 John 1:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I had baptized.

This he recalls by an afterthought being, perhaps, reminded of it by Stephanas himself. The household of Stephanas. Stephanas and his house were the first converts in Achaia (1 Corinthians 16:5). When converts became more numerous, St. Paul ceased to baptize them personally (comp. Acts 10:48). I know not. The inspiration of the apostles involved none of the mechanical infallibility ascribed to them by popular dogma, He forgot whether he had baptized any one else or not, but this made no difference as regards his main argument.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Sent me not to baptize, but; that is, according to Semitic idiom, \"not so much to baptize, as\" (Matthew 28:19). The word \"sent\" (apesteilen) involves the meaning \"made me an apostle\" (apostolos). The primary function of the apostles was \"to bear witness\" (Mark 16:15; Acts 1:8, etc.). To preach the gospel. St. Paul again \"goes off\" at this word, and dwells for eight verses on the character of his preaching. Not in wisdom of words; not, that is, in a philosophic and oratorical style. The simplicity of the style and teaching of the apostles awoke the sneers of philosophers like Celsus and Porphyry. The cross of Christ. The central doctrine of Christianity, the preaching of a crucified Redeemer. Should be made void. The rendering of the Authorized Version is too strong; the cross cannot \"be made of none effect.\" The word means \"should be emptied\" (comp. 1 Corinthians 9:15; 2 Corinthians 9:3; Philippians 2:7; Romans 4:14); made void of its special and independent power. The words, \"the cross of Christ,\" form the emphatic end of the sentence in the Greek.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-25. - The nature of true Christian preaching. Verse 18. - For the preaching of the cross; rather, the word of the cross. To them that are perishing; rather, to the perishing; to all those who are now walking in the paths that lead to destruction (2 Corinthians 2:15). To them it was foolishness, because it requires spiritual discernment (1 Corinthians 2:14); and, on the other hand, human wisdom is foolishness with God (1 Corinthians 3:19). Foolishness. It shows the heroic character of the faith of St. Paul that he deliberately preached the doctrine of the cross because he felt that therein lay the conversion and salvation of the world, although he was well aware that he could preach no truth so certain at first to revolt the unregenerate hearts of his hearers. To the Jews \"the cross\" was the tree of shame and horror; and a crucified person was \"accursed of God\" (Deuteronomy 21:23; Galatians 3:13). To the Greeks the cross was the gibbet of a slave's infamy and a murderer's punishment. There was not a single association connected with it except those of shame and agony. The thought of \"a crucified Messiah\" seemed to the Jews a revolting folly; the worship of a crucified malefactor seemed to the Greeks \"an execrable superstition\" (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44; Pliny, 'Epp.' 10:97); yet so little did St. Paul seek for popularity or immediate success, that this was the very doctrine which he put in the forefront, even at a city so refined and so voluptuous as Corinth. And the result proved his inspired wisdom. That very cross became the recognized badge of Christianity, and when three centuries had elapsed it was woven in gold upon the banners and set in jewels on the diadems of the Roman empire. For had not Christ prophesied, And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me\"? Unto us which are being saved; who are on the way of salvation. The same present participle is used in Luke 13:23; Acts 2:47; 2 Corinthians 2:15; Revelation 21:24. It is the power of God. Because the cross is at the heart of that gospel which is \"the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth\" (Romans 1:16; Romans 8:3), though many were tempted to be ashamed of it. It could never be a carnal weapon of warfare, and yet was mighty for every purpose (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - It is written. This formula (1 Corinthians 1:31; 1 Corinthians 2:9; 1 Corinthians 3:19; 1 Corinthians 9:9; 1 Corinthians 10:7; 1 Corinthians 15:45; 2 Corinthians 8:15) is chiefly used in letters to Churches in which there were many Jews. This is a free citation from the LXX. of Isaiah 29:14 (the same thought is found in Job 5:12, 13; see too Matthew 11:25). The original passage refers to penal judgments from the Assyrians, which would test the false prophets of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Where is the wise? etc. (Isaiah 33:18); rather, Where is a wise man? i.e. a scribe, etc., which is even more incisive. These questions are triumphant, like the \"Where is the King of Hamath and of Arpad?\" The same impassioned form of speech recurs in 1 Corinthians 15:55 and in Romans 3:27. The questions would come home to the Jews, who regarded their rabbis and the \"pupils of the wise as exalted beings who could look down on all poor ignorant persons (amharatsim, or \"people of the land\"); and to the Greeks, who regarded none but the philosophers as \"wise.\" The scribe. With the Jews of that day\" the scribe\" was\" the theologian,\" the ideal of dignified learning and orthodoxy, though for the most part he mistook elaborate ignorance for profound knowledge. The disputer. The word would specially suit the disputatious Greeks, clever dialecticians. The verb from which this word is derived occurs in Mark 8:11, and the abstract substantive (\"an eager discussion\") in Acts 28:29. If St. Paul has Isaiah 33:18 in his mind, the word \"disputer\" corresponds to \"the counter of the towers\" (comp. Psalm 48:12). Even the rabbis say that when Messiah comes human wisdom is to become needless. Of the world; rather, of this age, or aeon. The old dispensation, then so rapidly waning to its close, was called \"this age\" (olam hazzeh); the next or Messianic age was called \"the age to come\" (olam habba). The Messianic age had dawned at the birth of Christ, but the old covenant was not finally annulled till his second coming at the fall of Jerusalem. Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? rather, Did not God (by the cross) stultify the wisdom, etc.? The oxymoron, or sharp contrast of terms - a figure of which St. Paul is fond (see 1 Timothy 5:6; Romans 1:20, etc.; and my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:628) - is here clearly marked in the Greek. The thought was as familiar to the old prophets (Isaiah 44:25) as to St. Paul (Romans 1:22); and even Horace saw that heathen philosophy was sometimes no better than insaniens sapientia (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:34, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - In the wisdom of God; that is, as a part of his Divine economy. The world through its wisdom knew not God. These words might be written as an epitaph on the tomb of ancient philosophy, and of modern philosophy and science so far as it assumes an anti-Christian form (Luke 10:21). Human wisdom, when it relies solely on itself, may \"feel after God,\" but hardly find him (Acts 17:26, 27). Through the foolishness of the preaching. This is a mis-translation. It would require keruxeos, not kerugmatos. It should be by the foolishness (as men esteemed it) of the thing preached.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Jews ask for signs; rather, Jews demand signs. This had been their incessant demand during our Lord's ministry; nor would they be content with any sign short of a sign from heaven (Matthew 12:38: 16:1; John 2:18; John 4:48, etc.). This had been steadily refused them by Christ, who wished them rather to see spiritual signs (Luke 17:20, 21). Greeks seek after wisdom. St. Paul at Athens had found himself surrounded with Stoics and Epicureans, and the same new thing which every one was looking for mainly took the shape of philosophic novelties (Acts 17:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Christ crucified; rather perhaps, a crucified Messiah. It was only by slow degrees that the title \"the Christ,\" i.e. the Anointed, the Messiah, passed into the name Christ. A stumbling block. They had for centuries been looking for a regal and victorious Messiah, who should exalt their special privileges. The notion of a suffering and humiliated Messiah, who reduced them to the level of all God's other children, was to them \"a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence\" (Romans 9:33; comp. Isaiah 8:14). These two verses, translated into Syriac, furnish a marked play on words (miscol, stumbling block; mashcal, folly; seed, cross); and some have seen in this a sign that St. Paul thought in Syriac. Unto the Greeks; rather, unto Gentiles; א, A, B, C, I). Unto the Jews... unto the Greeks. Both alike had failed. The Jew had not attained ease of conscience or moral perfectness; the Greek had. not unriddled the secret of philosophy; yet both alike rejected the peace and the enlightenment which they had professed to seek. Foolishness. The accent of profound contempt is discernible in all the early allusions of Greeks and Romans to Christianity. The only epithets which they could find for it were \"execrable,\" \"malefic,\" \"depraved,\" \"damnable\" (Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, etc.). The milder term is \"excessive superstition.\" The heroic constancy of martyrs appeared even to M. Aurelius only under the aspect of a \"bare obstinacy.\" The word used to express the scorn of the Athenian philosophers for St. Paul's \"strange doctrine\" is one of the coarsest disdain (ἐχλεύαζον), and they called him \"a seed pecker\" (Acts 17:18, 32), i.e. a mere picker up of \"learning's crumbs.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Unto them that are called (see Romans 8:28); literally, to the called themselves. Both Jews and Greeks. Henceforth the middle wall of partition between them is thrown down, and there is no difference (Romans 9:24). Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. These words are a summary of the gospel. St. Paul is the best commentator on himself. He speaks elsewhere of \"the exceeding greatness of God's power to usward who believe which he wrought in Christ\" (Ephesians 1:17-20), and of \"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\" as being \"hid in Christ\" (Colossians 2:3). And the world, once so scornful, has learnt that Christ is indeed the Power of God. When Rudolph of Hapsburgh was being crowned, and in the hurry no sceptre could be found, he seized a crucifix, and swore that that should be his only sceptre. When St. Thomas of Aquinum asked St. Bonaventura what was the source of his immense learning, he pointed in silence to his crucifix.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The foolishness of God... the weakness of God; the method, that is, whereby God works, and which men take to be foolish and weak, because with arrogant presumption they look upon themselves as the measure of all things. But God achieves the mightiest ends by the humblest means, and the gospel of Christ allied itself from the first, not with the world's strength and splendour, but with all which the world despised as mean and feeble - with fishermen and tax gatherers, with slaves, and women, and artizans. The lesson was specially needful to the Corinthians, whom Cicero describes ('De Leg. Age,' 2:32) as \"famous, not only for their luxuriousness, but also for their wealth and philosophic culture.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-31. - The method of God in the spread of the gospel. Verse 26. - For behold; or, consider (imperative, as in 1 Corinthians 10:15; Philippians 3:2). Your calling; the nature and method of your heavenly calling; the \"principle God has followed in calling you\" (Beza); see Ephesians 4:1; Hebrews 3:1. Not many wise after the flesh. Those who hear the calling arc alone the truly wise; but they are net wise with a carnal wisdom, not wise as men count wisdom; they have but little of the wisdom of the serpent and the wisdom of \"this age.\" The Sanhedrin looked down on the apostles as \"unlearned and ignorant men\" (Acts 4:13). \"God,\" says St. Augustine, \"caught orators by fishermen, not fishermen by orators.\" Not many mighty; i.e. not many persons of power and influence. Almost the first avowed Gentile Christian of the highest rank was the consul Flavius Clemens, uncle of the Emperor Domitian. This was the more marked because the Jews won many rich and noble proselytes, such as the Queen Helena and the royal family of Adiabene, Poppaea the wife of Nero, and others. The only illustrious converts mentioned in the New Testament are Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, Sergius Paulus, and Dionysius the Areopagitc. Not many noble. All this was a frequent taunt against Christians, but they made it their boast. Christianity came to redeem and elevate, not the few, but the many, and the many must ever be the weak and the humble. Hence Christ called fishermen as his apostles, and was known as \"the Friend of publicans and sinners.\" None of the rulers believed on him (John 7:48). It must, however, be borne in mind that these words apply mainly and primarily to the first age of Christianity. It was essential that its victory should be due to Divine weapons only, and that it should shake the world \"by the irresistible might of weakness.\" After a time, the wisest and the noblest and the most powerful were called. Kings became the nursing fathers of the gospel, and queens its nursing mothers. Yet the ideal truth remains, and human power shows utter weakness, and human wisdom is capable of sinking into the depths of folly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - God chose; not, hath chosen out. We may remark, once for all, that there was no reason why the translators of 1611 should thus have turned the Greek aorists of the New Testament into perfects. In this and in many instances the change of tense is unimportant, but sometimes it materially and injuriously affects the sense. The foolish things... the weak things. So, too, the psalmist, \"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength\" (Psalm 8:2); and St. James, \"Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith?\" (James 2:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And the base things; literally, low-born, unborn; \"those who are sprung kern no one in particular\" - nullo patre, nullis majoribus. Nothing could be more ignoble in the eyes of the world than a cross of wood upheld by feeble hands, and yet before it \"kings and their armies did flee and were discomfited, and they of the household divided the spoil.\" And the things that are not. The not is the Greek subjective negative (μὴ); things of which men conceived as not existing - \"nonentities.\" It is like the expression of Clement of Rome, \"Things accounted as nothing.\" Christianity was \"the little stone, cut without hands,\" which God called into existence. We find the same thought in St. John the Baptist's sermon (Matthew 3:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat no flesh should glory in his presence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - That no flesh should glory. For the weak instruments of God's triumphs are so weak that it was impossible for them to ascribe any power or merit to themselves. In contemplating the victory of the cross, the world could only exclaim, \"This hath God wrought.\" \"It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - But of him are ye in Christ Jesus. Ye do not belong to the wise and noble. Your strength will consist in acknowledged weakness; for it is solely derived from your fellowship with God by your unity with Christ. Who was made unto us, etc. These words rather mean, \"Who was made unto us wisdom from God - both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" The text is a singularly full statement of the whole result of the work of Christ. as the source of \"all spiritual blessings in things heavenly\" (Ephesians 1:3), in whom we are complete (Colossians 2:10). Righteousness (see 2 Corinthians 5:21). \"Jehovah-tsidkenu - the Lord our Righteousness\" (Jeremiah 23:5). This is the theme of Romans 3:7. Sanctification (see especially 1 Corinthians 6:11 and Ephesians 5:25, 26). Redemption. One of the four main metaphors by which the atonement is described is this of ransom (λύτρον ἀπολύτρωσις). The meaning and nature of the act, as regards God, lie in regions above our comprehension; so that all speculations as to the person to whom the ransom was paid, and the reason why it was indispensable, have only led to centuries of mistaken theology. But the meaning and nature of it, as regards man, is our deliverance from bondage, and the payment of the debt which we had incurred (Titus 2:14; 1 Peter 1:18; Matthew 20:28; Romans 8:21-23). In all these cases, as Stanley well observes, the words have a double meaning - both of an inward act and of an outward result.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians1:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - As it is written. A compressed quotation from the Septuagint Version of Jeremiah 9:23, 24; 1 Samuel 2:10. Let him glory in the Lord. The word rendered \"glory\" is more literally, boast. The reference is to Jeremiah 9:23, 24; 1 Samuel 2:10 (LXX.). The prevalence of \"boasting\" among the Corinthians and their teachers drove St. Paul to dwell much on this word - from which he so greatly shrinks - in 2 Corinthians 10:12. (where the word occurs twenty times), and to insist that the only true object in which a Christian can glory is the cross (Galatians 6:14), not in himself, or in the world, or in men.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - St. Paul's own method. Verse 1. - And I; \"I too;\" I in accordance with God's method. When I came to you. The date of his first visit was in A.D. , and he had stayed a year and a half (Acts 18:11). He had since been (roughly speaking) \"three years\" (τριετίαν, Acts 20:31) at Ephesus. Of speech or of wisdom. I spoke to you neither oratorically nor philosophically. Hence the Apollos party, fond of the brilliant rhetoric of the young Alexandrian, spoke of Paul's speech as \"contemptible\" (2 Corinthians 10:10).

The unadorned simplicity of my teaching was part of a fixed design. Not to know anything. Not, that is, to depend on any human knowledge. Of course, St. Paul neither means to set aside all human knowledge nor to disparage other Christian doer, toes. His words must not be pressed out of their due context and proportion. Jesus Christ, and him crucified. Christ, in the lowest depth of his abasement and self sacrifice. He would \"know\" nothing else; that is, he would make this the central point and essence of all his knowledge, because he knew the \"excellency\" of this knowledge (Philippians 3:8) - knew it as the only knowledge which rose to the height of wisdom. Christ is the only Foundation (1 Corinthians 3:11). In the person and the work of Christ is involved the whole gospel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I was with you; literally, I became or proved myself, towards you, as in 1 Corinthians 16:10. In weakness. St. Paul was physically weak and liable also to nervous weakness and depression (1 Corinthians 4:7-12; Galatians 4:13; 2 Corinthians 10:1, 10; 2 Corinthians 12:7, 10). He shows an occasional self distrust rising from the consciousness of personal infirmities. This enhances our sense of his heroic courage and endurance. Doubtless this physical weakness and nervous depression were connected with his \"stake in the flesh,\" which seems to have been an acute and distressing form of ophthalmia, accompanied with cerebral disturbance (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:215-221). In fear, and in much trembling. Probably the words are even literally true, though they are a common phrase (2 Corinthians 7:15; Philippians 2:12, 13; Ephesians 6:5). It must be remembered that in his first visit to Corinth St. Paul had gone through stormy and troubled days (Acts 18:1-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My speech and my preaching; the form and matter of my discourse. He would not attempt to use the keen sword of philosophical dialectics or human eloquence, but would only use the weapon of the cross. Was not with enticing words of man's wisdom; rather, with persuasive words of wisdom (the word anthropines is a gloss). This simplicity was the more remarkable because \"Corinthian words\" was a proverb for choice, elaborate, and glittering phrases (Wetstein). It is not improbable that the almost total and deeply discouraging want of success of St. Paul in preaching at Athens had impressed him mere strongly with the uselessness of attempting to fight Greek philosophers with their own blunt and imperfect weapons. In demonstration of the Spirit and of power. So he says to the Thessalonians,\" Our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.\" The plain facts, so repellent to the natural intellect, were driven home with matchless force by spiritual conviction. The only heathen critic who has mentioned St. Paul's method is Longinus, the author of the treatise on 'The Sublime and Beautiful,' who calls him \"a master of unproved dogma,\" meaning apparently that his force lay in the irresistible statement of the facts which he came to preach.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In the power of God.

Verse 6. - Howbeit. In this passage he shows that in reality a crushing irony lay in his description of the gospel as being, in the world's judgment, \"weak\" and \"foolish.\" It was the highest wisdom, but it could only be understood by the perfect. Its apparent folly to the Corinthians was a proof of their blindness and incapacity. Among the perfect. The word either meansNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the mature, the full grown, as opposed to babes in Christ (1 Corinthians 3:1); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the fully initiated into the mysteries of godliness (ἐποπται 2 Peter 1:16). A wisdom not of this world; literally, of this seen. The word kosmos means the world in its material aspect; aeon is read for the world in its moral and intellectual aspect. \"The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:19). Nor of the rulers of this world. Some have taken these \"rulers\" to be the same as \"the world rulers of this darkness,\" i.e. the evil spirits, in Ephesians 6:12 (John 13:27; Luke 22:53). Ignatius (?) seems to have understood it thus; for he adopted the strange notion that \"the prince of this aeon\" (i.e. Satan) had been deceived and frustrated by the incarnation from a virgin, and the death on the cross (Ignat., 'Ad. Ephesians,' 19). It means more probably \"wisdom,\" as understood by Roman governors and Jewish Sanhedrists, who treated the Divine wisdom of the gospel with sovereign contempt (Acts 4:27). That [who] come to nought; literally, who are being done away with. Amid all the feebleness of the infant Church, St. Paul saw empires vanishing before it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In a mystery; that is, \"in a truth, once hidden, now revealed.\" The word is now used for what is dark and incomprehensible, but it has no such meaning in the New Testament, where it means \"what was once secret, but has now been made manifest\" (Romans 16:25; Ephesians 3:4, 9; Colossians 1:26; 1 Timothy 3:16). It implies the very reverse of any esoteric teaching. Hidden. It was \"hidden from the wise and prudent, but revealed to babes\" (Matthew 11:25). Before the worlds; literally, before the ages; before time began. Unto our glory. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews clearly states that \"the future age\" is in God's counsels subjected, not to the angels, but to man. But \"our glory\" is that we are \"called to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus\" (1 Peter 5:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Had they known it; literally, had they recognized; had they got to know it. The apostles often dwell on this ignorance as being in part a palliation for the sin of rejecting Christ (see especially Acts 3:17; Acts 13:27; comp. Isaiah 2:1). Jews and Romans, emperors, procurators: high priests, Pharisees, had in their ignorance conspired in vain to prevent what God had foreordained. The Lord of glory. This is not a mere equivalent of \"the glorious Lord,\" in Psalm 24:10. It is \"the Lord of the glory,\" i.e. \"the Lord of the Shechinah\" (comp. Ephesians 1:17, \"the Father of the glory \"). The Shechinah was the name given by the Jews to the cloud of light which symbolized God's presence. The cherubim are called, in Hebrews 9:5, \"cherubim of glory,\" because the Shechinah was borne on their outspread wings (see, however, Acts 7:2; Ephesians 1:17). There would have been to ancient ears a startling and awful paradox in the words \"crucified the Lord of glory.\" The words brought into juxtaposition the lowest ignominy and the most splendid exaltation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But as it is written. The whole sentence in the Greek is unfinished. The thought seems to be, \"But God has revealed to us things which eye hath not seen, etc., though the princes of this world were ignorant of them.\" Scriptural quotations are often thus introduced, apart from the general grammar of the sentence, as in the Greek of 1 Corinthians 1:31. Eye hath not seen, etc. The Revised Version is here more literal and accurate. The quotation as it stands is not found in the Old Testament. It most resembles Isaiah 64:4, but also vaguely resembles Isaiah 53:15; 65:17. It may be another instance of a loose general reminiscence (comp. 1 Corinthians 14:21; Romans 9:33). \"Non verbum e verbo expressit,\" says St. Jerome, \"sed παραφραστικῶς ευνδεμ σενσυμ aliis sermonibus indicavit.\" St. Chrysostom regards the words as part of a lost prophecy. Origen, Zacharias of Chrysopolis, and others say that the words occurred in an apocryphal book, the 'Apocalypse of Elias,' but if so the apocryphal writer must have had the passage of Isaiah in his mind. Some regard the words as a fragment of some ancient liturgy. Origen thought that they came from the 'Revelation of Elijah.' They were also to be found in the 'Ascension of Isaiah' (Jerome on Isaiah 64:4). and they occur in the Talmud (Sanhedr. 99 a). In a curious fragment of Hegesippus (circ. A.D. 150) preserved in Photius (Cod. 232.), that old writer indignantly repudiates this passage, saying that it is futile and \"utterly belies (καταψεύδεσθαι) the Holy Scriptures and the Lord, who says, 'Blessed are your eyes which see, and your ears which hear.'\" Photius cannot understand why (ὅτι καὶ παθὼν) Hegesippus should speak thus. Routh ('Rel. Sacr.,' 253) hardly knows how to excuse him; but perhaps if we had the context of the fragment we should see that he is attacking, not the words themselves, but some perversion of them by heretics, like the Docetae. The phrase, \"As it is written,\" decisively marks an intention to refer to Scripture. Neither have entered into the heart of man; literally, things which have not set foot upon the heart. The general thought is that God's revelations (for the immediate reference is to these, and not to future bliss) pass all understanding. The quotation of these words as referring to heaven is one of the numberless instances of texts inaccurately applied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But God hath revealed them unto us. They are secret no longer, but are \"mysteries which now it is given us to know\" (Matthew 13:11). By his Spirit. The Spirit guides into all truth (John 13:16). In ch. 12:8-11 St. Paul attributes every gift of wisdom directly to him. Searcheth. \"How unsearchable are his judgments!\" (Romans 11:33). Yea, the deep things of God. This expression, \"The depths of God,\" passed into the cant expression of the Gnostics, and it may be with reference to their misuse of it that St. John uses the phrase, \"The depths of Satan\" (Revelation 2:24). \"Oh, the depth,\" etc.! (Romans 11:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The things of God none knoweth. Some manuscripts have not the same word (οῖδεν) as that rendered \"knoweth\" in the earlier clause, but \"hath learnt\" (ἔγνωκεν); comp. John 21:17; 2 Corinthians 5:16. All that is meant is that our knowledge of God must always be relative, not absolute. It is not possible to measure the arm of God with the finger of man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The spirit of the world. The heathen world in its heathen aspect is regarded as under the power of the devil (2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 6:11, 12). Freely given to us by God. The word \"freely\" is here involved in the verb (χαρισθέντα) \"graciously bestowed.\" It is different from the phrase used in \"Freely ye have received,\" which is gratuitously (δωρεὰν, Matthew 10:8). All God's gifts are \"without money and without price\" (Isaiah 55:1), and not \"to be bought with money\" (Acts 18:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Comparing spiritual things with spiritual. The meaning of this clause is very uncertain. It has been rendered, \"Blending spiritual things with spiritual\" (Kling, Wordsworth), i.e. not adulterating them with carnal admixtures (2 Corinthians 2:17; 1 Peter 2:22). \"Interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men\" (Bengel, Reichert, Stanley, margin of Revised Version; see Genesis 40:8; Daniel 5:12, LXX.). \"Explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.\" This meaning the Greek will not bear, but Calvin and Beza get the same meaning by rendering it, \"Adapting spiritual things to spiritual words.\" It is doubtful whether the Greek verb (sunkrinontes) can be rendered \"comparing,\" which comes from the Vulgate, comparantes. Wickliffe has the version, \"Maken a liknesse of spyritual things to goostli men, for a besteli man persuyved not through thingis.\" The commonest sense of the word in the LXX. is \"interpreting\" (Genesis 40:8, etc.), and the best rendering is, \"Explaining spirituals to spiritual men.\" If it be supposed that the verb συγκρίνω acquired the sense of \"comparing\" in Hellenistic Greek (2 Corinthians 10:12; Wisd. 7:29 Wisd. 15:18), then the rendering of our Authorized Version may stand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The natural man. The Greek word is ψυχικὸς (psychical); literally, soulish, i.e. the man who lives the mere life of his lower understanding, the unspiritual, sensuous, and egoistic man. He may be superior to the fleshly, sensual, or carnal man, who lives only the life of the body (σωματικὸς); but is far below the spiritual man (πνευματικός). St. Paul (1 Thessalonians 5:23) recognizes the tripartite nature of man - body, soul, spirit. Receiveth not; i.e. \"does not choose to accept.\" He judges them by the foregone conclusions of his own prejudice. Because they are spiritually judged. The organ for the recognition of such truths - namely, the spirit - has become paralyzed or fallen into atrophy, from neglect; therefore the egoist and the sensualist have lost the faculty whereby alone spiritual truth is discernible. It becomes to them what painting is to the blind, or music to the deaf. This elementary truth is again and again insisted on in Scripture, and ignored by sceptics (Romans 8:6, 7; John 3:3; John 6:44, 45; John 14:17; 2 Corinthians 4:3-6). This verse is sometimes used to depreciate knowledge, reason, and intellect. On that abuse of the passage, see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3. 8:4-11, an admirable passage, which Bishop Wordsworth quotes at length. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that if God has no need of human knowledge, he has still less need of human ignorance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Judgeth all things. If he can judge the higher, lie can of course judge the lower. Being spiritual, he becomes intellectual also, as well as more than intellectual. He can see into the difference between the dream and the reality; he can no longer take the shadow for the substance. He can not only decide about ordinary matters, but can also \"discriminate the transcendent,\" i.e. see that which is best even in different alternatives of good. \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him\" (Psalm 25:14). He himself is judged of no man. He may be judged, condemned, depreciated, slandered every day of his life, but the arrow flights of human judgment fall far short of him. These Corinthians were judging and comparing Paul and Apollos and Cephas; but their judgments were false and worthless, and Paul told them that it was less than nothing to him to be judged by them or by man's feeble transitory day (1 Corinthians 4:3). \"Evil men,\" as Solomon said, \"understand not judgment\" (Proverbs 28:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Who hath known the mind of the Lord? \"The Lord\" is Jehovah (see Isaiah 40:13, LXX.; Romans 11:34). This is the reason why no one can judge the spiritual man in his spiritual life. To do so is like judging God. We have the mind of Christ. So Christ himself had told the apostles (John 15:15); and St. Paul always claimed to have been taught by direct revelation from Christ (Galatians 1:11, 12). They had the Spirit of Christ (Romans 8:9), and therefore the mind of Christ.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - The carnal conceit of the spiritually immature. Verse 1. - I... could not speak unto you as unto spiritual. Though softened by the word brethren, there was a crushing irony of reproof in these words: \"You thought yourselves quite above the need of my simple teaching. You were looking down on me from the whole height of your inferiority. The elementary character of my doctrine was after all the necessary consequence of your own incapacity for anything more profound.\" As unto carnal. The true reading here is sarkinois, fleshen, not sarkikois, fleshly, or carnal; the later and severer word is perhaps first used in ver. 3. The word sarkinos (earneus), fleshen, implies earthliness and weakness and the absence of spirituality; but sarki-kos (carnalis) involves the dominance of the lower nature and antagonism to the spiritual. As mite babes in Christ. The word \"babes\" has a good and a bad sense. In its good sense it implies humility and teachableness, as in 1 Corinthians 14:20, \"In malice be ye babes;\" and in 1 Peter 2:2, \"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word;\" and in Matthew 11:25. Here it is used in its bad sense of spiritual childishness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I fed you with milk. The metaphor is expanded in Hebrews 5:13, \"Every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the Word of righteousness; for he is a babe.\" The same metaphor is found in Philo; and the young pupils of the rabbis were called \"sucklings\" (תינוקות) and \"little ones\" (camp. Matthew 10:42). Not with meat; not with solid food, which is for full grown or spiritually perfect men (Hebrews 5:14). For hitherto; rather, for ye were not yet - when I preached to you - able to bear it. The same phrase is used by our Lord in John 16:12, \"I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now;\" and he taught them in parables, \"as they were able to bear it\" (Mark 4:33). Not even now are ye able. Though you imagine that you have advanced so far beyond my simpler teaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For ye are yet carnal. This is the reason for the spiritual dulness which your pride prevents you from recognizing. Envying, and strife, and divisions. The two latter words are omitted in some of the best manuscripts, and may have been added from Galatians 5:20. Partisanship and discord, the sins of the Corinthians - sins which have disgraced so many ages of Church history - are works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19), and involve many other sins (James 3:16), and are therefore sure proofs of the carnal mind, though they are usually accompanied by a boast of superior spiritual enlightenment. As men; that is, \"as men, not as Christians.\" To walk as a mere ordinary human being is not to \"walk in the Spirit\" (Galatians 5:25); comp.,\" I speak as a man\" (Romans 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For when one saith, I am of Paul. This is a proof that there were jealousies and partisanships among them. We again notice the generous courage of St. Paul in rebuking first those adherents who turned his own name into a party watchword. Are ye not carnal? The true reading is, \"Are ye not men?\" (א, A, B, C, and so the Revised Version); i.e. Are ye not swayed by mere human passions? The Spirit which you received at baptism ought to have lifted you above these mean rivalries. You ought to be something more than mere men. Religious partisanship is, in the eye of St. Paul, simply irreligious. He sets down party controversies as a distinct proof of carnality. Those who indulge in it are men devoid of the spiritual element.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-15. - The one foundation and the diverse superstructure.

The same word as that rendered \"deacons\" (diakonoi); \"ministers of Christ on your behalf\" (Colossians 1:7). Through whom ye believed. Through whom,\" not \"in whom\" (Bengel). They were merely the instruments of your conversion. In the second Epistle (2 Corinthians 3:3) he calls them \"the epistle of Christ ministered by us written... with the Spirit of the living God.\" As the Lord gave to him.

St. Paul everywhere recognized that his gift lay pre eminently in the ability to found Churches (comp. Acts 18:1-11; 1 Corinthians 4:15; 1 Corinthians 9:1; 1 Corinthians 15:1). Apollos watered. If, as is now generally believed, Apollos wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews, we see how striking was his power of strengthening the faith of wavering Churches. Eloquence and a deep insight into the meaning of Scripture, enriched by Alexandrian culture, seem to have been his special endowments (Acts 18:24, 27). The reference of the word \"watered\" to baptism by Augustine (Ep. 48) is one of the numberless instances of Scripture distorted by ecclesiasticism. God gave the increase (comp. 1 Corinthians 15:10; 2 Corinthians 3:5). The thought of every true teacher always is, \"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise\" (Psalm 115:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Anything. The planter and the waterer are nothing by comparison. They could do nothing without Christ's aid (John 15:16), and were nothing in themselves (2 Corinthians 12:11). But God that giveth the increase. The human instruments are nothing, but God is everything, because, apart from him, no result would follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Are one; literally, one thing. God is the sole Agent; the teachers, so far from being able to pose as rival leaders, form but one instrument in God's hand. Their relative differences shrink into insignificance when the source and objects of their ministry are considered. His own reward... his own labour. In the lower individual sphere the work of teachers shall be fairly estimated and rewarded as in the parable of the pounds and talents (comp. John 4:36; Revelation 22:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - God's fellow workers. Throughout the Bible we are taught that God requires the work of man, and that he will not help those who will do nothing for themselves or for him. The world was to be evangelized, not by sudden miracle, but by faithful human labour (Mark 16:20). God's husbandry; rather. God's field, or tilled land. The thought which he desires again and again to enforce is that they belong to God, not to the parties of human teachers. The word\" husbandry\" may also mean vineyard, and the metaphor is the same as in Isaiah 5:1; Isaiah 27:2; John 15:1; Matthew 13:3-30; Luke 13:6-9; Romans 11:16-24. God's building. This is one of St. Paul's favourite metaphors, as in vers. 16, 17; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Ephesians 2:20 - 22; Romans 15:20; 2 Timothy 2:19 (comp. 1 Peter 2:5; Revelation 21:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.

Here, again, we have St. Paul's baptismal aorist - his habit of regarding his whole spiritual life as potentially summed up in the one crisis of conversion and baptism. This phrase is a favourite one with him (1 Corinthians 15:10; Romans 15:15; Galatians 2:9; Ephesians 3:2). As a wise master builder. \"Wise\" only in the sense of subordinating every pretence of human wisdom to the will of God; and here the adjective only applies to the wisdom required by a builder. In other words, \"wise\" is here equivalent to \"skilful.\" Since Paul had received the grace of God for this very purpose, he was made \"wise\" by the knowledge of Christ (for the metaphor of building, see Matthew 7:24; Matthew 16:18; Ephesians 2:21; 1 Peter 2:5). The foundation; rather, a foundation. Though in truth there is but one foundation, as he proceeds to say, St. Paul always refused to build on the foundation laid by another (Romans 15:20). Another. Perhaps the special allusion is to Apollos.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Other foundation can no man lay. Any \"other\" gospel is not merely \"another,\" but \"a different\" gospel (Galatians 1:9). That which is laid; rather, that is lying (comp. 1 Peter 2:6). It has not been placed there (τεθέντα) by any human bands, but lies there by the eternal will. Which is Jesus Christ. \"The doctrine of Jesus Christ is the foundation of all theology; his person of all life.\" This is again and again inculcated in Scripture: Isaiah 28:16, \"Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation.\" On this rock the Church is built (Matthew 16:18: Acts 4:11, 12; Ephesians 2:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Gold, silver. Perhaps St. Paul thought for a moment of the gorgeous metals . rod rich marbles used in the Corinthian temples, as well as in the temple at Jerusalem. But it is surely fantastic to suggest that his reference is an historical reminiscence of the melting of gold and silver in the burning of Corinth by Mummius, nearly two hundred years before. Costly stones; i.e. costly marble from Paros, Phrygia, etc. Wood, hay, stubble. These words seem to symbolize erroneous or imperfect doctrines, which would not stand the test, and which led to evil practices. Such were the\" philosophy and vain deceit,\" \"the weak and beggarly dements,\" \"the rudiments of the world,\" of which he speaks in Galatians 4:9; Colossians 2:8. So in the Midrash Tehillin, the words of false teachers are compared to hay. The doctrines to which he alludes are not and christian, but imperfect and human - such, for instance, as, \"Humanas constitutiunculas de cultu, de victo, de frigidis ceremoniis\" (Erasmus).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Each man's work shall be made manifest. The real nature - the worth or worthlessness - of each man's work, will be made clear sooner or later. The day shall declare it. \"The day\" can only mean \"the day of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (1 Corinthians 1:8), which would specially \"make manifest the counsels of the hearts\" (1 Corinthians 4:5), and \"judge the secrets of men\" (Romans 2:16), and make all men manifest \"before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 4:10). It shall be revealed by fire; rather, because it is being revealed in fire. The phrase \"is being\" is called bad English, but some such phrase is positively needed to render the continuous present tense, which here expresses certainty, natural sequence, perpetual imminence. This tense is constantly used to express the continuity and the present working of Divine laws (comp. Matthew 3:10). As the nominative is not expressed, it is uncertain whether \"it\" refers to \"each man's work\" or to\" the day.\" Either gives an apposite sense (Malachi 4:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:8). Some would make \"he\" (namely, Christ) the nominative, because \"the day\" means \"the day of Christ;\" and in favour of this view they quote 2 Thessalonians 1:7, \"The revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven in flaming fire.\" But the ellipse of an unexpressed nominative is harsh. The fire itself shall prove each man's work. This is the \"probatory\" or testing fire of the day of the Lord, of which we read very frequently in the Fathers. The doctrine of purgatory has been in some measure founded on this verse (Council of Florence, A.D. 1439); but such a view of it cannot be maintained. The reader will find the subject examined and the quotations from the Fathers given in the writer's 'Mercy and Judgment,' p. 69. All that is said here is that the fire of Christ's presence - the consuming fire of God's love - shall test the work, not purge it. The fire is probatory, not purgatorial, and it is not in itself a fife of wrath, for it tests the gold and silver as well as the inferior elements of the structure. It is the fire of the refiner, not of the avenger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If any man's work shall abide. St. Paul is speaking primarily of teachers, though, of course, his words apply by analogy to all believers. He shall receive a reward. One of the teacher's rewards will be his converts (1 Thessalonians 2:19), who will be \"his joy and crown of glorying\" (Philippians 2:16); another will be \"a crown of glory that fadeth not away\" (1 Peter 5:2, 4; Daniel 12:3); yet another will be fresh opportunities for higher labour (Matthew 25:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He shall suffer loss. He shall not receive the full reward to which he might otherwise look (2 John 1:8). He himself shall be saved. It is an inexpressible source of comfort to us, amid the weakness and ignorance of our lives, to know that if we have only erred through human frailty and feebleness, while yet we desired to be sincere and faithful, the work will be burnt, yet the workman will be saved. Some of the Fathers gave to this beautiful verse the shockingly perverted meaning that \"the workman would be preserved alive for endless torments,\" \"salted with fire\" in order to endure interminable agonies. The meaning is impossible, for it reverses the sense of the word \"saved;\" and makes it equivalent to \"damned;\" but the interpretation is an awful proof of the distortions to which a merciless human rigorism and a hard, self styled orthodoxy have sometimes subjected the Word of God. Yet so as by fire; rather, through or by means of fire (διὰ πυρός). We may be, as it were, \"snatched as a brand from the burning\" (Zechariah 3:2; Amos 4:11; Jude 1:23), and \"scarcely\" saved (1 Peter 4:18). Similarly it is said in 1 Peter 3:20 that Noah was saved \"through water\" (δι ὕδατος). The ship is lost, the sailor saved; the workman is saved, the work is burned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-23. - The peril and folly of glorying in men. Verse 16. - Know ye not. The phrase is used by St. Paul in this Epistle to emphasize important truths, as in 1 Corinthians 5:6; 1 Corinthians 6:2,.9, 15; 9:13, 24. Out of this Epistle it only occurs in Romans 6:16; Romans 11:2. That ye are the temple of God. \"Ye,\" both collectively (Ephesians 2:21) and individually; \"God's shrine;\" not built for men's glory. The word \"temple\" in the Old Testament always means the material temple; in the Gospels our Lord \"spake of the temple of his body;\" in the rest of the New Testament the body of every baptized Christian is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 6:16), because \"God dwelleth in him\" (1 John 4:16; comp. John 14:23). In another aspect Christians can be regarded as \"living stones in one spiritual house\" (1 Peter 2:5). The temple; rather, the shrine (uses) wherein God dwells (naiei), and which is the holiest part of the temple (hieron).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - If any man defile the temple of God. The verb is the same as in the next clause, and should be rendered, If any man destroy the temple of God; but the word is perhaps too strong, and the word \"mar\" or \"injure\" might better convey the meaning (Olshausen). The two verbs are brought into vivid juxtaposition in the original: \"God shall ruin the ruiner of his temple.\" St. Paul was, perhaps, thinking of the penalty of death attached to any one who desecrated the temple of Jerusalem. Inscriptions on the chel, or \"middle wall of partition,\" threatened death to any Gentile who set foot within the sacred enclosure.\" Which temple ye are; literally, the which are ye; i.e. ye are holy. St. Paul is here referring to the Church of Corinth, and to the false teachers who desecrated it by bringing in \"factions of destruction\" (2 Peter 2:1). Ideally the Church was glorious, \"not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing\" (Ephesians 5:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Let no man deceive himself. Like the other formula, \"Be not deceived\" (1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Corinthians 15:33; Galatians 6:7); \"Deceive not yourselves\" (Jeremiah 37:9); \"Let no man deceive you\" (Marl 24:4; Luke 21:8; 2 Thessalonians 2:3; Ephesians 5:6; 1 John 3:7). We are so liable to self deception (1 John 1:8; Galatians 6:3), as well as to being deceived by others (2 Timothy 3:13), that there was need to repeat this warning incessantly. Seemeth to be wise; rather, thinketh that he is wise. He is referring specially to the Apollos party, who vaunted their esoteric knowledge, and so were \"wise in their own eyes, prudent in their own conceits\" (Isaiah 5:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The wisdom of this world. Here the word for \"world\" is kosmos, in the last verse it was alert. Kosmos is the world regarded objectively; aion the world regarded in its moral and intellectual aspect. He that taketh the wise in their craftiness. This is one of the few references to the Book of Job in the New Testament. It comes from the speech of Eliphaz in Job 5:13, but St. Paul substitutes the words \"clutching\" (drassomenos) and \"craftiness\" (panourgia) for the milder katalabon and phronesei of the LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Lord knoweth, etc. A quotation from Psalm 94:11. St. Paul substitutes \"the wise\" for the \"men\" of the original, because the psalmist is referring to perverse despisers of God. Dialogismoi is rather \"reasonings\" than \"thoughts.\" It is used in a disparaging sense, as in Romans 1:21; Ephesians 4:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Wherefore. St. Paul, with this word, concludes the argument of warning of the previous section, as in 1 Corinthians 3:7; 1 Corinthians 4:5; 8:38; 11:33; 14:39; 15:58 (Wordsworth). All things are yours. It is always a tendency of Christians to underrate the grandeur of their privileges by exaggerating their supposed monopoly of some of them, while many equally rich advantages are at their disposal. Instead of becoming partisans of special teachers, and champions of separate doctrines, they might enjoy all that was good in the doctrine of all teachers, whether they were prophets, or pastors, or evangelists (Ephesians 4:11, 12). The true God gives us all things richly to enjoy (1 Timothy 6:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas. All were their servants for Jesus' sake (2 Corinthians 4:5). Instead of becoming partisans of either, they could enjoy the greatness of all. Or the world. The sudden leap from Cephas to the world shows, as Bengel says, the impetuous leap of thought. There is a passage of similar eloquence in Romans 8:38, 39. The \"hundredfold\" is promised even in this world (Mark 10:29, 30). Or life. Because life in Christ is the only real life, and Christ came that we might have life, and have it more abundantly (see Romans 8:38). Or death. To the Christian, \"to live is Christ, and to die is gain\" (Philippians 1:21). So that death is no more thanNEWLINENEWLINE\"The lifting of a latch;NEWLINENought but a step into the open airNEWLINEOut of a tent already luminousNEWLINEWith light which shines through its transparent folds.\" Or things present, or things to come. \"He that overcometh shall inherit all things\" (Revelation 21:7), because Christ has received all things from the Father.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And ye are Christ's (see 1 Corinthians 6:19; 1 Corinthians 15:23; Romans 14:8; Galatians 3:29). Christians possess because they are possessed by Christ (Meyer). Christ is our Master, and God our Father (Matthew 23:10). And Christ is God's; because \"Christ is equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, but inferior to the Father as touching his manhood.\" Hence in 1 Corinthians 11:3 he says, \"The head of Christ is God;\" and in 1 Corinthians 15:28, we read of Christ resigning his mediatorial kingdom, that God may be all in all. Perhaps St. Paul implies the thought that Christ belongs, not to a party, but to God, the Father of us all. But the ultimate climax from Christ to God is found also in 1 Corinthians 4:1: Romans 15:5, etc.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - Judgments, human and Divine, respecting ministers. Verse 1. - Let a man so account of us. Since it is inevitable that Christians should form some estimate of the position of their ministers, he proceeds to tell them what that estimate should be. Ministers are not to be unduly magnified, for their position is subordinate; they are not to be unduly depreciated, for if they are faithful they may appeal from frivolous human prejudices and careless depreciations to that only Judge and Master before whom they stand or fall. Ministers; here huperetas; in 1 Corinthians 3:5 diakonous. They are huperetai (in its derivation \"under rowers\") in their relation to Christ; diakonoi in their relation to men. Of Christ; and therefore responsible to Him. Stewards; dispensers, subordinate distributors. These \"agents\" were higher slaves (Luke 16:1-8). Of the mysteries of God. The word \"mysteries\" means truths once hidden but now revealed; as in Luke 8:10, \"Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God.\" In later patristic usage the word means \"sacraments;\" but St. Paul has expressly said (1 Corinthians 1:17) that his mission was to preach the gospel, not primarily to administer the sacraments. (For descriptions of the work of a minister according to St. Paul's lofty ideal, see the pastoral Epistles, and 1 Thessalonians 2:7-11; Colossians 1:25-29; Acts 20:18-21, 24-28. St. Peter's is given in 1 Peter 4:10, 11; 1 Peter 5:2-4.) A minister is not to be estimated as a supernatural teacher, or a civil autocrat, or an infallible critic, but as an ambassador from Christ, who reveals to the \"initiated\" that which they could not otherwise know.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Moreover. The true reading (א, A, B, C, D, F) is ω΅δε κοιπὸν, here, moreover; i.e. \"on this earth.\" It may be required of him as a minister that he should be faithful, but if, being faithful, he is misjudged and depreciated, his appeal lies to a truer and loftier tribunal. It is required. This is the reading of א, A, C, D. Other manuscripts have \"ye require;\" but the sound of the two words in Hellenistic Greek would have been almost indistinguishable. That a man be found faithful. We have a right to demand that on trial he be proved to be honest and diligent. So our Lord has described the \"faithful and wise steward\" in Luke 12:42, 43. What is required of ministers is neither brilliancy, nor eloquence, nor profound knowledge, nor success, but only - fidelity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But. The Corinthians might have expected that the conclusion of St. Paul's remarks would be a recognition of their right to sit in judgment on his faithfulness; but it is, on the contrary, an expression of his complete indifference to their shallow and unfair estimate, and an appeal to the approval of his own conscience and to the judgment of the Lord. It is a very small thing; literally, it is for the least. That I should be judged of you; rather, that I should be examined by you (anakritho). Technically the word anakrisis means \"an examination preliminary to trial.\" Or of man's judgment; literally, of man's day. The brief day of human life is bounded by too narrow an horizon for accurate judgments. Many of the greatest and best men have felt, like Lord Bacon, that they must leave to other generations the right estimate of their characters, views, and actions. St. Jerome reckons the expression \"day\" for \"judgment\" among the \"Cilicisms\" of St. Paul (Jeremiah, 'Ad Algas.,' 10), i.e. the expressions due to his early training in Cilicia. More probably (as Grotius thinks) there is a reference to the \"day\" fixed for earthly trials (diem dicere, equivalent to \"to impeach\"), and to the phrase \"the day of judgment\" - \"the woeful day\" of Jeremiah 17:16. The word \"day\" in all languages and idioms signifies \"judgment\" (Hammond). From dies, a day, comes the phrase \"a diet.\" A \"daysman\" means an arbitrator. Yea, I judge not mine own self. Here, as in the previous clause and in 1 Corinthians 6:4, the verb is not krino, I judge, but anakrino, I examine. Thus the verse discourages all morbid self introspection. It also shows that St. Paul is not arrogantly proclaiming himself superior to the opinion of the Corinthians, but is pointing out the necessary inadequacy of all human judgments. The heart is too liable to self deceit (Jeremiah 17:9, 10) to enable it to pronounce a judgment with unerring accuracy. Hence neither a man's contemporaries nor the man himself can form any final estimate of him or of his fitting position, because their knowledge is too imperfect. History often reverses the decision of contemporaries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I know nothing by myself; rather, nothing against myself. The phrase of the Authorized Version originally meant this, but is now obsolete in this sense. \"I am sorry that each fault can be proved by the queen,\" says Cranmer to Henry VIII. It is like the Latin Nil conscire sibi. The same phrase occurs in the LXX. of Job 27:6. St. Paul says, \"The verdict of my own conscience acquits me of all intentional unfaithfulness;\" but this is insufficient, because God sees with clearer eyes than ours. \"Who can understand his errors?\" asks the psalmist (Psalm 19:12); and the \"secret faults\" against which he prays are not hidden vices, but sins of which he was himself unconscious. It must be remembered that St. Paul is here only speaking with conscious integrity of his ministerial work. Nothing could have been further from the mind of one who elsewhere calls himself\" the chief of sinners\" than to claim an absolute immunity from every form of self reproach. They who claim immaculate holiness can as little quote the sanction of St. Paul (1 Corinthians 9:27; 1 Corinthians 15:9; Ephesians 3:8; Philippians 3:13, etc.) as of any other saint. The confessions of the holiest are ever the most humble. Yet am I not hereby justified. Because \"every way of a man\" is apt to be \"right in his own eyes,\" but God pondereth the hearts, and therefore in God's sight \"no man living is justified.\" St. Paul is here using the word in its legal rather than its theological sense. He that judgeth me is the Lord. This is a reason for serious awe and deep self searching of heart (Psalm 130:3; Job 9:2). Yet also for hope and confidence when a man can, like the modern statesman, \"look from the storm without to the sunshine of an approving conscience within.\" For God, being \"greater than our hearts\" (1 John 3:21), may count \"the long 'yes' of life\" against the one \"no,\" or the single faithless minute. Knowing whereof we are made, remembering that we are but dust, he looks on usNEWLINENEWLINE\"With larger other eyes than ours,NEWLINETo make allowance for us all.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Judge nothing. St. Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans, insists with some indignation on this duty of checking the tendency to vain depreciation, both because we have not the capacity for forming adequate judgments, and because censoriousness is a very common though thoroughly unchristian vice (Romans 14:4, 10, 13). Before the time. The time is when God shall \"judge the secrets of men\" (Romans 2:16), and when \"the day shall try every man's work of what sort it is\" (1 Corinthians 3:13). Until the Lord come. The advent is called in the New Testament sometimes the \"epiphany,\" and sometimes the parousia of Christ. The word used for \"until\" (heos an) points to a time entirely indefinite. Both; rather, also; i.e. among other things. The hidden things of darkness. \"All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do\" (Hebrews 4:13; comp. Ecclesiastes 12:14). God \"shall illuminate the crypts of the darkness which naturally fills the self deceiving heart.\" The counsels of the hearts. These may bear no scrutiny, even when the actions of the life have been made to look plausible enough. And then. God only \"seeth in secret\" (Matthew 6:4), and therefore the praise and blame of men may in this life be equally unjust. Shall every man have praise of God; rather, each one shall then have his praise (i.e. such praise as he deserves) from God. Some of the Greek Fathers (e.g. Theophylact) here make \"praise\" a \"word of intermediate sense,\" involving either praise or blame. But St. Paul says \"praise\" for two reasons - partly because he is thinking of faithful teachers like Cephas, Apollos, and himself, who were depreciated by rival factions; and partly because he, like other apostles, shows an invariable tendency to allude to the bright rather than to the dark side of judgment. The \"praise from God\" - the \"Well done, good and faithful servant\" - is so infinitely precious that it reduces to insignificance the comparative value of human praise or blame.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-13. - Contrast between the inflated self sufficiency of the Corinthians and the earthly humiliation of the apostles. Verse 6. - Brethren. The occasional use of this and similar expressions (\"beloved,\" etc.) often serves to strengthen an appeal, or, as here, to soften the sternness of a rebuke. I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos. The meaning seems to be that St. Paul has prominently transferred to himself and to Apollos, or rather to the parties who chose their names as watchwords, the proof as to the sin and futility of partisanship which applied equally well to the parties which ranged themselves under other names. (For the verb \"transfer\" - more often \"transform\" see 2 Corinthians 11:13, 14, 15; Philippians 3:21.) He abstains purposely and generously from publicly naming the fuglemen of the antagonistic factions. For your sakes. By rebuking party spirit in his own partisans and those of the teacher who was most closely allied to himself, he robbed his remarks of all semblance of personality or bitterness. It showed his generous delicacy not to allude rather to the adherents of Cephas and the Judaean emissary. Than ye might learn in us. I made Apollos and myself instances of the undesirability of over exalting human teachers, that by our case you might learn the general principle. Not to think of men above that which is written. The true reading is merely, not above the things which have been written, as though the words were a sort of proverb, like Ne quid nimis or Milton's \"The rule of not too much\" (μηδὲν ἄγαν). The word \"to think\" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The phrase, \"which have been written,\" is of very uncertain meaning. It may refer generally to \"the scriptural rule\" that all boasting is wrong (Jeremiah 9:23), or to the humble estimate of teachers which he has just been writing down for them. All his Old Testament quotations so far (ch. 1:19, 31; 3:19) have referred to humility. Some see in it a reference to Matthew 23:8 \"Be not ye called Babbi;\" but it is uncertain whether St. Matthew's Gospel was yet written; and St. Paul never refers so directly to any written Gospel. Perhaps it is a sort of proverb,\" Keep always to strict evidence;\" \"Say nothing which cannot be proved in black and white.\" The text, like so many others, has only a very remote connection with the sense in which it is usually quoted. That no one of you he puffed up. St. Paul was painfully impressed by this inflation of the Corinthians, and he often recurs to this word as a description of their vain conceit (1 Corinthians 4:18, 19; 1 Corinthians 5:2; 1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 13:4; 2 Corinthians 12:20). In other Epistles the word is only found once (in Colossians 2:18). For one against another. The expression is a profound one. The glorying in men (1 Corinthians 3:21), undesirable in any circumstances, becomes the more pernicious because the exaltation of one set of teachers is almost invariably accompanied by mean and unjust depreciation of any who could be supposed to be their rivals. The Corinthian who was \"for Cephas\" would be almost certain to be, to some extent, \"against Paul.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Who maketh thee to differ? literally, Who distinguisheth thee? He means that this glorification and depreciation of rival views and rival teachers sprang from unwarrantable arrogance. It involved a claim to superiority, and a right to sit in judgment, which they did not possess. That thou didst not receive? Even supposing that you have some special gift, it is a gift, not a merit, and therefore it is a boon for which to be thankful, not a pre-eminence of which to boast.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Satan, I know thy power, and thou know'st mine,NEWLINENeither our own, but given.

There is a strong but healing irony in these expressions, and in the entire contrast between the comfortable, full fed, regal self satisfaction of the Corinthians, and the depression and scorn in the midst of which the apostles lived. The loving delicate irony is, in a different way, as effective as the stern denunciation of St. John: \"Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked\" (Revelation 3:17). St. Paul's satire is always akin to charity; it is never satire with no pity in it. Ye have reigned as kings. The word simply means \"ye reigned.\" Like the Stoics, so each little Corinthian sectarian regarded himself as a king. \"To reign\" was, however, a proverbial phrase (like the Latin vivo et regno) for being \"happy as a king.\" Without us (comp. Hebrews 11:40). The Corinthians were cultivated enough to appreciate the deep irony of the phrase, \"We poor apostles have become quite needless to you in your lordly independence.\" And I would to God ye did reign. The words \"to God\" should be omitted. The loving heart of St. Paul could never long keep up a strain of irony. He drops the satire, and passes on to impassioned and affectionate appeal. That we also might reign with you. If the exalted eminence which you now only enjoy in your own conceits had been but real, then we, whose \"hope, and joy, and crown of exultation you are in the presence of Christ\" (1 Thessalonians 2:19), should share the grandeur with you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For. This word shows how different was the reality. Hath set forth; displayed as on a stage (2 Thessalonians 2:4). Us the apostles. St. Paul identifies them with himself; but undoubtedly he had \"laboured more abundantly than they all.\" Last. Servants of all; in the lowest circumstances of humiliation (comp. Mark 9:35). The apostles. Not the twelve only, but those who might be called apostles in a wider sense, who shared the same afflictions (Hebrews 10:33). As it were appointed to death. This daily doom is referred to by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:30, 31; 2 Corinthians 4:11; Romans 8:36. Tertullian renders the word \"veluti bestiaries,\" like criminals condemned to the wild beasts ('De Pudicit.,' 14). But the day had not yet come when Christians were to hear so often the terrible cry, \"Christianos ad leones!\" A spectacle; literally, a theatre. The same metaphor is used in Hebrews 10:33. To angels. The word, when used without an epithet, always means good angels, who are here supposed to look down in sympathy (comp. Hebrews 12:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - We are fools for Christ's sake. The irony is softened by the intervening sentences, and as regards the apostles there is no irony. St. Paul was called \"a seed pecker\" (spermologos) by the Epicureans and Stoics at Athens, and Festus in full court called him \"mad.\" Ye are wise in Christ. He could not say as before, \"for Christ's sake;\" for even though he is using the language of irony, \"the pseudo wisdom of the Corinthians had other motives.\" We are weak. The consciousness of physical and personal weakness weighed heavily on the mind of St. Paul in moments of depression (2 Corinthians 10:10; 2 Corinthians 13:4). Ye are honourable, but we are despised; literally, ye are glorious, but we are dishonoured. The word \"dishonoured\" also means \"disfranchised.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Unto this present hour. In these three verses he draws a picture of the condition of the apostles, especially of the trials to which he was himself subjected, on which the best comment is in 2 Corinthians 11:23-27. This letter was written from Ephesus, where he had so much to do and to endure (Acts 20:31). Hunger and thirst. \"In hunger and thirst, in fastings often\" (2 Corinthians 11:27). Are naked (Matthew 25:36; James 2:15; and comp. 2 Corinthians 11:27). And are buffeted. The verb means literally, are slapped in the face (comp. 2 Corinthians 12:7). Such insults, together with scourgings, fell to the lot of St. Paul (Acts 23:2, etc.) and the other apostles (Acts 16:23, 1 Peter 2:20), as well as to that of their Lord (Matthew 26:57, etc.). It showed the utter contempt with which they were treated; for though St. Paul ought to have been exempt from such violence, both as a freeman and a Roman citizen, he was treated as vilely as if he had been a mere foreign slave. Have no certain dwelling place. This homelessness was among the severest of all trials (Matthew 8:20; Matthew 10:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Labour, working with our own hands. St. Paul supported himself by the dreary toil and scant earnings of a tent maker, in the express determination to be no burden upon his converts (Acts 18:3; Acts 20:34; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; 1 Corinthians 9:6; 2 Corinthians 11:7, etc.). Such conduct was the more noble because all mechanical trades were looked down upon by the Greeks as a sort of banausia. And though it was repellent and mechanical work to be handling the strong scented black goats' hair all day, yet by this labour he maintained not only himself but also his brother missionaries (Acts 20:34). Being reviled. The early Christians were falsely accused of the most execrable crimes, so that the very name \"Christian\" was regarded as equivalent to \"malefactor\" (1 Peter 4:14, 16). We bless. Herein they obeyed the direct precept of our Lord (Matthew 5:44), as well as his example (Luke 23:44; 1 Peter 2:23; 1 Peter 3:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeing defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Being defamed, we entreat. The expression \"we entreat\" is very general. It may mean \"we entreat men not to speak thus injuriously of us\" (Calvin); or \"we exhort them to do right.\" As the filth of the world. The Greek word katharmata has a technical sense, in which it means \"men devoted to death for purposes of expiation\" (homines piaculares). The word perikatharnmta has the sense of \"sin offerings\" in Proverbs 21:18; Tobit 5:18. It is, however, doubtful whether this meaning of the word could have been at all familiar to Greek readers, and it is only in a very general and distantly metaphorical sense that the sufferings of God's saints can be regarded as, in any sense of the word, vicarious. It is better, therefore, here to retain the sense of \"refuse\" (purgamenta, things vile and worthless). The offscouring of all things; perhaps rather, of all men. The word peripsema means \"a thing scraped off,\" and this word also was used in expiatory human sacrifices, where the formula used to victims thus flung into the sea, in times of plague or famine, was, \"Become our peripsema' ('Schol. on Ar.;' Plut., 456). Thus in Tobit (5:18), Anna the wife of Tobias says, \"Let the money be used as a peripsema for the child;\" and Ignatius uses the phrase, \"I am your peripsema.\" From this and the similar phrase in the Letter of Barnabas,\" I am the peripsema of your love,\" it seems to have become a current expression of tenderness among Christians, \"I am your peripsema.\" But in this case also it may be doubted whether the sacrificial idea was present in the apostle's mind. He is thinking of scenes which he had already faced and would have to face hereafter, when mobs shouted against him that he was \"a pestilent fellow\" (Acts 24:5) and not fit to live (Acts 22:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-21. - The practical steps which he intends to take with reference to these party divisions. Verse 14. - To shame you. Such seems to be the meaning of the word, for it is so used in the LXX. (compare the use of the verb in 2 Thessalonians 3:14; Titus 2:8; and of the substantive in 1 Corinthians 6:5; 1 Corinthians 15:34). I warn; rather, I admonish. St. Paul here gives the reason why he cannot write angrily or bitterly, even though he has used strong expostulation and keen irony. It is because he regards himself as their spiritual father (comp. 2 Corinthians 6:13; 2 Corinthians 12:14, 15; 1 Thessalonians 2:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Ten thousand; never so many. The word in Greek is used indefinitely, but here implies a touch of impatience at the itch of teaching which seems to have prevailed at Corinth. Tutors; rather, pedagogues, in a technical sense. We have no exact equivalent in English to the paidagogos, the slave who led boys to school. The word also occurs in Galatians 3:24, 25. The father loves most, and has the nearer and dearer claim. In Christ. So he says, \"The Law was our paidagogos to Christ.\" These guides or guardians were such \"in Christ,\" i.e. in the sphere of Christian life. Not many fathers. St. Paul felt a yearning desire that his unique claim as the founder of their Church should not be so ungratefully overlooked, as though it were of no importance (comp. 1 Corinthians 3:6; 1 Corinthians 9:1, 2; Acts 18:11). I have begotten you. The word is here only used in a secondary and metaphoric sense, as in Philemon 1:10; Galatians 4:19. In the highest sense we are only begotten by the will of God, by that Word of truth (James 1:18), to which he alludes in the words \"through the gospel.\" The \"second birth\" is, however a doctrine more dwelt on by St. John (John 3:3; 1 John 3:9; 1 John 5:1, etc.) than by St. Paul, who, as Mr. Beet observes, only refers to it in Titus 3:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Be ye followers; rather, imitators. He makes the same appeal in 1 Corinthians 11:1; Philippians 3:17. Of course, he only uses his human example as a guide to them in the special virtues of humility, self denial, and faithfulness (1 Peter 5:3; Hebrews 13:7). In the highest sense we can only be \"imitators of God\" (Ephesians 5:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For this cause. Because, as your spiritual father, I naturally take the deepest interest in your well being. Have I sent; rather, I sent. Timothy had started before this letter was despatched (Acts 19:22), but he did not reach Corinth till after its arrival, because he had been unable to go by sea, and had to travel round by Macedonia. St. Paul, on hearing the grave news from Corinth, seems to have countermanded him (1 Corinthians 16:10, \"If Timotheus come\"), but was uncertain whether the messenger would reach him in time. The necessity for despatching Titus had been more immediate. My beloved son, and faithful in the Lord; rather, who is my beloved and faithful child (teknon) in the Lord. St. Paul had converted him, and felt towards him all the love of a father (1 Timothy 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 3:2; Philippians 2:20-22). Shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ. The expression shows all St. Paul's delicacy. He is not sending the youthful Timothy as an authoritative teacher, since the Corinthians, fond of high pretension and soaring oratory, might scorn to show any submission to a shy and shrinking youth; but he is only sending him because, as his closest companion, Timothy would be best able to explain to them his plans and wishes in the organization of Churches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Are puffed up; rather, were puffed up; at the time that they made these disparaging comparisons of me with others. As though I would not come to you; rather, as though I were not coming to you. St. Paul was on the eve of starting for Macedonia on his way to visit them (1 Corinthians 16:5), but, owing to the grievous state of the Church, he subsequently changed his purpose (2 Corinthians 1:15, 23). When he left them he had promised to return, \"if God wilt\" (Acts 18:21). His many enemies and critics were likely to say, \"He is afraid to come himself, and so he sends Timothy.\" They flattered themselves that he was alarmed by their culture and intellectualism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I will come to you shortly (Philippians 2:24; 2 Timothy 4:9). He came soon after writing the Second Epistle. At this time he was preparing to leave Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:8); his actual departure was precipitated by the tumult (Acts 20. l, 2). If the Lord will. The apostolic use of the phrase was something more than a mere form (Romans 15:32; Hebrews 6:3; James 4:15); it expressed a real and humble spirit of dependence. Not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. He will use his gift of spiritual discernment to discover whether the haughty self assertion and sounding phraseology of these inflated partisans would not collapse when confronted with real authority. The \"speech\" was there in abundance; but was there anything genuine, any real spiritual force, behind it?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The kingdom of God. The Christian life, with all its attainments and all its hopes. Is not in word, but in power. It is not a matter of profession, or of eloquence, or of phrases, but of transforming efficacy. St. Paul always appeals for the corroboration of his authority to the signs and power of the Spirit (2 Corinthians 10:45; Romans 15:19; 1 Thessalonians 1:5), to the \"demonstration\" of which he has already referred (1 Corinthians 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - What will ye? \"The whole thing lies with you\" (Chrysostom). With a rod; literally, in a rod a not uncommon Greek phrase. The meaning of this expression is best seen from 2 Corinthians 10:2; 2 Corinthians 13:10. In love. He would come to them \"in love\" in any case; but if they now rejected his appeals the love would be compelled to manifest itself in sharpness and stern deeds. In the spirit of meekness. Meyer here gives to the word \"spirit\" the sense of \"the Holy Spirit,\" as in John 15:26; 2 Corinthians 4:13; but the simpler sense of the term is almost certainly the true one.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - Excommunication of an incestuous offender. Verse 1. - It is reported. The abruptness with which the subject is introduced shows the intensity of St. Paul's feelings, and his indignation that he should have been left to hear of this crime by common report. The news had come to him \"from those of Chloe's household.\" But St. Paul was not acting on mere \"report.\" The Greek phrase implies, \"It is notorious that there is uncleanness among you.\" St. Paul must have felt it to be a bad feature in the character of the Corinthian Church that they had not mentioned this gross scandal in their letter. Commonly; rather, actually or absolutely; Elsewhere in the New Testament the worn only occurs in Matthew 5:24; 1 Corinthians 6:7; 1 Corinthians 15:29. Tertullian renders it \"in totum.\" St. Paul has no need in this instance to name his informants. Every one knew of this scandal. Fornication; a general word for all kinds of impurity. And. The word involves an indignant climax, \"Yes, and uncleanness of such a kind that,\" etc. Is not so much as named. The true reading is, does not even exist. This form of incest was, indeed, \"named\" among the Gentiles, for it forms the basis of the story of Hippolytus, the scene of which was in the neighbourhood of Corinth; but the feelings even of pagans were so shocked by it that Cicero alludes to such a crime in the words, \"Oh, incredible wickedness, and except in this woman's case - unheard of in all experience!\" ('Pro Cluent.,' 5). At this very epoch Nero deepened the general execration against himself by the generally accepted suspicion that he had been guilty of a yet more flagrant crime. Should have; rather, that a certain person has his father's wife. Apparently this was some nominal Christian, who was living in open sin with his stepmother, and thereby braving the curse of Leviticus 18:17; Deuteronomy 27:20. We gather from 2 Corinthians 7:12 that the father was living, and had also joined the Christian community. From the complete silence as to the crime of the woman, it must be inferred that she was a heathen. Whether she had been divorced or not does not appear, nor whether the offender was nominally married to her or not. His father's wife. He might have used the one Greek word for stepmother (μητρυιά), but the periphrasis might remind some of the heinousness of the sin, and of Leviticus 18:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And ye are puffed up; perhaps rather, And have ye been puffed up? The \"ye,\" being expressed m the Greek, is emphatic - \"ye, the very persons whose horror ought to have been most intense.\" It might seem inconceivable that any community calling itself Christian would fall so low as to be puffed up at the existence of such an offence among them. There is, indeed, a subtle and close connection between arrogance and sensuality, and beth are sometimes fatally linked to the conceit of religious knowledge without the reality. But not even a heathen community could have been \"puffed up\" on such grounds. Yet the Corinthians may have been \"puffed up\" with the conceited reasons which induced them to leave the offence unrebuked, because they boasted the possession of some spurious \"knowledge.\" Perhaps they bad seized some deadly notion of antinomian liberty, such as has existed at times among Gnostic sects, like the Ophites in ancient and the Anabaptists in modern days. Perhaps they sheltered themselves under the arrogant Jewish rule that all a man's conditions of life were altered by becoming a proselyte - that old relationships were for him entirely abolished; for the Jews held that a prosolyte was like \"a newborn child,\" and had begun life a second time (Bechoroth, f. 47, 1), and might marry any of his relatives. Such miserable sophisms would acquire fresh force from the universal impurity with which Corinthian society was stained, and which rendered it necessary for St. Paul in these Epistles to utter his most solemn warnings against every kind of sensuality (1 Corinthians 5:11; 1 Corinthians 6:15-18; 1 Corinthians 10:8; 1 Corinthians 15:83, 34; 2 Corinthians 5:11, etc.). But besides all this, St. Paul's remark does not necessarily mean that their \"inflation\" was exclusively connected with Gnostic excesses, which bore on the case of this offender. It may mean, \"Here is a gross fault in the midst of you, and yet - not propter hoc, but cum hoc - the characteristic of your religious factions is pride and conceit.\" This was indeed Κορινθιάζεσθαι, \"to play the Corinthian,\" in the worst sense, of that proverbial taunt. Possibly the prominence or wealth of the offender may have led to a more easy condonation of his crime. Exculpatory sophism may have been suggested by self interest. That; i.e. in order that, as a result of your godly sorrow, the offender might be removed from your midst. He that hath done this deed. The language of St. Paul, as always, is as delicate as clearness would allow. The fact that the verb is in the past aorist may perhaps allow us to hope that the offence, at any rate in its most aggravated forms, had ceased to be committed. The manner of the crime (\"in such a way\") seems to have been an aggravation of the crime itself. In this indignant verse we have, as Stanley says, \"the burst of the storm, the mutterings of which had been heard in the earlier chapters.\" So intense was the effect produced by St. Paul's stern severity, that a great part of the Second Epistle had to be devoted to allaying the agitation which these words had excited (see especially 2 Corinthians 7:8-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For I verily. The broken structure of the verse shows the deep emotion with which it was penned - as it were with sobs. St. Paul contrasts the line which he means to take with the lax condonation granted by the Corinthian Church. As absent; rather, being absent or though absent. The as is omitted in the best manuscripts. But present in spirit; literally, in the spirit;' but he is referring to his own spirit: \"Bodily I am absent; but speaking as though my spirit were present in your assembly [comp. 2 Kings 5:26], I have already judged,\" etc. Have judged already. My decision was instantaneous and is final. As though I were present. My sentence is as clear as though I were at this moment standing in the midst of you. That hath so done. The verb is not as before, poiesas, but katergasamenon, which is stronger, \"the perpetrator of this deed.\" The \"so\" means \"with all these circumstances of aggravation.\" The same verb is used in Romans 1:27. The broken periods of the Greek reflect the emotion of the writer. The passage is as it were written with sobs (Wordsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. The word \"Christ\" is probably an addition. The clause may either be taken with \"when ye are gathered together,\" or with \"to deliver\" (comp. 1 Timothy 5:21). With the power of our Lord Jesus. Each clause adds solemnity to the scene in which St. Paul imagines himself as standing with them in the spirit, and joining with the assembly of the Church, and armed with the authority of Christ, while he pronounces on the offender the sentence on which he had already determined. That he could claim \"the power of the Lord\" resulted from his possession of the Holy Spirit. and the special commission to bind and to loose, to remit and to retain, on earth, which Christ had entrusted to the apostles (Matthew 18:18, 20; John 20:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - To deliver such a one unto Satan. Scripture nowhere defines the character and limits of such a sentence as this. By cutting off an offender from Church communion (2 Thessalonians 3:14, 15), that is, from all the visible means of grace, he was for the time separated from spiritual influences, and was, therefore, so far handed over to Satan. The phrase is also applied to Hymenaeus and Alexander, in 1 Timothy 1:20. It is very doubtful whether it was necessarily meant to involve such physical inflictions as fell on Ananias, Sapphira, or Elymas. It is, however, important to observe that the intention of the sentence, like the true intention of excommunication, when exercised in a right spirit (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1, § 13), was not wrathful, but merciful. It was, as Calvin says, \"medicinale remedium\" - \"not for destruction, but for edification\" (2 Corinthians 10:8). Hymenaeus and Alexander were handed to Satan, not for their final ruin and damnation, but with a kind and remedial purpose, \"that they may learn not to blaspheme\" (1 Timothy 1:20), and this offender with the express object ', that his spirit may be saved.\" Had these facts been more deeply studied, there would have been a very different tone and spirit in many of the mediaeval anathemas. Such a one (setup. 2 Corinthians 2:7). He seems to hold aloof from the man's very name. So \"such as she\" (τὰς τοιαύτας) is used of the adulteress in John 8:7. For the destruction of the flesh; i.e. that all carnal influences in him might be destroyed. It is not his \"body\" which is to be destroyed, but the , \"flesh,\" the jetzer hara, or \"evil impulse,\" as the Jews called it. When this was destroyed, the body might once more become a temple of the Holy Ghost. That the spirit may be saved. The destruction of the lowest element of our human nature is the salvation of the highest; it is the cutting away of the dead corpse from the living soul. In the day of the Lord; when the Lord should judge the quick and the dead. The merciful intention of St. Paul is clearly developed in 2 Corinthians 2:6-11. He looked on God's judgments as remedial, not as solely retributive (1 Corinthians 11:29-32). Here, as Chrysostom finely says, the apostle lays down, as it were, his laws to the devil, telling him how far, and how far only, he can proceed. The object of excommunication is to save the offender, and not to do the devil's work by ensuring his eternal ruin. We can imagine how awful would be the solemnity of these words when they were first read aloud to the little Christian communities of Corinth. It was natural that they should produce an overwhelming excitement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Your glorying; rather, the subject of your boasting, the point on which you glorify yourselves. The Greek word does not mean the act of boasting, but the thing of which we boast. Not good. The Greek word is not agathon, but kalon, an almost untranslatable word, which implies all moral beauty, and resembles the English word \"fair\" or \"noble.\" When he says that it is \"not good,\" he uses the figure called litotes; i.e. he employs an expression intentionally too weak, that it may be corrected into a stronger one by the involuntary indignation of the reader; as when Virgil calls the cannibal tyrant Busiris \"unpraised.\" Hence the clause is equivalent to \"the thing of which you are boasting is detestable.\" Know ye not. This clause is used by St. Paul in specially solemn appeals, and almost exclusively in these Epistles (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:16, 19; 1 Corinthians 9:13, 24). A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump (Galatians 5:9). The taint alluded to is not only the presence of the unpunished offender, but the general laxity and impurity displayed by their whole bearing in the matter (comp. the line of Menander quoted in ch. 15:33, and the \"root of bitterness\" in Hebrews 12:15). (For the word \"lump,\" see Romans 11:16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPurge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Purge out therefore. The word \"therefore\" is absent from the best manuscripts, and the abruptness is more emphatic without it. No doubt the metaphor was suggested by the fact that St. Paul was writing about the time of the Passover (Acts 16:8). The most essential requisite of the Jewish regulations, with which his whole training had made him so familiar, was the absolute putting away, and even destruction, of every trace of leaven, which was diligently sought for the day before the Passover began. The putting away of leaven was a type of sanctification. The old leaven. \"Old\" as belonging to their unregenerate and unconverted condition; a remnant of the day when they had been Gentiles and Jews who had not known Christ. The least willing tolerance of the taint would cause it to work throughout the whole society. As ye are unleavened. Leaven is the type of evil in its secret and corrupting workings. Ideally, Christians can only be addressed as \"unleavened,\" i.e. as \"purged from their own old sins\" (2 Peter 1:9); and it is the method of Scripture (indeed, it is the only possible method) to address Christians as being Christians indeed, and therefore in their ideal rather than their actual character. Some have taken these words to mean, \"You are actually keeping the Passover, and therefore have no leaven among you;\" butNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the words cannot bear this meaning; norNEWLINENEWLINE(2) was St. Paul likely to appeal so prominently to a Jewish ordinance; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) he is thinking of the Christian Easter, and only borrowing a casual illustration from the Jewish Passover. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; rather, in the true reading, for our passover also was sacrificed - even Christ. As Christians, the Gentile Corinthians certainly did not keep the Jewish Passover; but St. Paul reminds them that they too had a Passover - that for them, too a Paschal Victim had been offered, whose sacrificial blood had been shed for their redemption (John 1:29; John 19:36; 1 Peter 1:19). (Comp. Hebrews 13:10, \"We have an altar.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Therefore let us keep the feast. Let us keep the Christian feast of Christ's resurrection in that spirit of holiness - of purging away sin from the midst of us - which was symbolized by the Jewish removal of leaven. Not with old leaven. For now ye are \"in Christ,\" and, therefore, are a \"new creation.\" Leaven is the type of hypocrisy (Luke 12:1) in its secret workings, but more generally it is a type of every corrupting influence. Of sincerity and truth. \"All that corresponds to an unsullied, uncontaminated, and genuine Christian character.\" The beautiful Greek word for \"sincerity\" means freedom from all admixture. It is, perhaps, derived from \"testing in the sunshine,\" and is used by St. Paul in 2 Corinthians 1:12; 2 Corinthians 2:17. \"Truth\" means \"reality.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-13. - Correction of a mistaken inference which they had deduced from a former letter of St. Paul's. Verse 9. - In an Epistle; rather, in the Epistle; in some former letter to the Church, which is no longer extant (comp. 2 Corinthians 10:10). The attempt to get rid of so plain a statement, in the supposed interests of some superstitious notion that every line which an apostle wrote to a Church must necessarily have been inspired and infallible, is at once unscriptural and grossly superstitious. The notion that \"the Epistle\" intended is this Epistle is an absurdity invented in the interests of the same fiction. The only hypothesis which could give the least plausibility to such a view is that which makes this paragraph a postscript or marginal addition after the letter was finished; but there is little or nothing in favour of such a view. Not to company with. The Greek word is rather stronger: not to be mingled up among (comp. 2 Thessalonians 3:14). The spirit of the injunction is repeated in Ephesians 5:11, \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Yet not altogether. The words correct a false inference, and mean, \"I did not intend absolutely to prohibit all communication with Gentiles guilty of this sin under all circumstances.\" Of this world. Those outside the pale of the Christian Church (comp. 1 Corinthians 3:19; 2 Corinthians 4:4). Or with the covetous. St. Paul often uses the Greek word in immediate connection with sins of impurity (1 Corinthians 6:10; 2 Corinthians 9:5; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:3), and, though it does not exclude the connotation of greed and avarice (2 Corinthians 9:7; 1 Thessalonians 2:5), it seems to have been used euphemistically of the deadliest form of heathen sensuality. The principle of selfishness may work equally in greed and in lust. Extortioners. The word may also mean \"ravishers,\" but there is no reason to abandon the sense of \"rapacious.\" Idolaters. This is the earliest instance of the use of this word, which does not occur in the LXX. No Christian could still be an open \"idolater.\" So, unless we suppose that the expression has slipped in involuntarily, we must here give the word a metaphorical sense, as in Colossians 3:5. We must else be driven to suppose that there were some half and half Christians, like Constantine, who \"feared the Lord, and served their own gods\" (comp. 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Corinthians 8:10; 1 Corinthians 10:7, 14; Ephesians 5:5). For then must ye needs go out of the world; for in that case (as they had perhaps implied in their letter of questions to St. Paul) ye would have been morally bound to leave the world altogether and seek a new one. The Greek particle ara perhaps refers to the astonishment caused by their misapprehension of St. Paul's rule. The clause throws painful light on the condition of the heathen world. If all communication with \"fornicators\" was to be forbidden, the sin was so universal, especially at Corinth, that all intercourse with Gentiles would have be. come impossible. Even some who professed to be stern moralists among the heathen, like Cato and Cicero, looked on the sin as being, at the worst, quite venial, and even, under certain circumstances, commendable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But now I have written unto you. The tense used is, perhaps, the epistolary aorist, and is therefore equivalent to \"but now I write to you;\" otherwise the sense is, \"but what I meant in my letter was,\" etc. The position of the words rather favours this view. St. Paul expressly tells them in 1 Corinthians 10:27 that he never intended to forbid all intercourse with heathens. They were not to be \"taken out of the world,\" but to be free from evil (John 17:15). If any man that is called a brother. The word \"brother\" was used before the name \"Christian\" was accepted by the members of the Church. Or an idolater (see 1 Corinthians 5:10; 1 Corinthians 10:7, 14). He might call himself a Christian, and yet be in reality an idolater (Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 3:5; Galatians 5:20; 1 John 5:21). With such a one no not to eat. If the phrase be pressed, it would involve exclusion from all privileges of the body, for the Holy Communion was celebrated in connection with the agapae. But the general meaning is that of 2 Thessalonians 3:6, \"We command you... that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? To pass sentence on heathens is no concern of mine; it is no part of my office. The phrase \"them that are without\" was originally a Jewish phrase. To the Jews all men were outsiders (chitsonin) except themselves. The phrase was adopted by Christians, but in a less contemptuous sense (1 Thessalonians 4:12; Colossians 4:5). We find a description of \"those that were without\" - \"aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise\" - in Ephesians 2:12. Do not ye judge them that are within! An appeal to their own practice and to common sense. Christian rules can, of course, only apply to Christian communities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - God judgeth. To that \"judgment of God\" (Romans 1:29) Christians must leave them. They have no jurisdiction over them. The mention of \"judging\" forms a natural transition to the next chapter. Therefore. The word is omitted in the best manuscripts. The command is more abruptly forcible without it. Put away from among yourselves that wicked person. The command would come the more powerfully because it is a direct reference to the language of Deuteronomy 17:7; Deuteronomy 24:7. The explanation, \"Put away the evil one [i.e. the devil] from among you!\" is adopted by Calvin, but is too general.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-11. - Litigation before heathen courts forbidden. Verse 1. - Dare any of you? rather, Dare any one of you? It is in St. Paul's view an audacious defiance of Christian duties to seek from the heathen the justice due from brother to brother. A matter; some ground of civil dispute. Against another; i.e. against another Christian. When one of the litigants was a heathen, Christians were allowed to go before heathen law courts, because no other remedy was possible. Go to law before the unjust. The \"unjust\" is here used for \"Gentiles,\" because it at once suggests a reason against the dereliction of Christian duty involved in such a step. How \"unjust\" the pagans were in the special sense of the word, the Christians of that day had daily opportunities of seeing; and in a more general sense, the Gentiles were \"sinners\" (Matthew 26:45). Even the Jews were bound to settle their civil disputes before their own tribunals. The ideal Jew was jashar, or \"the upright man,\" and Jews could not consistently seek integrity from those who were not upright. A fortiori, Christians ought not to do so. Before the saints. All Christians were ideally \"saints,\" just as the heathen were normally \"unjust.\" If Christians went to law with one another before the heathen, they belied their profession of mutual love, caused scandal, and were almost necessarily tempted into compliance with heathen customs, even to the extent of recognizing idols. Our Lord had already laid down the rule that \"brothers\" ought to settle their quarrels among themselves (Matthew 18:15-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Do ye not know? The word \"or\" should be supplied from א, A, B, C, D, F, etc. Bishop Wordsworth points out that this emphatic question occurs ten times in these two Epistles (1 Corinthians 3:6; 1 Corinthians 5:6; 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3, 9, 15, 16, 19; 1 Corinthians 9:13, 24), and only twice in all the rest (Romans 6:16; Romans 11:2). It was a fitting rebuke to those who took for knowledge their obvious ignorance. It resembles the \"Have ye not so much as read?\" to Pharisees who professed such profound familiarity with the Scriptures. That the saints shall judge the world. So Daniel (Daniel 7:22) had said, \"The Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High.\" Our Lord had confirmed this promise to his apostles, \"Ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel\" (Matthew 19:28). Various modes of evading the literal sense have been adopted, but even in the Book of Wisdom we find, \"They [the righteous] shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people\" (Wisd. 3:8). All speculation as to the manner and extent in which the saints shall share in the work of Christ as Judge of the quick and dead, are obviously futile. Shall be judged; literally, is being judged - the present points to the future, as though that which is inevitable is already in course of fulfilment. To judge the smallest matters; literally, of the smallest judgments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - That we shall judge angels. Angels, i.e. some who belong, or once did belong, to that class. The statement furnishes no data for further speculation. It can hardly mean \"evil spirits,\" for where the word is entirely unqualified it always means good angels; otherwise we might refer it to the \"angels which kept not their first estate\" (Jude 1:6). It is impossible, and not straightforward, to explain away the word \"angels\" as meaning Church officials, etc., or to make the word \"judge\" mean \"involve a condemnation of them by comparison with ourselves.\" All that we can say is that \"God chargeth even his angels with folly, and in his sight the very heavens are not clean\" (Job 4:18); and that \"to angels hath he not subjected the world to come\" (Hebrews 2:5). We must take the plain meaning of the apostle's words, whether we can throw any light on his conceptions or not. The only alternative is to suppose that the word means \"those who once were good angels,\" but are now fallen spirits. It was so understood by Tertullian, Chrysostom, etc. How much more; rather, to say nothing of. The accurate rendering of these verses is a matter of some difficulty, but not to an extent which affects the material sense, or which can be explained without a minute knowledge of Greek.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If then ye have, etc. The verse implies that civil disputes might naturally occur among them. What he is here reprobating is their objectionable method of settling them. Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church. This implies an utter scorn of trivial quarrels about personal rights. Surely the lowliest, the most unregarded members of the Church - those of no account - have wisdom enough to decide in such small matters. Thus when there arose a murmuring between Hebrews and Hellenists about the daily distribution to widows, the apostles, thinking that they had much more important work in hand than the adjustment of such jealousies, left the whole matter in the hands of the seven deacons. Some understand \"those held of no account in the Church\" to mean heathens; but he is here forbidding them to bring their quarrels before the heathens. Of course, ideally, none ought to be \"despised\" or \"held of no account\" in the Church; but St. Paul is here speaking relatively, and with reference to the views of the Corinthians themselves, and not without irony. The perfect participle, \"those who have been set at nought,\" perhaps means persons of proved inferiority of judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I speak to your shame. He adds this to account for the severe irony of the last remark. Not a wise man among you. Among you, who set yourselves up as so specially wise!

Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Now therefore; rather, Nay more, already. Utterly; rather, generally, \"altogether,\" \"looking at the question as a whole.\" A fault. The word means \"a defect,\" or possibly \"a loss\" (Romans 11:12, \"the diminishing\"). Your going to law is an inferiority or deficiency; you ought to know of \"a more excellent way.\" Why do ye not rather take wrong? Strange as such advice would sound to heathens, who prided themselves on the passionate resentment of injuries as though it were a virtue, this had been the distinct teaching of our Lord; \"Resist not evil\" (Matthew 5:39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Nay, ye do wrong and defraud.

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Know ye not; rather, Or know ye not, as before. Are you defying God, or does your sin arise from mere ignorance? The unrighteous; better, that wrong doers, the verb being the same as \"ye do wrong\" in ver. 8. Perhaps the Corinthians thought that they would be saved by the mere fact of having been admitted into God's kingdom (the Christian Church in all its highest privileges) by baptism. St. Paul here lays down, as distinctly as St. James does, that faith without works is dead, and privileges without holiness are abrogated. The spirit of his warning is the same as that of Jeremiah 7:4, \"Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord... are these;\" or that of St. John the Baptist, \"Say not unto yourselves, We be Abraham's sons.\" Christians have often been liable to the temptation of underrating the peril which results from the falling asunder of action from knowledge. There can be no greater danger than that of talking slightingly of \"mere morality.\" Religion is not an outward service, but a spiritual life manifested by a holy living. Be not deceived. So our Lord says,\" Let no man deceive you\" (Mark 13:5; comp. 1 John 3:7). St. Paul uses the warning very solemnly again in 1 Corinthians 15:33 and Galatians 6:7, and St. James in James 1:16. The self deception of merely verbal orthodoxy is the most dangerous of all. Neither fornicators. The first four classes of sinners were specially prevalent at Corinth, where, indeed, impurity formed part of the recognized cult of the local Aphrodite (comp. 2 Corinthians 12:21). Lists of these \"works of the flesh,\" which were the all but universal curse and stain of heathendom, occur also in Galatians 5:19-21; 1 Timothy 1:10, etc.; Colossians 3:5-7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Nor thieves, etc. (see Revelation 22:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And such were some of you; literally, and these things some of you were. As Gentiles, many of them had been \"dead in trespasses and sins\" (Ephesians 2:1). (For a similar contrast of the change wrought by the Spirit of God, see Titus 3:3-7.) But ye are washed. The voice and tense in the original differ from those of the following words. This cannot be accidental. It is better, therefore, to render, But ye washed away your sins; i.e. ye, by your baptism, washed away those stains (Acts 22:16). The very object of Christ's death had been that he might cleanse his Church \"by the washing of water by the Word.\" But ye are sanctified, but ye are justified; rather, but ye were sanctified, but y? were justified, namely, at your conversion. By \"sanctified\" is meant, not the progressive course of sanctification, but the consecration to God by baptism (Wickliffe, \"halowed\"). (For what St. Paul meant by justification, see Romans 3:24-26.) In the Name of the Lord Jesus, etc. This clause and the next belongs to all the three previous verbs. Of our God. In the word \"our\" is involved that appeal to Christian unity of which he never loses sight throughout the letter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-20. - The inexcusable sin and shame of fornication. Verse 12. - All things are lawful unto me. The abruptness with which the phrase is introduced perhaps shows that, in the letter of the Corinthians to St. Paul, they had used some such expression by way of palliating their lax tolerance of violations of the law of purity. By \"all things,\" of course, is only meant \"all things which are indifferent in themselves.\" They erroneously applied this maxim of Christian liberty to that which was inherently sinful, and thus were tempted to \"make their liberty a cloak of viciousness.\" St. Paul, as Bengel observes, often, and especially in this Epistle, uses the first person generally in gnomic or semi-proverbial sentences (1 Corinthians 6:15; 1 Corinthians 7:7; 1 Corinthians 10:23, 29, 30; 1 Corinthians 14:11). But. This is St. Paul's correction of too broad a formula. Are not expedient. St. Paul illustrates this in 1 Corinthians 8:8-10. We have no right to do even that which is innocent, if it be disadvantageous to the highest interests of ourselves or others. \"He alone,\" says St. Augustine, \"does not fall into unlawful things who sometimes abstains by way of caution even from lawful ones.\" Will not be brought under the power. The play of words in the original might be imitated by saying, \"All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any.\" In other words, \"boundless intemperance\" may become a tyranny. The pretence of moral freedom may end in a moral bondage.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Obedience is better than freedom?

Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Meats for the belly, etc. The argument of the Corinthians about the indifference of eating \"meats\" which were merely ceremonially unclean was quite tenable. Things Levitically unclean might be essentially pure, and both food and the body which lives thereby are things \"which perish in the using\" (Colossians 2:22). Shall destroy; shall bring to nought. This would occur when the physical body becomes a spiritual body, like that of the angels of God (1 Corinthians 15:51, 52). How vile, then, is it to make a god of the belly - only to sleep and feed! Both it and them. There shall be no need for the belly when men \"shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more\" (Revelation 7:16); and the meat alluded to is \"meat which perisheth\" (Luke 15:16). Now the body is net for fornication, but for the Lord. The argument, therefore, which would class this sin as a matter of indifference, as was the Levitical distinction between different kinds of food, at once fell to the ground. Food was a necessity, and the stomach was formed for its assimilation. Fornication is not a venial but \"a deadly sin.\" It is not a natural necessity, but a consuming evil. The body was created for higher ends - namely, to be a temple of God. \"God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness\" (1 Thessalonians 4:7). And the Lord for the body. Therefore our members ought to be used \"as instruments of righteousness unto God\" (Romans 5:13), and our bodies presented as a living, holy, reasonable, acceptable sacrifice to him (Romans 12:1). The end of our existence is \"to serve God here and enjoy him forever hereafter.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - God hath both raised up the Lord.

The Church is often alluded to as \"the body of Christ\" (Ephesians 1:23; Colossians 1:18; Colossians 2:19, etc.). Elsewhere the union between Christ and Christians is described by the metaphor of a tree and its branches; a building and the stones of which it is composed (Ephesians 2:21, 22). God forbid. An admirable idiom to express the real force of the original, which means, \"May it never be!\" (for the rationale of the Greek phrase, I may refer to my 'Brief Greek Syntax,' p. 135). It occurs in Romans 3:4, 6, 31; Romans 6:15; Romans 7:7, 13; Romans 9:14; Romans 11:1, 11; Galatians 2:17; Galatians 3:21. The formula, which involves the indignant rejection of some false conclusion, is characteristic of the second group of St. Paul's Epistles, but especially (as will be seen) of the Epistle to the Romans.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - What, know ye not, etc.? The clause is used to explain and justify the strong expression which he had used in the previous verse. It involves an argument against the sin which is the most original and impressive which could have been used. To this passage especially is due the tone taken by Christians as to these sins, which differed so totally from that taken by heathen. They two. The words do not occur in Genesis 2:24, but are always so quoted in the New Testament (Matthew 19:5; Mark 10:8; Ephesians 5:31). Saith he. This is a vague Jewish formula of quotation, adopted to avoid the needless introduction of the sacred Name. \"He\" is \"God\" in Scripture. Shall be one flesh; rather, shall become. This appeal to Genesis 2:24 (Matthew 19:5) is equivalent to the rule that no intercourse between the sexes is free from sin except under the sanction of marriage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - That is joined unto the Lord. This phrase, indicating the closest possible union, is found in Deuteronomy 10:20; 2 Kings 18:6. Is one spirit. There is a \"mystical union,\" not only \"betwixt Christ and his Church,\" but also between Christ and the holy soul Hence, to St. Paul, spiritual life meant the indwelling of Christ in the heart - the life \"in Christ;\" so that he could say, \"It is no more I that live, but Christ that liveth in me\" (Galatians 2:20; Galatians 3:27; Colossians 3:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFlee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Flee fornication. In the battle against sensual sins, there is no victory except in absolute flight, for the reason which immediately follows, namely, that these sins have their dwelling in that body which is part of our being, and which yet they tend to destroy. They make a man his own deadliest enemy. Every sin... is without the body. Some have supposed that this cannot apply to gluttony and drunkenness, which they therefore class with fornication; but even in those sins, as in suicide, the cause of and incentive to the sin is external, whereas the source of uncleanness is in the heart and in the thoughts, which come from within, and so defile the man. Other sins may be with and by means of the body, and may injure the body; but none are so directly against the sanctity of the whole bodily being as fornication. Sinneth against his own body. By alienating it from the service of him to whom it belongs; by incorporating it with the degradation of another; by staining the flesh and the body (Proverbs 5:8-11; Proverbs 6:24-32; Proverbs 7:24-27); by subtly poisoning the inmost sanctities of his own being. St. Paul is here thinking mainly, however, if not exclusively, of the moral injury and defilement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - That your body is the temple (or rather, a sanctuary) of the Holy Ghost. He has already said that the Church is a shrine or sanctuary of the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 3:16); but here for the first time expression is given to one of the deepest and newest truths of Christianity (comp. 2 Corinthians 6:16). Three great epochs are marked by the use of the word temple. In the Old Testament it means the material temple, the sign of a localized worship and a separated people; in the Gospels our Lord uses it of his own mortal body; in the Epistles it is used (as here) of the body of every baptized Christian, sanctified by the indwelling Spirit of God. Ye are not your own. We cannot, therefore, use our bodies as though they were absolutely under our own control. They belong to God, and, \"whether we live or die, we are the Lord's\" (Romans 14:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Ye are bought with a price. That price is the blood of Christ, wherewith he purchased the Church (Acts 20:28; Hebrews 9:12; 1 Peter 1:18, 19; Revelation 5:9). This metaphor of ransom (1 Corinthians 7:23; 2 Peter 2:1) has its full and absolute applicability to man. The effect of Christ's death for us is that we are redeemed from slavery and prison, and the right of our possession is with Christ. Thus by various metaphors the effects of redemption are revealed to us on the human side. When we unduly press the metaphor, and ask from whom we were purchased, and to whom the price was paid, we build up scholastic systems which have only led to error, and respecting which the Church has never sanctioned any exclusive opinion. The thoughts touched upon in this verse are fully developed in the Epistle to the Romans. Glorify God; by behaving as his redeemed children, and therefore by keeping yourselves pure. In these few brief words St. Paul sums up all he has said, as he did in 1 Corinthians 5:13. In your body. The following words, \"and in your spirit, which are God's,\" are a perfectly correct and harmless gloss, but are not found in the best manuscripts, and are foreign to the drift of the passage. Your body is a temple, and in that temple God must be honoured. (As Augustine says, \"Dost thou wish to pray in a temple? pray in thyself. But first be a temple of God.\") \"Unchastity dishonours God, and that in his own temple (Romans 2:23)\" (Meyer). In these clauses St. Paul has touched on three subjects which occupy important sections of the remainder of the Epistle, namely,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the relation between the sexes (ch. 7.);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the question of idol offerings (ch. 8.); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the doctrine of the resurrection (ch. 15.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-40. - Answers to the inquiries of the Corinthians respecting marriage.

The word used is not agathon, good, but kalon, fair; \"an excellent thing.\" In ver. 26 he limits the word by the clause, \"good for the present necessity.\" There is no limitation here, and it is probable that St. Paul is quoting the actual words of the letter which he had received from Corinth. There had sprung up among them some antinomians, who, perhaps by perverting his own teaching or that of Apollos, had made liberty a cloak of lasciviousness. In indignant reaction against such laxity, others, perhaps, with Essene proclivities, had been led to disparage matrimony as involving an inevitable stain. Gnosticism, and the spirit which led to it, oscillated between the two extremes of asceticism and uncleanness. Both extremes were grounded on the assertion that matter is inherently evil. Ascetic Gnostics, therefore, strove to destroy by severity every carnal impulse; antinomian Gnostics argued that the life of the spirit was so utterly independent of the flesh that what the flesh did was of no consequence. We find the germs of Gnostic heresy long before the name appeared. Theoretically, St. Paul inclines to the ascetic view, not in the abstract, but in view of the near advent of Christ, and of the cares, distractions, and even trials which marriage involved in days of struggle and persecution. Yet his wisdom is shown in the cautious moderation with which he expresses himself. The tone of the letter written by Gregory the Great to Augustine with reference to similar inquiries about Saxon converts is very different. The example of St. Paul should have shown the mediaeval moralists and even the later Fathers how wrong it is \"to give themselves airs of certainty on points where certainty is not to be had.\" Not to touch a woman. St. Paul means generally \"not to marry\" (comp. Genesis 20:4 [LXX.]). Celibacy under the then existing conditions of the Christian world is, he admits, in itself an honourable and morally salutary thing, though, for the majority, marriage may be a positive duty. He is not dreaming of the nominal marriages of mediaeval ascetics, for he assumes and directs that all who marry should live in conjugal union.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Nevertheless. In this single word St. Paul practically refutes all the dangerous and unwarrantable inferences drawn by St. Jerome and others from the previous clause. St. Jerome argues: \"If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, it must be bad to do so, and therefore celibacy is a holier state than marriage.\" He also says, \"I suspect the goodness of a thing which the greatness of another evil enforces as a lesser evil.\" Such reasoning shows:NEWLINENEWLINE1. The danger of pressing words to the full extent of the logical inferences which may be deduced from them.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The errors which always arise from arguing upon isolated texts dissevered from their context, and from all consideration of the circumstances under which they were written.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The necessity of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit when he shows, by history and experience, the need for altering precepts with reference to altered conditions. There is in celibacy a moral beauty - it is kalon; there are cases in which it becomes a duty. But in most cases marriage, being no less a duty, as St. Paul proceeds to show, is even fairer and more excellent. Neither state, the wedded or the unwedded, is in itself more holy than the other. Each has its own honour and loveliness, and can only be judged of in connection with surrounding circumstances. Those who make St. Paul judge slightingly of marriage contradict his own express rules and statements (Ephesians 5:24, 31, 32; 1 Timothy 2:15), and make him speak the current heathen language of heathen epicures, who, to the great injury of morals, treated marriage as a disagreeable necessity, which was, if possible, to be avoided. If the \"it is a good thing\" of St. Paul in ver. 1 were to be taken absolutely, it would have to be correctedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) by the example of Christ, who beautified with his presence the marriage at Cana (John 2:1, 2);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by the primeval law which said, \"It is not good for man to be alone\" (Genesis 2:18); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) by the fact that marriage is the chosen analogue of the relation between Christ and his Church. But the very phrase he uses, as will be seen by reference to 1 Corinthians 9:15; Matthew 15:26; Romans 14:21, etc., is a relative not an absolute one, and St. Paul uses it here concessively, but with the object of pointing out limitations which almost reversed it. To avoid fornication; rather, because o f fornication; i.e. because of the many forms of impurity which were current every where, but especially at Corinth. Some have argued that St. Paul takes a \"low\" and \"poor\" view of marriage by regarding it only in the light of a remedy against fornication. The answer is:NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the reason which he assigns is a true reason in itself, and with reference to the masses of mankind; for which reason it is adopted by our Church in her Marriage Service.NEWLINENEWLINE2. He is addressing those who were living in a corrupt and semi-heathen atmosphere.NEWLINENEWLINE3. He is not here speaking of the idealized and spiritual aspect of marriage, but only of large practical necessities. When he speaks of marriage as a high Christian mystery (as in 2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:22-33), he adopts a very different tone. Let every man have. A rule, not a mere permission. He here implies the truth that married love bears no analogy whatever to the vagae libidines of those who live like \"natural brute beasts.\" In marriage the sensuous impulse, by being controlled and placed under religious sanctions is refined and purified from a degradation into a sacrament. Instead of being any longer the source of untold curses to mankind, it becomes the condition of their continuance and an element in their peace, because it is then placed under the blessing of God and of his Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Due benevolence. An euphemistic and needless modification by the copyists of the pure and simple expression of St. Paul, which, as shown by the best manuscripts, is \"her due\" - debitum tori. St. Paul is evidently entering on these subjects, not out of any love for them; but because all kinds of extreme views - immoral indifference and over scrupulous asceticism - had claimed dominance among the Corinthians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The wife hath not power, Marriage is not a capricious union, but a holy bond. \"They two\" become \"one flesh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDefraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Defraud ye not. St. Paul purposely leaves the expression general. Primarily he is thinking of \"the due\" or \"the power\" which each has over the other, as is shown by the next verse; but he does not confine the expression to this. Except it be; literally, unless by chance. The exception he regards as something possible, but not normal. For a time. By this and the next words he disparages, by anticipation, the celibate and separate married lives which, in a corrupt age, were so much and so unwisely admired in the ascetic saints of the Middle Ages. Temporary separation for special reasons had been recognized from the earliest times (Exodus 19:15; 1 Samuel 21:4). Ye may give yourselves; rather, ye may have leisure. The verb is in the aorist, which shows that the \"leisure\" contemplated was for brief periods, not during continuous years. It was altered to the present by the officious copyists, who believed in external and mechanical rules of holiness. To fasting and prayer. \"Fasting\" is an ascetic interpolation, not found in א, A, B, C, D, F. On this interpolation, and perhaps on the analogy of the rule given by Moses at Sinai (Exodus 19:15), rose the practice of married persons living apart at Lent (Stanley). Come together again. The prepossessions of ascetic scribes have again tampered with the text. The true reading is, \"be together again\" (ῆτε), not \"come together\" (συνέρχησθε). For your incontinency; rather, because of. Their past lives and their present temptations were a warning that they could not lay on themselves burdens which God did not require. They should not striveNEWLINENEWLINE\"...to wind themsleves to highNEWLINEFor sinful man beneath the sky.\" Violent, unnatural, self tormenting, repressions beyond what God demands, and adopted without reference to the strength or the circumstances of individual natures, only tend, as all ascetics have confessed, to increase rather than to diminish the force of sensual temptations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I speak this. The \"this\" applies to his advice in general, but especially to the last verse. By permission. This phrase is generally misunderstood. It does not mean that St. Paul was permitted though not commanded to give this advice, but that his gentle advice was given \"by way of permission\" to Christians, not \"by way of injunction.\" He means to say that he leaves the details of their lives, whether celibate or married, to their individual consciences, though with large hearted wisdom and charity he would emancipate them from human and unauthorized restrictions. The clause is not, therefore, a parallel to the restrictions on the authority of his utterances, such as we find in vers. 12, 29, 40, and in 2 Corinthians 8:10; 2 Corinthians 11:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For I would. The verb here used is thelo (will). In 1 Timothy 5:14 he says, \"I prefer (boulomai) that the younger women marry.\" Even as I myself; endowed, that is, with the gift of continence, which would (in the expected nearness of Christ's coming) render marriage needless, and the condition of man like that of the angels in heaven, who neither marry nor are given in marriage. His proper gift. The \"gifts\" alluded to are the \"graces\" (charismata) of the Holy Spirit; and the grace of perfect continence does not exist equally in all (Matthew 19:11). One after this manner, and another after that. The remark is general, but also has its special application to continence and marriage (Matthew 19:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. -To the unmarried; including widowers. In my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:75-82, I have given my reasons for believing that St. Paul was a widower. It is good for them. It is an expedient, honourable, and morally \"beautiful thing,\" but, as he so distinctly points out further on, there might be a \"better\" even to the \"good.\" Even as I. In the unmarried state, whether as one who had never married, or, as I infer from various circumstances, as a widower (so too Clemens of Alexandria, Grotius, Luther, Ewald, etc.); see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:169). Tertullian and Jerome (both of them biassed witnesses, and with no certain support of tradition) say that St. Paul was never married.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If they cannot contain; rather, if they have not continency. Let them marry. In 1 Timothy 5:14 he lays down and justifies the same rule with reference to young widows. It is better to marry than to burn. The original tenses give greater force and beauty to this obvious rule of Christian common sense and morality. The \"marry\" is in the aorist - \"to marry once for all,\" and live in holy married union; the \"burn\" is in the present - \"to be on fire with concupiscence.\" Marriage once for all is better than continuous lust; the former is permitted, the latter sinful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And; rather, but. Unto the married; to Christians who have already married. I command. This is an injunction, not a mere permission as in ver. 6. Not I, but the Lord. Because the rule had been laid down by Christ himself (Mark 10:11, 12; Matthew 5:32; Matthew 19:6; Luke 16:18). Let not the wife depart. By divorce or otherwise. The wife is mentioned, perhaps, because the Christian wife, in the new sense of dignity and sacredness which Christianity had bestowed upon her, might be led to claim this spurious freedom; or perhaps the Christian women of Corinth had been more impressed than their husbands by the Essene notions of purity. The exception of divorce being permissible in case of fornication is assumed (Matthew 5:32; Matthew 19:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - If she depart. The reference throughout the verse is to separation due to incompatibility of temper, etc.; not to legal divorce.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-16. - Directions about mixed marriages. Verse 12. - To the rest. That is, to those who are married, but are heathen. They were the remaining class about whose duties the Corinthians had made inquiry. Not the Lord. The Lord had made no express reference to such cases, since it had been no part of his mission to lay down minute details which would be duly settled from age to age by the wisdom taught by the Holy Ghost. She be pleased to dwell with him. It is assumed that, if she did not please, the poor Christian convert would have no protection of his fights; pagan courts would regard conversion as a sufficient reason for breaking off marriages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Let her not leave him. The verb is the same as in the clause rendered \"let him not put her away.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Is sanctified; literally, has been sanctified, the status has been rendered (so to speak) theoretically clean. By the wife; literally, in the wife. The bond is still holy; its holiness rests in the believing wife or husband. The reasoning would remove any scruples which Jewish Christians might derive from Deuteronomy 7:3, etc. By the husband; rather, in the brother. The liberty implied by these remarks, contrasting so strongly with the rigid rules laid down in the days of Ezra (Ezra 9; Nehemiah 9.) recall the change of dispensation. Unclean; i.e. not placed in immediate covenant relation to God. But now are they holy. This does not necessarily imply that they were baptized as infants, but only that they were hallowed as the fruit of a hallowed union. See the remarkable words of Malachi (Malachi 2:15). \"If the root be holy, so are the branches\" (Romans 11:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - If the unbelieving depart. The sense of the word rendered \"depart\" is rather \"wishes to be separated.\" Is not under bondage; literally, has not been enslaved. Our Lord assumes one cause alone - unfaithfulness - as adequate for the disruption of the marriage tie; but he was not contemplating, as St. Paul is, the case of mixed marriages. To peace; rather, in peace. Peace is to be the sphere in which the calling comes, and in which it issues. Milton, in his 'Tetrachordon,' quotes Maimonides to the effect that \"divorce was permitted by Moses to preserve peace in marriage and quiet in the family.\" Similarly, a voluntary separation might be the only possible means of preserving moral peace where the union was between souls separated from each other by so vast a gulf as those of a pagan and a Christian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For what knowest thou, O wife, etc.? The meaning is as follows: - You may, perhaps, plead that, by refusing to sever the union, the believing partner may convert the unbelieving; but that possibility is too distant and uncertain on which to act. St. Peter does indeed show that so blessed a result is possible (\"That, if any obey not the Word, they also maybe won... by the conversation of the wives,\" 1 Peter 3:1); but he is only speaking of cases in which the unbelieving husband did not wish the union to be dissolved. The ancient misinterpretation of the passage (due to neglect of the context and of the argument as a whole) viewed it as an argument for mixed marriages, founded on the chance of thereby winning souls. Most misinterpretations of Scripture have done deadly harm; this one, however, has been overruled for good, and led, as Dean Stanley points out, to such happy marriages as that of Clotilde with Clovis, and Bertha with Ethelbert of Kent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-24. - Corroborative instances of the duty of remaining in the state wherein each was called. Verse 17. - But; literally, if not. The phrase introduces a caution. The rule is that the circumstances of our lives are regulated by the providence of God, and must not be arbitrarily altered at our own caprice. Christ allotted his portion to each Christian, God hath called each man; that lot and that call are to guide his life. \"Qua positus fueris in statione mane\" (Ovid). Hath distributed; rather, apportioned. So ordain I in all Churches. He proceeds to give specific instances to which his rule applies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Being circumcised. The first instance he gives is that of Judaism and paganism. The circumcised Jew is to remain circumcised; the uncircumcised Gentile is not to undergo circumcision. Become uncircumcised. The Hellenising Jews in the days of the priest Menelaus (1 Macc. 1:15; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05, 1) had discovered a process for obliterating the appearance of circumcision; such persons were known as masochim. St. Paul does not permit the adoption of this course. In the rebellion of Barcocheba many obliterated the sign of circumcision, and were afterwards, at great danger to themselves, recircumcised. ('Yevamoth,' tel. 72, 1). Let him not be circumcised. This rule was of much more practical significance than the other. The early fortunes of Christianity had been almost shipwrecked by the attempt of Jewish rigorists to enforce this odious bondage on the Gentiles, and their deliverance flora it had been due almost solely to St. Paul. It was his inspired insight which had swayed the decision of the synod at Jerusalem (Acts 15.); and at a later period his Epistle to the Galatians was the manifesto of Gentile emancipation. He proved that after Christ's death \"circumcision\" (peritome) became to Gentiles a mere physical mutilation (katatome) (Philippians 3:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCircumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Circumcision is nothing. The Jews regarded it as everything; and to make this assertion at so early an epoch of Christian history, required all the courage of St. Paul, and proved his grand originality. He was the first to prove to the Jews that circumcision had become a thing intrinsically indifferent, which might, under some circumstances, be desirable (as in the case of Timothy), but could never be reckoned among essentials. And uncircumcision is nothing. The same sentence occurs three times in St. Paul, summing up, as it were, the liberty which it had cost him endless peril and anguish to achieve. Each time he concludes it with a weighty clause to show what is everything: \"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God\" (ver. 19); \"... but faith which worketh by love\" (Galatians 5:6); \"... but a new creation\" (Galatians 6:15). But the keeping of the commandments. So St. John says, \"Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Let every man abide in the same calling, etc. In accordance with this general principle, which illustrates the distinction between Christianity and violent social revolutions, St. John the Baptist had not bidden publicans or soldiers to abandon their callings, but to do their duty in that state of life to which God had called them (Luke 3:12-14). The \"calling\" alluded to is not what is described as \"a vocation,\" a calling in life, but the condition in which we are when we are called by God (comp. 1 Corinthians 1:26; Ephesians 1:18; Ephesians 4:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArt thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Being a servant. This is the second instance of the rule. One who was converted whilst he was a slave is not to strive over anxiously for freedom. The word \"emancipation\" sometimes seems (as in the letter to Philemon) to be \"trembling on Paul's lips,\" but he never utters it, because to do so would have been to kindle social revolt, and lead to the total overthrow of Christianity at the very commencement of its career. Our Lord had taught the apostles to adapt means to ends; and the method of Christianity was to inculcate great principles, the acceptance of which involved, with all the certainty of a law, the ultimate regeneration of the world. Christianity came into the world as the dawn, not as the noon - a shining light, which brightened more and more unto the perfect day. Care not for it. Do not be troubled by the fact, because in Christ \"there is neither bond nor free\" (Galatians 3:28), and because earthly freedom is as nothing in comparison with the freedom which Christ gives (John 8:36). But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. The words may mean,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"use freedom\" - avail yourself of the opportunity of emancipation; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"use slavery\" - be content to remain a slave. In favour of the first interpretation is the fact that there is nothing extravagant or fantastic in Christian morality; and that, considering what ancient slavery was - how terrible its miseries, how shameful and perilously full of temptations were its conditions - it sounds unnatural to advise a Christian slave to remain a slave when he might gain his freedom. Yet the other interpretation, remain a slave by preference, seems to be required:NEWLINENEWLINE1. By the strict interpretation of the Greek particles.NEWLINENEWLINE2. By the entire context, which turns on the rule that each man should stay in the earthly condition in which he first received God's call.NEWLINENEWLINE3. By the fact that even the Stoic moralists - like Epictetus, who was himself a slave - gave similar advice (Epict., 'Dissert.,' 3:26; 'Enchir.,' 10:32.)NEWLINENEWLINE4. By the indifference which St. Paul felt and expressed towards mere earthly conditions (Galatians 3:28), as things of no real significance (Colossians 3:22).NEWLINENEWLINE5. By his appeal to the nearness of the day of Christ (vers. 29-31).NEWLINENEWLINE6. By the preponderance of high authorities - Chrysostom, Theodoret, Luther, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Alford, etc. - in favour of this viewNEWLINENEWLINE7. By its parallelism to the advice given to Christian slaves in 1 Timothy 6:2, where they are urged to serve Christian masters all the more zealously because they were brethren.NEWLINENEWLINE8. Lastly, all the apparent harshness of the advice is removed when we remember that St. Paul was probably thinking only of the Christian slaves of Christian masters, between whom the relation might be as happy as that of Philemon to the forgiven Onesimus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Is the Lord's freeman; rather, freedman. Clearly the entire bearing of this verse favours the view which we have taken of the previous verse. Christ's servant. The sharp antithesis of this verse was often present to the mind of the early Christians. They knew that the bondage of Satan was so crushing that mere earthly bondage was, in comparison, as nothing; and that the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, though it might seem to take the form of service, was the sole perfect freedom. The freedmen of sin are the most hopeless slaves; the servants of God alone are free (see Romans 6:22; 2 Timothy 2:26; 1 Peter 2:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ye are bought with a price; rather, ye were bought, namely, by Christ; and the price paid for you was his blood (see 1 Corinthians 6:20; 1 Peter 1:18, 19). Be not ye; rather, become not. The servants of men. There is a grand play of words in the advice to them not to become slaves, at the very moment when he is advising them to continue in slavery. In that which the world called \"slavery\" the Christian slave might enjoy absolute liberty. The price which a master paid for them was but an unmeaning shadow; they had been bought once and eternally by an infinitely nobler price, and that purchase was the pledge of absolute emancipation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBrethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Therein abide with God. The verse is a summary and reiteration of the advice contained in the whole paragraph. \"With God;\" literally, by the side of God; \"as in God's sight;\" \"doing service as to the Lord;\" \"for conscience towards God.\" The words sum up the essence of all apostolic counsels to Christian slaves in Ephesians 6:5-8; 1 Timothy 6:1, 2; Titus 2:9, 10; 1 Peter 2:18, 19, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-40. - Advice respecting the unmarried. Verse 25. - Now concerning virgins. This is doubtless another reference to questions contained in the letter from Corinth. No commandment of the Lord. Christ had never directly dealt with this subject. I give my judgment. The word \"commandment\" is rendered in the Vulgate consillum, and the word \"judgment\" praeceptum; and thus, as Stanley points out, has originated the modern Romish distinction between \"precepts\" and \"counsels of perfection,\" which, however, have clearly no connection with the real meaning of the passage. To be faithful. As a steward of his Word, which is the first essential of true ministry (1 Timothy 1:12). \"Faith makes a true casuist\" (Bengel).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I suppose. St. Paul only states this modestly, and somewhat hesitatingly, as his personal opinion. For the present distress; rather, on account of the pressing necessity; in the urgent and trying conditions which at the present moment surround the Christian's life, and which were the prophesied \"woes of the Messiah\" (Matthew 24:3, etc.). For a man; rather, for a person - whether man or woman. Be to be; that is, unmarried. The words are not improbably a quotation from the Corinthian letter. Otherwise we might explain the \"so\" to mean \"as he is - whether married or unmarried.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArt thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Seek not a wife. It is entirely alien from St. Paul's purpose to take this as an abstract or universal rule. He gives his reasons for it as a temporary necessity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned. This advice merely touches on the question of expediency, not on questions of absolute right and wrong. Such. Those who marry. Trouble in the flesh. Their marriage will in these days necessarily involve much trouble and discomfort. Common experience shows that in days of \"trouble and rebuke and blasphemy\" the cares and anxieties of those who have to bear the burden of many besides themselves, and those dearer to them than their own selves, are far the most trying. Perhaps St. Paul was thinking of the \"Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days,\" of our Lord (Luke 21:23). But I spare you. I desire to spare you from adding to the inevitable distress which will fall upon you in \"the great tribulation\" - \"the travail throes of the Messiah,\" which we all expect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - But this I say. I will not dwell on those coming trials, but will only remind you that they are imminent, and that when they come all earthly distinctions will vanish into insignifiance. The time is short; literally, the season has been contracted; in other words, \"The end of all things is at hand\" (1 Peter 4:7). The word sunestalmenos cannot mean \"disastrous.\" The verb is used for \"folding up\" in Acts 5:6; \"Tempus in collecto est\" (Tertullian). It remaineth, that. The reading and punctuation are here uncertain. The best reading seems to be \"The time has been shortened henceforth, in order that,\" etc. The very object of the hastened end is that Christians should sit loose to earthly interests. As though they had none. They would thus be nearer to the condition of the \"angels in heaven.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - They that weep, etc. Earthly sorrow and joy and wealth are things which are merely transient and unreal when compared with the awful, eternal, permanent realities which we shall all soon have to face.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - As not abusing it; rather, as not using it to the full - not draining dry the cup of earthly advantages (comp. 1 Corinthians 9:18). Like Gideon's true heroes, we must not fling ourselves down to drink greedily of the river of earthly gifts, but drink them sparingly, and as it were with the palm of the hand. The fashion of this world passeth away. So St. John says, \"The world passeth away, and the lust thereof\" (1 John 1:18). It is but as the shifting scene of a theatre, or as a melting vapour (James 4:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I would have you without carefulness.

In these words he reverts to ver. 28, after the digression about the transiency of earthly relations. If they were \"overcharged... with cares of this life,\" the day of the Lord might easily \"come upon them unawares\" (Luke 21:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Careth for the things that are of the world. St. Paul's language must not be extravagantly pressed. It only applies absolutely to times in which the conditions are the same as they then were. The \"anxious cares\" which marriage involves may be more innocent and less distracting than those which attack the celibate condition; and when that is the case, marriage, on St. Paul's own principle, becomes a duty. Thus some of the best and greatest of our missionaries have found their usefulness as God's messengers vastly increased by marriage, in spite of the awful trials which marriage often involves. The apostles and brethren of the Lord felt the same. St. Paul's opinions here are, as he tells us, opinions only, and admit of many modifications. Advice given to men and women when Christians believed that the Lord was coming, perhaps in that very age, to judge the world, is not universally applicable to all ages. In St. Paul's later Epistles he does not revert to this advice, but assumes that marriage is the normal condition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - There is difference also, etc. The reading, punctuation, and exact sense are surrounded with uncertainty, which does not, however, affect the general meaning. This is probably given correctly in our English Version. He implies that the married woman must of necessity be more of a Martha than a Mary. Nevertheless, two things are certain:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that God intended marriage to be the normal lot; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that marriage is by no means incompatible with the most absolute saintliness.NEWLINENEWLINEIt is probable that most, if not all, of the apostles were married men (1 Corinthians 9:5). The spirit of St. Paul's advice - the avoidance of distraction, and the determination that our duty to God shall not be impaired by earthly relationships - remains eternally significant. Another common way of punctuating the words is, \"The married man cares.., how he may please his wife, and is divided [in interests].\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - For your own profit. My advice turns simply on questions of expedience. Not that I may cast a snare upon you. He does not wish to \"fling a noose\" over them to win them over to his own private views, and entangle them in rules which they might not be able to bear. That which is comely. Seemliness; \"the beauty of holiness\" (Romans 13:13). Without distraction. The phrases used in this clause make it probable that St. Paul had heard how Martha was \"anxious\" and distracted (περιεσπᾶτο) about much serving, while Mary sat at Jesus' feet (Luke 10:39-41).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Uncomely. If any father thinks, by keeping his virgin daughter unmarried, he is acting in a way which may cause sin or scandal, then let him permit her to marry her suitor. The word \"uncomeliness\" is terribly illustrated in Romans 1:27. (For \"comely,\" see 1 Corinthians 7:35; 1 Corinthians 12:24.) His virgin. Obviously a daughter or ward. Pass the flower of her age. If she be more than twenty years old, which the ancients regarded as the acme of the woman's life. And need so require. If there be some moral obligation or necessity in the case. Let them marry. The \"them\" means the virgin and her unmarried lover.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Steadfast. The general meaning of the verse is that the father, who, from high motives, remained unshaken in the resolve to dedicate his daughter (as Philip did) to the virgin life, doeth well, though neither Jews nor pagans thought so. Having no necessity. Because the maiden did not wish to marry or was not sought in marriage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Doeth well. Because\" marriage is honourable in all.\" Doeth better. Obviously not morally, because, if one course be morally better than another, we are bound to take it; but \"better\" with reference to expediency in \"the urgent necessity\" which rested on the Christian world in that day. It is quite clear that, if these words are meant to disparage matrimony in comparison with celibacy, or to treat celibacy in the abstract as a holier state that marriage, they have been set aside by the universal practice and theory of the Christian world. But, as we have seen, they are expressed by St. Paul only as a relative and diffident opinion. It is remarkable that not one word is said as to the choice of the virgin herself in the matter, which is one of the most essential points on which the decision must turn. St. Paul, no doubt, assumes the acquiescence or preference of the maiden as one of the elements in the absence of any \"need\" for her marriage; but also he writes after lifelong familiarity with the all but absolute control exercised by Jewish parents over their youthful daughters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Only in the Lord. The second marriage of the Christian widow must be a holy and a Christian marriage (2 Corinthians 6:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians7:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Happier.

I think also that I have the Spirit of God; rather, I think that I also, as well as the other teachers who have claimed spiritual authority for the rules they have given you about these subjects. The claim to authoritative decision is obviously less emphatic than it is in 1 Corinthians 14:37; still, it is an expression of personal conviction that he has the Spirit, not an implied doubt of the fact.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-13. - The relation of lore to knowledge with respect to the question of eating idol offerings. Verse 1. - As touching things offered unto idols. This was doubtless one of the questions on which the Corinthians had asked for advice. We judge from the tone of the questions to which St. Paul here replies that the majority of the Corinthians, being liberal in their views, held that it was a matter of perfect indifference to eat idol offerings; and that, in acting upon this conviction, they contemptuously overrode the convictions of those who could not help thinking that when they did so they committed a sin. The practical decision of the question was one of immense importance. If it were unlawful under any circumstances to eat idol offerings, then the Gentile convert was condemned to a life of Levitism almost as rigorous as that of the Jew. The distinction between clean and unclean meats formed an insuperable barrier between Jews and Gentiles. Wherever they lived, Jews required a butcher of their own, who had been trained in the rules and ceremonies which enabled him to decide and to ensure that all the meat which they ate should be clean (tahor), not unclean (tame). They could touch no meat which was not certified as free from legal blemish or ceremonial pollution by the affixed leaden seal on which was engraved the word \"lawful\" (kashar). But Gentiles had always been accustomed to buy meat in the markets. Now, much of this meat consisted of remnants of animals slain as sacrifices, after the priests had had their share. So completely was this case, that the word \"to sacrifice\" had come to mean \"to kill\" in Hellenistic Greek. Theophrastus, in his 'Moral Sketches,' defines the close-handed man as one who, at his daughter's wedding feast, sells all the victims offered except the sacred parts; and the shameless person as one who, after offering a sacrifice, salts the victim for future use, and goes out to dine with someone else. The market was therefore stocked with meat which had been connected with idol sacrifices. The Christian could never be sure about any meat which he bought if he held it wrong to partake of these offerings. Further than this, he would - especially if he were poor - feel it a great privation to be entirely cut off from the public feasts (sussitia), which perhaps were often his only chance of eating meat at all; and also to be forbidden to take a social meal with any of his Gentile neighbours or relatives. The question was therefore a \"burning\" one. It involved much of the comfort and brightness of ancient social life (Thucydides, 2:38; Aristotle, 'Eth.,' 7:9, § 5; Cicero, 'Off.,' 2:16; Livy, 8:32, etc.). It will be seen that St. Paul treats it with consummate wisdom and tenderness. His liberality of thought shows itself in this - that he sides with those who took the strong, the broad, the common sense view, that sin is not a mechanical matter, and that sin is not committed where no sin is intended. He neither adopts the ascetic view nor does he taunt the inquirers with the fact that the whole weight of their personal desires and interests would lead them to decide the question in their own favour. On the other hand, he has too deep a sympathy with the weak to permit their scruples to be overruled with a violence which would wound their consciences. While he accepts the right principle of Christian freedom, he carefully guards against its abuse. It might have been supposed that, as a Jew, and one who had been trained as a \"Pharisee of Pharisees,\" St. Paul would have sided with those who forbade any participation in idol offerings. Jewish rabbis referred to passages like Exodus 34:15; Numbers 25:2; Psalm 106:28; Daniel 1:8; Tobit 1:10, 11. Rabbi Ishmael, in 'Avoda Zara,' said that a Jew might not even go to a Gentile funeral, even if he took with him his own meat and his own servants. The law of the drink offering forbids a Jew to drink of a cask if anyone has even touched a goblet drawn from it with the presumed intention of offering little to the gods. Besides this, the Synod of Jerusalem had mentioned the eating of idol offerings as one of the four things which they forbade to Gentile converts, who were only bound by the Noachian precepts (Acts 15:29). But St. Paul judged the matter independently by his own apostolic authority. The decision of the synod had only had a local validity trod was inapplicable to such a community as that of Corinth. St. Paul had to suffer cruel misrepresentation and bitter persecution as the consequence of this breadth of view (Acts 21:21-24); but that would not be likely to make him shrink from saying the truth. This treatment of the subject closely resembles that which he subsequently adopted in Romans 14. We know that we all have knowledge. It is very probable that this is a semi-ironical quotation of the somewhat conceited remark which had occurred in the letter from Corinth. No doubt there was a sense in which it might (theoretically) be regarded as true; but it was St. Paul's duty both to disparage this kind of knowledge and to show that, after all, there were some among them who did not possess it (ver. 7). Knowledge puffeth up. The brief energetic clause, \"Knowledge puffeth up; love buildeth up,\" shows the strong feeling with which the apostle enters on the discussion. There is a wide distance between theoretic knowledge and heavenly wisdom (James 3:13-18). \"He who is full is rich; he who is puffed up is empty\" (Stanley). \"The first person puffed up was the devil\" (Beza). Charity edifieth. There is no reason whatever for the rendering of ἀγαπὴ sometimes by \"love,\" sometimes by \"charity.\" The fondness for variation which led King James's translators to do so only obscures the identity of thought which prevails among all the apostles respecting the absolute primacy of love as the chief sphere and test of the Christian life. Edifieth. Helps to build us up as stones in the spiritual temple (ch. 3:9; Romans 14:19; Ephesians 4:12). \"If because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love\" (Romans 14:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - If any man think that he knoweth anything. Humility is the test of true knowledge, and love the inevitable factor in all Christian knowledge. The conceit of knowledge is usually the usurped self assertion of an imaginary infallibility. We only know \"in part,\" and our knowledge, having at the best a purely relative value, is destined to vanish away (1 Corinthians 13:8). As he ought to know. True knowledge has in it an element of moral obligation, and saintliness is knowledge and supersedes the necessity for formal knowledge. Love is knowledge which has passed into heavenly wisdom. The student may say to the mystic, \"All that you see I know;\" but the mystic may retort,\" All that you know, I see.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if any man love God, the same is known of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If any man love God, the same is known of him. We should have expected the sentence to end \"the same knows him.\" St. Paul purposely alters the symmetry of the phrase. He did not wish to use any terms which would foster the already overgrown conceit of knowledge which was inflating the minds of his Corinthian converts. Further than this, he felt that \"God knoweth them that are his\" (2 Timothy 3:19), but that, since we are finite and God is infinite, we cannot measure the arm of God by the finger of man. Hence, although it is quite true that \"Every one that loveth is begotten of God and knoweth God\" (1 John 4:7), yet in writing to those whose love was very imperfect, St. Paul deliberately chooses the passive form of expression as in Galatians 4:9, \"Now that ye have known God or are rather known of God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - We know that an idol is nothing in the world. After his brief but pregnant digression on the nature of true knowledge, he returns to these questions, and probably once more quotes their own words. They had given this reason for open and public indifference with respect to meat offered to idols. With respect to idols, three views were possible to Christians: eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that they were \"demons\" - the spirits of deified dead men; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that they were evil spirits - a favorite view among the Jews (via 10:20; Deuteronomy 32:17; 2 Chronicles 11:15; Psalm 106:37; Revelation 9:20); orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that they were merely (lead images corresponding to nothing at all (Isaiah 44 etc.). That there is none other God but one. This belief is the signature of Judaism, according to their daily and oft repeated shema (Deuteronomy 6:4, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For though there be that are called gods. The verse is a limitation of the phrase which perhaps he had quoted from their letter. There are, indeed, demons, and there are created things, like the host of heaven and the powers of nature, which are called gods and pass for gods. Gods many, and lords many. Perhaps a passing allusion to the use of elohim, gods, for men in great positions, and to the habitual deification of Roman emperors even in their lifetime. The title \"Augustus,\" which they all had borne, was to Jewish ears \"the name of blasphemy\" (Revelation 13:1), implying that they were to be objects of reverence. Indeed, the worship of the Caesars was, in that strange epoch of mingled atheism and superstition, almost the only sincere cult that was left.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But to us. The \"but\" means \"nevertheless.\" We Christians only regard these \"gods,\" \"lords,\" and \"idols\" as nonexistent, except so far as they correspond to created and material things. The Father. Not only by creation and preservation, but much more by redemption and adoption, and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 8:15; Galatians 3:26). Of whom are all things. All things, even including the gods of the heathen, \"visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all firings were created by him and for him,... and by him all things consist\" (Colossians 1:16, 17). And we in him; rather, into or for him. He is the End and Goal as well as the Author of our existence. One Lord. The only real \"Lord,\" though the Roman emperors often took the title, and one of them - Domitian - insisted on the use of the expression, \"Dominus Deusque noster\" (\"Our Lord and God\"), as applied to himself (Suetonius. 'Domit.,' 13). By whom are all things. \"By whom,\" as the Agent of creation and redemption (John 1:3, 10; Hebrews 1:2). And we by him. \"By him,\"as the Mediator and the Giver of life (Romans 11:36, \"Of him, and to him, and through him are all things\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There is not in every man that knowledge. A correction of the somewhat haughty assertion of the Corinthians in ver. 1. With conscience of the idol; literally, by their consciousness of the idol. In eating meat offered to any god whom they had been accustomed to worship, \"being used to the idol,\" as the Revised Version renders it (reading \"by familiarity with,\" συνηθείᾳ for συνειδήσει) cannot dismiss from their minds the palatal sense that, in eating the idol sacrifice, they are participating in the idol worship. Their conscience being weak is defiled. Being Gentiles who till recently had been idolaters, the apparent participation in their old idolatry wore to them the semblance of apostacy. The thing which they were eating was, in its own essence, indifferent or clean, but since they could not help esteeming it unclean, they defied a conscientious doubt, and so their conduct, not being of faith, became sinful (Romans 14:14, 23). St Paul admits that this was the sign of a conscience intellectually weak; but the weakness was the result of past habit and imperfect enlightenment, and it was entitled to forbearance and respect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But meat commendeth us not to God; rather, will not recommend us. God would think none the better of them for eating idol sacrifices, even though they asserted thereby a freedom which was the reward of clear insight. This verse will serve to show why \"fasting\" is nowhere rigidly enjoined on Christians. If fasting is a help to our spiritual life, then we should practise it, but with the distinct apprehension of the truth that God will think none the better of us merely because we eat less, but only if the fasting be a successful means of making us more pure and more loving. If the Bible had been in the hands of the people during the Middle Ages, this verse would have rendered impossible the idle superstition that to eat meat in Lent was one of the deadliest sins, or that there was any merit whatever in the Lenten fast except as a means of self improvement and self mastery. This verse says expressly, \"We lose nothing by not eating; we gain nothing by eating.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Lest this liberty of yours become a stumbling block; rather, this power or right of yours. To lead any one to do that which he thinks to be wrong is to place a stone of stumbling in his way, even if we do not think the act to be wrong. For we make men worse if by our example we teach them to act in contradiction of their conscience. \"Let your motto be forbearance, not privilege, and your watchword charity, not knowledge. Never flaunt your knowledge, seldom use your privilege\" (Evans).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Sit at meat in the [an] idol's temple. To recline at a banquet in the temple of Poseidon or Aphrodite, especially in such a place as Corinth, was certainly an extravagant assertion of their right to Christian liberty. It was indeed a \"bowing in the house of Rimmon\" which could hardly fail to be misunderstood. The very word \"idoleum\" should have warned them. It was a word not used by Gentiles, and invented by believers in the one God, to avoid the use of \"temple\" (ναὸς) in connection with idols. The Greeks spoke of the \"Athenaeum,\" or \"Apolloneum,\" or \"Posideum;\" but Jews only of an \"idoleum\" - a word which (like other Jewish designations of heathen forms of worship) involved a bitter taunt. For the very word eidolon meant a shadowy, fleeting, unreal image. Perhaps the Corinthian Christians might excuse their boldness by pleading that all the most important feasts and social gatherings of the ancients were held in temples (comp. 1 Macc. 1:47 1 Macc. 10:83). Be emboldened; rather, be edified. The expression is a very bold paronomasia. This \"edification of ruin\" would be all the more likely to ensue because self interest would plead powerfully in the same direction. A little compromise and complicity, a little suppression of opinion and avoidance of antagonism to things evil, a little immoral acquiescence, would have gone very far in those days to save Christians from incessant persecution. Yet no Christian could be \"edified\" into a more dangerous course than that of defying and defiling his own tender conscience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall the weak brother perish. The fact that he was \"weak\" constituted a fresh appeal to pity. It made him more emphatically one of \"Christ's little ones,\" and Christ had pronounced a heavy malediction on all who caused such to offend. But if there is this \"ruinous edification\" upon the trembling and sandy foundation of a weak conscience, what could possibly follow but a gradual destruction? The tense is the present (the praesens futurascens), \"and he who is weak, in thy knowledge, is perishing\" - \"the brother for whose sake Christ died.\" The order of the original often gives a force to the words, which it is difficult to reproduce, as here. The word \"is perishing\" becomes very emphatic by being placed first in the sentence. \"Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died\" (Romans 14:16). Perish; terrificum verbum. Clarius. He could use no word which would more effectually point his warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And wound their weak conscience; rather, and in smiting their conseience which is weak. \"What,\" asks St. Chrysostom, \"can be more ruthless than a man who strikes one who is sick?\" Was it not a cowardly exercise of liberty to strike the conscience of the defenceless? It is another form of \"defiling\" (ver. 7) the conscience, but brings out the cruelty of such conduct. Ye sin against Christ. Because Christ lives and suffers in the persons of the least of his little ones (Matthew 25:40, 45; Romans 12:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Make my brother to offend. \"Make to offend\" is, in the original, the verb \"scandalize.\" The word for \"meat\" means any kind of food. Flesh. The particular subject of discussion here. \"I will,\" says St, Paul, \"abstain from flesh altogether rather than by eating it lead a weaker brother into sin.\" While the world standeth. The same expression is elsewhere rendered \"forever.\" Literally it means to the aeon. St. Paul is often led into these impetuous expressions of the depth of his feelings. The reader will find the whole question argued in s similar spirit in Romans 14:19-22. Lest; namely, in the case supposed. In reality there was no need for taking so severe a pledge of abstinence.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Cor.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAm I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-27. - The rights and the self denial of an apostle. Verses 1-14. - An apostle's right to maintenance. Verse 1. - Am I not an apostle I am I not free? The order of the best manuscripts is, Am I not free? am I not an apostle? St. Paul designed in this chapter to show that he was not only giving a precept, but setting an example, He told the \"strong\" Corinthians, who had \"knowledge,\" that they should be ready to abnegate their rights for the good of others, he now wishes to show them that, in a matter which affected his whole life, he had himself abnegated his own rights. Being free and an apostle, he could, if he had chosen, have claimed, as others had done, a right to be supported by the Churches to which he preached, he had thought it more for their good to waive this claim, and therefore he had done so at the cost (as appears in many other passages: 1 Corinthians 4:12; Acts 20:34; 1 Thessalonians 2:9) of bitter hardship to himself. But St. Paul practically \"goes off\" at the word \"apostle.\" It was so essential for him to vindicate, against the subterranean malignity of hostile partisans, his dignity as an apostle, that in asserting that authority he almost loses sight for the time of the main object for which he had alluded to the fact. Hence much that he says is of the nature of a digression - though an important one - until he resumes the main thread of his subject at 1 Corinthians 11:15. Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Doubtless he mainly refers to the vision on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:3, 17; 1 Corinthians 15:8), though he received other visions and revelations also (Acts 18:9; Acts 22:14, 18; 2 Corinthians 12:1, etc.). he had probably not seen Christ during his life on earth (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:73-75). The words are added to remind them that those who boasted of personal knowledge and relation with Jesus - perhaps the Christ party - had no exclusive prerogative. Are not ye my work in the Lord?

In 2 Corinthians 12:12 he refers to other proofs of his apostolic power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave we not power to eat and to drink?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - To eat and to drink. To be supported by those to whom we preach (Luke 10:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - To lead about a sister, a wife. There can be no doubt that this represents the true reading, and that the meaning is, \"We have power to lead about, that is, to travel in company with, some Christian sister to whom we are married, and who is supported at the expense of the Church.\" This plain meaning, however, involving the assertion that the apostles and desposyni (\"the Lord's brethren\") were married men, was so distasteful to the morbid asceticism which held celibacy in a sort of Manichaean reverence, that the scribes of the fourth, fifth, and later centuries freely tampered with the text, in the happily fruitless attempt to get rid of this meaning. They endeavoured, by putting the word in the plural or by omitting \"wife,\" to suggest that the women whom the apostles travelled with were \"deaconesses.\" Augustine, Tertullian, Ambrose, and others explain the verse of \"ministering women\" (Luke 8:2, 3). The false interpretation avenged itself on the bias which led to it. Valla adopts the wilful invention that the apostles, though married, travelled with their wives only as sisters. Such subterfuges have eaten away the heart of honest exegesis from many passages of Scripture, and originated the taunt that it is a \"nose of wax,\" which readers can twist as they like. It was the cause of such shameful abuses and misrepresentations that at last the practice of travelling about with unmarried women, who went under the name of \"sisters,\" \"beloved,\" \"companions,\" was distinctly forbidden by the third canon of the first Council of Nice. Simon Magus might unblushingly carry about with him a Tyrian woman named Helena; but apostles and true Christians would never have been guilty of any conduct which could give a handle to base suspicions. They travelled only with their wives. A sister. A Christian woman (1 Corinthians 7:15; Romans 16:1; James 2:15, etc.). A wife; i.e. as a wife. Other apostles. This is a positive mistranslation for \"the rest of the apostles.\" It might be too much to infer positively from this that every one of the apostles and desposyni were married; but there is independent evidence and tradition to show that at any rate most of them were. The brethren of the Lord. They are clearly and undeniably distinguished from the apostles. According to the Helvidian theory (to which the plain language of the Gospels seems to point), they were sons of Joseph and Mary. This is the view of St. Clement of Alexandria in ancient times, and writers so different from each other as De Wette, Neander, Osiander, Meyer, Ewald, and Alford, in modern. The theory of Jerome, that they were cousins of Jesus, being sons of Alphseus and Mary, a sister of the Virgin, is on every ground absolutely untenable, and it was half dropped even by St. Jerome himself, when it had served his controversial purpose. The theory of Epiphanius, that they were sons of Joseph by a previous marriage, is possible, but incapable of proof. It comes from a tainted source - the apocryphal Gospels (see my 'Early Days of Christianity,' 2). Cephas. St. Paul also uses the Aramaic name in Galatians 2:9. Peter's wife is mentioned in Matthew 8:14 and in the tradition of her martyrdom (Clem. Alex., 'Strom.,' 7. § 63).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And Barnabas. Like St. Paul, Barnabas was in every respect a genuine apostle, by the Divine call (Acts 13:2; Galatians 2:9), though not one of the twelve. He seems to have continued in his separate mission work the practice of independence which he had learnt from St. Paul. This allusion is interesting, because it is the last time that the name of Barnabas occurs, and it shows that, even after the quarrel and separation, Paul regarded him with love and esteem. To forbear working. To give up the manual labour by which we maintain ourselves without any expense to the Churches (Acts 18:3; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9). If, then, St. Paul toiled at the dull, mechanical, despised, and ill paid work of tent making, he did so, not because it was, in the abstract, his duty to earn his own living, but because he chose to be nobly independent, that the absolute disinterestedness of his motives might be manifest to all the world. For this reason even when he was most in need he would never receive assistance from any Church except that of Philippi, where he had at least one wealthy convert, and where he was beloved with a peculiar warmth of affection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Who goeth a warfare, etc.? In this and the following verses he adduces six successive arguments to prove the right of a minister to be supported by his congregation.NEWLINENEWLINE1. From the ordinary laws of human justice (ver. 7).NEWLINENEWLINE2. By analogy, from the Law of Moses (vers. 8-10).NEWLINENEWLINE3.

Analogy from the payment of soldiers (2 Corinthians 10:4). At his own charges. The word used for \"cost\" means literally rations (Luke 3:14; Romans 6:23). Planteth a vineyard. Analogy from the support of the vine dressers (Matthew 9:37). Feedeth a flock. Analogy from the support of shepherds (1 Peter 5:2). The two latter classes of labourers are paid in kind in the East to this day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Say I these things as a man? Am I relying exclusively on mere human analogies? The same phrase occurs in Romans 3:5; Galatians 3:13. Saith not the Law. The verbs used for \"say\" (λαλῶ) and \"saith\" (λέγει) are different: \"Do I speak [general word] these things as a man? or saith [a more dignified word] not the Law,\" etc.?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 25:4). He uses the same argument again in 1 Timothy 5:19. The mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn; rather, an ox while treading out the corn. The flail was not unknown, but a common mode of threshing was to let oxen tread the corn on the threshing floor. Doth God take care for oxen? Certainly he does; and St. Paul can hardly mean to imply that he does not, seeing that tenderness for the brute creation is a distinguishing characteristic of the Mosaic legislation (Exodus 23:12, 19; Deuteronomy 22:6, 7, 10, etc.). If St. Paul had failed to perceive this truth, he must have learnt it at least from Psalm 145:15, 16; Jonah 4:11. Even the Greeks showed by their proverb that they could pity the hunger of the poor beasts of burden starving in the midst of plenty. It is, however, a tendency of all Semitic idiom verbally to exclude or negative the inferior alternative. St. Paul did not intend to say, \"God has no care for oxen;\" for he knew that \"his tender mercies are over all his works:\" he only meant in Semitic fashion to say that the precept was much more important in its human application; and herein he consciously or unconsciously adopts the tone of Philo's comment on the same passage ('De Victim Offerentibus,' § 1), that, for present purposes, oxen might be left out of account. The rabbinic Midrash, which gave this turn to the passage, was happier and wiser than most specimens of their exegesis. St. Paul sets the typico allegorical interpretation above the literal in this instance (comp. 1 Timothy 5:18), because he regards it as the more important. It is a specimen of the common Jewish exegetic method of a fortiori or minori ad magus. Luther's curious comment is: \"God cares for all things; but he does not care that anything should be written for oxen, because they cannot read\"!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Altogether. It is probable that St. Paul only meant the word to be taken argumentatively, and not au pied de la lettre. This application (he says) is so obviously the right application, that the other may be set aside as far as our purpose is concerned. In the margin of the Revised Version it is rendered \"Saith he it, as he doubtless doth, for our sake?\" In hope. St. Paul's large experience of life, and his insight into character, sufficed to show him that despairing work must be ineffectual work. The spring and elasticity of cheerful spirits is indispensable to success in any arduous undertaking.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Life without hope draws nectar in a sieve,NEWLINEAnd hope without an object cannot live.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - If we. The we is in both clauses emphatic, to show that the argument applied directly to St. Paul's own case. Is it a great thing. An argument a fortiori. If ordinary labour is not undertaken gratuitously, is the spiritual labourer to be left to starve? St. Paul always recognized the rights of preachers and ministers, and stated them with emphasis (Galatians 6:6; Romans 15:27), although from higher motives he waived all personal claim to profit by the result of his arguments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - If others. St. Paul felt a touch of natural indignation at the thought that these Corinthians submitted to the extremest and haughtiest exactions from other teachers who had been loud in the statement of their own pretensions, while his own claims were shamefully disparaged, and he was even left, with perfect indifference, to suffer real privation. We shall find the full expression of his wounded sensibilities in 2 Corinthians 11:1-15. We have not used this power. This strong climax here asserts itself before the time. It anticipates ver. 15. Suffer. The same word, which also means \"to contain without leaking,\" is used in 1 Corinthians 13:7; 1 Thessalonians 3:1, 5. All things. Any amount of privation and distress. Hinder the gospel of Christ. By giving any handle for malicious misrepresentations as to our being self interested. The word for \"hindrance\" means etymologically \"cutting into,\" i.e. an impediment on a path, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They which minister about holy things. Jewish priests. He adds his two final arguments - since the right which he is pleading has its own intrinsic importance - before proceeding to the example which he set in order to prevail on the strong to give up their rights and their liberty, when need was, for the sake of the weak. Live; literally, eat, or feed. The Zealots used this excuse for themselves when they broke open the temple stores in the siege of Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:13, § 6). Of the things of the temple. They shared in the victims offered (see Numbers 18:8-13; Deuteronomy 18:1). Partakers with the altar. Only certain portions of certain victims were allowed them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Hath the Lord ordained (Matthew 10:10;.Luke 10:7). The reference has special interest, because it shows that St. Paul was at least orally familiar with the discourses of Christ. Indeed, there is nothing impossible or improbable in the supposition that some of these were already being circulated in manuscript. Should live of the gospel. If, that is, they desired and had need to do so. He does not say, \"to live of the altar,\" because Christians have no \"altar\" except in the metaphorical sense in which the cross is called an altar in Hebrews 13:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-23. - Self denying ordinance of St. Paul. Verse 15. - I have used none of these things. None of the forms of right which I might claim from these many sanctions. He is appealing to his own abandonment of a right to encourage them to waive, if need required, the claims of their Christian liberty. His object in waiving his plain right was that he might give no handle to any who might desire to accuse him of interested motives (1 Corinthians 9:4; Galatians 6:6, etc.). Have I written; rather, do I write; the epistolary aorist. That it should be so done unto me. Do not take my argument as a hint to you that you have neglected your duty of maintaining me, and have even seen me suffer without offering me your assistance. Better for me to die. Not \"to die of hunger,\" as Chrysostom supposes, but generally, \"I should prefer death to the loss of my independence of attitude towards my converts.\" Than that any man should make my glorying void. The Greek is remarkable. Literally it is, than my ground of boasting - that any one should render it void. Another reading is, better for me to die than - no one shall render void my ground of boasting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. -NEWLINENEWLINE1 have nothing to glory of. He is desirous to remove all appearance of haughtiness from his tone. There was, he says, no merit involved in his preaching the gospel. He did so from the sense of overwhelming moral compulsion, and he would have been miserable if he had tried to resist it. Necessity is laid upon me. \"We cannot but speak\" (Acts 4:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - If I do this thing willingly. The word rather means \"spontaneously;\" \"without compulsion.\" He was preaching willingly, but still it was in obedience to an irresistible behest (Acts 9:6, 15). I have a reward. The reward (or rather, \"wage \") of such self chosen work would be the power to fulfil it (comp. Matthew 6:1). Against my will; rather, involuntarily, \"under Divine constraint.\" A dispensation. He was appointed a \"steward\" or \"dispenser\" of the gospel, and could only regard himself at the best as \"an unprofitable slave,\" who had done merely what it was his bare duty to do (Luke 17:10). There is no merit in yielding to a must.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - What is my reward then? The answer is that it was not such \"wages\" as would ordinarily be considered such, but it was the happiness of preaching the gospel without cost to any. I abuse not; rather, I use not to the full, as in 1 Corinthians 7:31. It may be said that this was a ground of boasting, not a reward. It was, however, a point to which St. Paul attached the highest importance (1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Corinthians 11:7-12; Acts 20:33, 34), and he might therefore speak of it, though almost with a touch of half unconscious irony, as his \"fee.\" There is no need to adopt the construction suggested by Meyer: \"What is my reward? [none] that I may preach gratuitously;\" or that of Afford, who finds the reward in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For though I be free; rather, though I was free. He has voluntarily abandoned this freedom. The true rendering of the verse is, For being free from all men [Galatians 1:10], I enslaved myself to all. In acting thus he obeyed his own principle of not abusing his liberty, but \"by love serve one another\" (Galatians 5:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Unto the Jews I became as a Jew. When, for instance, he circumcised Timothy (Acts 12:3) and probably Titus also (Galatians 2:3; see 'Life of St Paul,' 1. 412, sqq.); and he was continuing this principle of action when he took the vow of the Nazarite (Acts 21:21-26), and called himself \"a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees\" (Acts 23:6). To them that are under the Law. That is, not only to Jews, but even to the most rigorous legalists among the Jews. It should be carefully observed that St. Paul is here describing the innocent concessions and compliances which arise from the harmless and generous condescension of a loving spirit. He never sank into the fear of man, which made Peter at Antioch unfaithful to his real principles. He did not allow men to form from his conduct any mistaken inference as to his essential views. He waived his personal predilections in matters of indifference which only affected \"the infinitely little.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - To them that are without law, as without law. In other words, I so far became to the heathen as a heathen (Romans 2:12), that I never wilfully insulted their beliefs (Acts 19:87) nor shocked their prejudices, but on the contrary, judged them with perfect forbearance (Acts 17:30) and treated them with invariable courtesy. St, Paul tried to look at every subject, so far as he could do so innocently, from 'their point of view (Acts 17.). He defended their gospel liberty, and had intercourse with Gentile converts on terms of perfect equality (Galatians 2:12). Not without law to God. Not even \"without law\" (anomos) Much less \"opposed to law\" (antiheroes), though free from it as a bondage (Galatians 2:19). The need for this qualification is shown by the fact that in the Clementine writings, in the spurious letter of Peter to James, St. Paul is surreptitiously calumniated as \"the lawless one.\" Even the Gentiles were \"not without law to God\" (Romans 2:14, 15). So that St. Paul is here using language which base opponents might distort, but which the common sense of honest readers would prevent them from misinterpreting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - To the weak. His whole argument here is a plea for condescension to the infirmities of weak converts. A similar condescension to their prejudices might be necessary to win them to Christianity at all (1 Corinthians 8:13; \"We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves,\" Romans 15:1). St. Paul often touches on our duties to weak brethren (1 Corinthians 8:7; Romans 14:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; Acts 20:35). All things to all men. He repeats the same principle in 1 Corinthians 10:33, \"I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved;\" and once more, at the end of his course (2 Timothy 2:10). This condescension laid him open to the malicious attacks of religious enemies (Galatians 1:10). But not on that account would St. Paul ever be led to abandon the fruitful aid of that universal sympathy and tolerance which is one of the best tests of Christian love. That I might by all means save some. He adds this explanation of the motive of his condescension to various scruples συγατάβασις) lest any should accuse him of men pleasing, as some of his Galatian opponents had done (Galatians 1:10). In his desire to win souls he acted with the wisdom and sympathy taught by experience, suppressing himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And this I do. The better reading is, and I do all things. For the gospel's sake. This is a wider feeling than even \"for the elect's sakes\" of 2 Timothy 2:10. With you. The \"you\" is not expressed in the original, where we only have \"a fellow partaker [συγκοινωνὸς, Romans 11:17] of it.\" But the word illustrates the deep humility of the apostle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-27. - Exhortation to earnestness as a corollary from the principles here stated. Verse 24. - Know ye not that they which run in a race run all? They as Corinthians would well know the full bearing of every illustration derived from the triennial Isthmian games, which were the chief glory of their city, and which at this period had even thrown the Olympic games into the shade. The words \"in a race,\" are rather, in the stadium. The traces of the great Corinthian stadium, where the games were held and the races run, are still visible on the isthmus. This metaphor of \"the race,\" which has pervaded the common language of Christianity, is also found in Hebrews 12:1; Philippians 3:14; 2 Timothy 4:7. The prize. The bracium was the wreath given to the victor by the judges. The Christian prize is that of \"the high calling of God in Jesus Christ,\" towards which St. Paul himself was pressing forward.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - That striveth for the mastery; rather, that strives to win in a contest. St. Paul never allows his converts to dream of the indefectibility of grace, and so to slide into antinomian security. He often reminds them of the extreme severity and continuousness of the contest (Ephesians 6:12 1 Timothy 6:12). Is temperate in all things. One good moral result which sprang from the ancient system of athleticism was the self denial and self mastery which it required. The candidate for a prize had to be pure, sober, and enduring (Horace, 'Ars Poet.,' 412), to obey orders, to eat sparely and simply and to bear effort and fatigue (Epict., 'Enchir.,' 35) for ten months before the contest. A corruptible crown. A fading garland of Isthmian pine, or Nemean parsley, or Pythian olive, or Olympian bay. An incorruptible; \"unwithering\" (1 Peter 2:4); \"amaranthine\" (1 Peter 5:4); \"a crown of righteousness\" (2 Timothy 4:8); \"a crown of life\" (James 1:12; Revelation 2:10; comp. also 2 Timothy 2:5; Revelation 3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Not as uncertainly. My eye is fixed on a definite goal (2 Timothy 1:12). So fight I (Romans 7:23; Ephesians 6:12; 2 Timothy 4:7); literally, so box 1. Not as one that beateth the air; rather, as not beating the air. Not what the Greeks called \"a shadow battle.\" I strike forthright blows, not feints, or blows at random.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Corinthians9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection; literally, I bruise my body, and lead it about as a slave. The word tamely rendered \"keep in subjection\" means literally, I smite under the eyes. The pugilistic metaphor is kept up, and the picturesque force of the words would convey a vivid impression to Corinthians familiar with the contests of the Pancratum, in which boxing with the heavy lead-bound caestus played a prominent part. The only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs is Luke 18:5, where it seems (on the lips of the unjust judge) to have a sort of slang sense. How St. Paul \"bruised his body\" may be seen in 2 Corinthians 6:4, 5; Colossians 3:5; Romans 8:13. It was not by absurd and harmful self torture, but by noble labour and self denial for the good of others. When I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. \"Lest\" - such is the meaning of the metaphor\" after proclaiming to others the laws of the contest (as a herald), I should myself violate those conditions, and be not only defeated as a combatant, but ignominiously rejected from the lists and not allowed to contend at all.\" The metaphor is not strictly adhered to, for the herald did not personally contend. No candidate could compete without a preliminary scrutiny, and to be \"rejected\" was regarded as a deadly insult The word \"rejected,\" \"reprobate\" - here rendered \"a castaway\" - is a metaphor derived from the testing of metals, and the casting aside of those which are spurious. That Paul should see the necessity for such serious and unceasing effort shows how little he believed in the possibility of saintly \"works of supererogation, over and above what is commanded.\" \"When the cedar of Lebanon trembles, what shall the reed by the brookside do?\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
