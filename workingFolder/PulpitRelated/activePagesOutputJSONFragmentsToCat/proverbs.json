"Prov.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-ch. 22:16. - Part III. FIRST GREAT COLLECTION (375) OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS. Verse 1-ch. 12:28. - First section. The sections are noted by their commencing usually with the words, \"a wise son.\" Verse 1. - The proverbs of Solomon. This is the title of the new part of the book; it is omitted in the Septuagint. There is some kind of loose connection in the grouping of these proverbs, but it is difficult to follow. \"Ordo frustra quaeritur ubi nullus fuit observatus,\" says Mart. Geier. Wordsworth considers the present chapter to contain exemplifications of the principles and results of the two ways of life displayed in the preceding nine chapters. The antithetical character of the sentences is most marked and well sustained. As the book is specially designed for the edification of youth, it begins with an appropriate saying. A wise son maketh a glad father. As wisdom comprises all moral excellence, and folly is vice and perversity, the opposite characters attributed to the son are obvious. The mother is introduced for the sake of parallelism; though some commentators suggest that as the father would be naturally elated by his son's virtues, which would conduce to honour and high estate, so the mother would be grieved at vices which her training had not subdued, and her indulgence had fostered. If this seems somewhat far-fetched, we may consider that the father in the maxim includes the mother, and the mother the father, the two being separated for the purpose of contrast (see on Proverbs 26:3). The word for heaviness occurs in Proverbs 14:13 and Proverbs 17:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTreasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Treasures of wickedness; treasures acquired by wrong doing (Micah 6:10). Profit nothing \"in the day of calamity\" (Ecclus. 5:8; comp. Proverbs 11:4). The LXX. renders, \"Treasures will not profit the wicked;\" so Aquila. \"For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?\" (Matthew 16:26). Righteousness (Proverbs 14:34); not simply justice and moral goodness, but more especially liberality, benevolence. So in Matthew 6:1 the Revised Version (in accordance with the best manuscripts) reads, \"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them,\" Christ proceeding to specify three outward acts as coming under this term, viz. almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In some analogous passages the LXX. renders the word by ἐλεημοσύντ, e.g. Psalm 111:9; Daniel 4:27; Tobit 12:9 (comp. 2 Corinthians 9:10). Delivereth from death, shows that a man's heart is right towards God. and calls down special grace. Such a man lays up in store for himself a good foundation, that he may attain eternal life (1 Timothy 6:19; see on Proverbs 16:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish (comp. Proverbs 19:23). The soul is the life (comp. Proverbs 13:25). So the psalmist says (Psalm 37:25), \"I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.\" Christ speaks of the providence that watches over the lower creatures, and draws thence a lesson of trust in his care of man. concluding, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matthew 6:26, 33). But he casteth away the substance of the wicked; Septuagint, \"He will overthrew the life of the wicked;\" Vulgate, \"He overturns the plots of sinners.\" The word rendered \"substance\" (havvah) is better understood as \"desire.\" God frustrates the eager longing (for food or other good things) of the wicked; they are never satisfied, and get no real enjoyment out of what they crave (comp. Proverbs 13:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - That dealeth with a stack hand; that is lazy and indolent (comp. Proverbs 6:10, 11; see on Proverbs 19:15). The Septuagint, with a different pointing, reads, \"Poverty humbleth a man.\" The hand of the diligent (Proverbs 12:24) maketh rich. The words for \"hand\" are different in the two clauses as Wordsworth remarks. The first word is caph, the open, ineffective, hand or palm; the second term is yad, the hand tense and braced for vigorous work. The LXX. introduces a clause here which seems to interfere with the connection: Υίος πεπαιοευμένος σοφὸς ἔσται τῷ δὲ ἄφρονι διακόνῳ, χρήσεται, \"A well instructed son will be wise. and he will use a fool as his minister;\" i.e. he is aide to make even the foolish subserve his ends. The sentence is quoted by St. Augustine, 'De Civil Dei,' 16:2. The Vulgate inserts another paragraph, which is also found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint at Proverbs 9:12: Qui nititur mendaciis, hic pascit ventos; idem autem ipse sequitur aves volantes, \"He who relieth on lies feedeth on the winds, and pursueth flying birds.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He that gathereth the harvest into the barn at the right season. The idea of husbandry is continued from the preceding verse. Son is here equivalent to \"man,\" the maxim being addressed to the young. That sleepeth; literally, that snoreth; Vulgate, qui stertit (Judges 4:21). A son that causeth shame. The phrase is found in Proverbs 17:2; Proverbs 19:26; Proverbs 29:15. The Septuagint has, \"The son of understanding is saved from the heat; but the sinful son is blasted by the wind in harvest.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. So Ver. 11. This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (Leviticus 13:45; Micah 3:7), reducing him to shame and silence. Others, again, consider the signification to be - in default of the good, honest words which should proceed from a man's mouth, the sinner pours forth injustice and wickedness. But it is best (as in Ver. 14) to take \"mouth\" as the subject: \"The mouth of the wicked concealeth violence,\" that he may wait for the opportunity of practising it. The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil. The Vulgate and Septuagint give, \"the blessing of the Lord.\" For \"violence\" the Septuagint has πένθος ἄωρον, \"untimely grief;\" the Hebrew word chamas bearing also the sense of \"misery.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The memory. The lasting, fragrant perfume of a holy life is contrasted with the noisomeness and quick decay of an evil name (comp. Psalm 72:17). As a commentator asks, \"Who ever thinks of calling a child Judas or Nero?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Will receive commandments. The wise in heart is not proud or conceited: he accepts the Divine Law with all its directions (observe the plural \"commandments\"), and is not above learning from others; at the same time, he makes no display of his wisdom. The fool of lips (ver. 10); one who is always exposing his folly. The literal antithesis is better shown by rendering \"the solid in heart,\" and \"the loose in lips.\" So Wordsworth. The Vulgate translates, \"The fool is chastised by his lips;\" i.e. the folly which he has uttered falls back upon him, and causes him to suffer punishment. The LXX. renders the last clause, \"He who is given to prating (ἄστεγος χείλεσι), walking tortuously, shall be tripped up.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He that walketh uprightly (Proverbs 2:7); Vulgate and Septuagint, \"in simplicity,\" having nothing to conceal or to fear. So Christ enjoins his followers to be guileless as children, and harmless as doves (Matthew 10:16; Mark 10:15). Surely; equivalent to \"securely;\" ἀμερίμνως, Aquila, having no fear of inopportune exposure, because he has no secret sin. He that perverteth his ways; deals in crooked practices. Shall be known (Proverbs 12:16). He shall be exposed and punished, and put to open shame. Having this apprehension always present, he cannot walk with confidence as the innocent does. Hence the antithesis in the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He that winketh with the eye (Proverbs 6:13). This is a sign of craft, malice, and complicity with other wicked comrades. Ecclus. 27:22, \"He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil.\" Causeth sorrow (Proverbs 15:13). He causes trouble and vexation by his cunning and secrecy. A prating fool (as Ver. 8). The two clauses are intended to teach that the garrulous fool is even more certain to bring ruin on himself and others than the crafty plotter. The Septuagint and Syriac have changed the latter clause into a sentence supposed to be more forcibly antithetical, \"He who reproveth with boldness maketh peace.\" But there are sentences not strictly antithetical in this chapter, e.g. vers. 18, 22 (comp. Proverbs 11:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A well of life (Proverbs 13:14: 18:4). The good man utters words of wisdom, comfort, and edification. God himself is said to have \"the well of life\" (Psalm 36:9), and to be \"the Fountain of living waters\" (Jeremiah 2:13): and the holy man, drawing from this supply, sheds life and health around. The second clause should be takes as in Ver. 6, but the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence, the contrast being between the open usefulness of the good man's words and the harmful reticence of the malicious sinner. The Septuagint has, \"A fountain of life is in the hand of the righteous; but destruction shall cover the mouth of the wicked.\" This is explained to mean that a good man's words and actions tend to spiritual health; a bad man's words bring down sorrow and punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Hatred stirreth up strife (Proverbs 6:14). Love covereth all sins (Proverbs 17:9). The reference is primarily to the blood feud, the existence of which led to the establishment of the cities of refuge. Hatred keeps alive the old feeling of revenge, and seeks opportunities of satisfying it; but love puts aside, forgets and forgives all offences against itself. This sentiment comes very near the great Christian principle, \"Love covereth a multitude of sins\" (1 Peter 4:8; comp. 1 Corinthians 13:4; James 5:20). The Talmud pronounces, \"To love a thing makes the eye blind, the ear deaf;\" and the Arab says, \"Love is the companion of blindness.\" Septuagint, \"Love (φιλία) covereth all those who love not strife.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Wisdom is found (comp. Psalm 37:30). The man of understanding is discreet in speech, and does not cause trouble by rash or foolish words. A rod (Proverbs 19:29; Proverbs 26:3). A fool brings upon himself punishment by his insensate talk. Void of understanding; Hebrew, \"wanting in heart;\" Vulgate, qui indiget corde. The LXX. combines the two members into one proposition, \"He who putteth forth wisdom with his lips is a rod to chastise the man without heart.\" In the Hebrew conception the \"heart\" is the seat, not only of the passions and affections, but also of the intellectual faculties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Lay up knowledge; like a treasure, for use on proper occasions (Proverbs 12:23; Proverbs 14:33; comp. Matthew 7:6; Matthew 13:52). Is near destruction. \"Near\" may be an adjective, equivalent to \"imminent,\" \"ever-threatening.\" The versions are proximum est and ἐγγίζει. The foolish are always uttering carelessly what may bring trouble on themselves and others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - His strong city (Proverbs 18:11). Wealth is a help in many ways, securing from dangers, giving time and opportunity for acquiring wisdom, making one independent and free in action (Ecclesiastes 7:12; Ecclus. 40:25, etc.). The destruction of the poor is their poverty. The poor are crushed, exposed to all kinds of evil, moral and material, by their want of means. The word for poor is here dal, which implies weakness and inability to help one's self; the other word commonly used for \"poor\" is rash, which signifies rather \"impecuniosity,\" opposed to \"wealthy.\" So in the present passage the LXX. renders ἀσθενῶν, \"the feeble.\" The poor were but lightly regarded till Christ pronounced the benediction, \"Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God\" (Luke 6:20). The view of Theoguis ('Paraen.,' 177) will speak the experience of many -NEWLINENEWLINEΚαὶ γὰρ ἀνὴρ πενίῃ δεδμημένος οὔτέ τι εἰπεῖν Οὔθ ἕρξαι δύναται γλῶσσα δὲ οἱ δέδεταιNEWLINENEWLINE\"A man, by crushing poverty subdued,NEWLINECan freely nothing either say or do -NEWLINEHis very tongue is tied.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Tendeth to life (Proverbs 11:19). Honest labour brings its own reward in the blessing of God and a long and peaceful life. The fruit of the wicked. All the profit that the wicked make they use in the service of sin, which tends only to death (Romans 6:21). The due reward of honourable industry is contrasted with the gains obtained by any means, discreditable or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He is in the way of life (Proverbs 5:6). It is a way of life when a man keepeth instruction, taketh to heart what is taught by daily providences and the wisdom of experience. Such teachableness leads to happiness here and hereafter. Erreth (Jeremiah 42:20); not \"causeth to err,\" as in the margin, which weakens the antithesis. Septuagint, \"Instruction (παιδεία) guardeth the ways of life, but he who is unaffected by instruction goeth astray\" (comp. Hebrews 12:7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - This verse ought to be translated, He that hideth hatred is [a man] of lying lips, and he that uttereth slander is a fool. He who cherishes hatred in the heart must be a liar and a hypocrite, speaking and acting in a way contrary to his real sentiments; if he divulges his slander, he is a stupid fool, injuring his neighbour, and procuring ill will for himself. The LXX. reads, \"Just (δίκαια) lips conceal hatred;\" but probably δίκαια is an error for ἄδικα or δόλια, though Ewald defends it, and would alter the Hebrew to suit it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - There wanteth not sin; LXX., \"Thou wilt not avoid sin.\" Loquacity leads to exaggeration and untruthfulness, slander and uncharitableness (comp. Ecclesiastes 5:1-3; and Christ's and James's solemn warnings, Matthew 12:36; James 1:26; James 3:2, etc.). \"Speak little,\" says Pinart ('Meditations,' ch. 6.), \"because for one sin which we may commit by keeping silence where it would be well to speak, we commit a hundred by speaking upon all occasions\" (see on Proverbs 17:27), Another rendering of the passage gives \"By multitude of words sin does not vanish away;\" i.e. you cannot mend a fault by much talking. But this weakens the contrast, and the Authorized Version is correct. Is wise. St. James calls the reticent \"a perfect man\" (comp. Proverbs 13:3). \"This sentence of Scripture,\" says St. Augustine, in his 'Retractations,' \"I greatly fear, because my numerous treatises, I know well, contain many things, if not false, at any rate idle and unnecessary.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Choice (Proverbs 8:10, 19); tested, purified by fire; πεπυρωμένος, Septuagint. Is little worth; mere dross, in contradistinction to choice silver. So the tongue is contrasted with the heart, out of whose abundance it speaketh (Ecclus. 21:26, \"The heart of fools is in their mouth; but the mouth of the wise is in their heart\"). Septuagint, \"The heart of the godless shall fail (ἐκλείψει).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Feed many. The righteous by wise counsel teach, support, and guide others (Ecclesiastes 12:11; Jeremiah 3:15). So the clergy are the shepherds of their flocks (John 21:15; Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:2). The LXX. has a different reading, \"know high things.\" Fools die for want of wisdom. Far from \"feeding\" others, they bring ruin on themselves (Proverbs 5:23). Others translate, \"die through one who wanteth understanding;\" but if the Hebrew will bear this rendering, it is obvious that fools need no guide to their fall; their fate is a natural result. In this case the meaning must be that the foolish man involves others in destruction. But it is best to translate as the Authorized Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The blessing of the Lord. The Septuagint adds, \"upon the head of the righteous,\" as in Ver. 6. Not chance and luck, not even industry and labour, but God giveth the increase (Ecclesiastes 5:18, 19). He addeth no sorrow with it; i.e. with the Blessing. In acquiring and in using wealth thus blessed, the good man is contented and happy, while unsanctified fiches bring only trouble and vexation. But this seems rather feeble, and it is better to render, \"And a man's own labor addeth nothing thereto.\" A man's own work must not be regarded as an equal cause of prosperity with the favour of God. This sentiment is in accordance with Psalm 127:1, 2, \"Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it so he giveth unto his beloved in sleep\" - what others vainly labour for God giveth to the righteous without toil. The rendering of the clause, \"Trouble is of no avail without it,\" is scarcely warranted by the wording of the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - As sport. The wicked make their pastime and amusement in doing evil. A man of understanding hath wisdom. As thus put, the sentence is jejune. The Revised Version expresses the meaning better: \"And so is wisdom to a man of understanding;\" i.e. the wise man finds his refreshment in living a wise and prudent life, which is as easy and as pleasant to him as mischief is to the vicious. The wisdom intended is practical religion, the fear of God directing and showing itself in daily action. Septuagint, \"A fool doeth mischief in sport (ἐν γέλωτι), but wisdom produceth prudence for a man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - This verse is connected in thought with the preceding. The wicked, though he lightly carries on his evil practices, is troubled with the thought of the retribution which awaits him, and that which he fears shall come upon him (Proverbs 1:26; Job 3:25; Isaiah 66:4); Septuagint, \"The wicked is involved in destruction.\" The desire of the righteous. The righteous will desire only that which is in agreement with God's will, and this God grants, if not in this world, certainly in the life to come. The LXX. has, \"The desire of the just is acceptable.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - As the whirlwind passeth. According to this rendering (which has the support of the Vulgate) the idea is the speed with which, under God's vengeance, the sinner is consumed, as Isaiah 17:13; Job 21:18. But it is better to translate, as the LXX., \"when the whirlwind is passing,\" i.e. when the storm of judgment falls, as Christ represents the tempest beating on the ill-founded house and destroying it, while that which was built on the rock remains uninjured (comp. Proverbs 12:3; Matthew 7:25, etc.; comp. Wisd. 5:14, etc). Everlasting foundation (Ver. 30; Psalm 91; Psalm 125:1); like the Cyclopean stones on which Solomon's temple was built. It is natural to see here an adumbration of that Just One, the Messiah, the chief Cornerstone. The LXX. gives, \"But the righteous turning aside is saved forever.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Vinegar (Ruth 2:14; Psalm 69:21). As sour wine sets the teeth on edge. Septuagint, \"as the unripe grape is harmful to the teeth\" (Ezekiel 18:2). Smoke. In a country where chimneys were unknown, and the fuel was wood or some substance more unsavoury, the eyes must have often been painfully affected by the household fire. Thus lacrimosus, \"tear-producing,\" is a classical epithet of smoke (see Ovid, 'Metam.,' 10:6; Her., 'Sat.,' 1:5, 80). To these two annoyances is compared the messenger who loiters on his errand. The last clause is rendered by the LXX., \"So is iniquity to those who practise it\" - it brings only pain and vexation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The fear of the Lord prolongeth days. The premise of long life as the reward of a religious conversation is often found in our book, where temporal retribution is set forth (see Proverbs 3:2; Proverbs 9:11; Proverbs 14:27). Shall be shortened, as Psalm 55:23; Ecclesiastes 7:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The hope of the righteous shall be gladness. The patient expectation of the righteous is joyful, because it has good hope of being, and is, fulfilled. So the apostle (Romans 12:12) speaks, \"Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.\" Septuagint, \"Gladness delayeth for the just.\" The expectation of the wicked; that which the wicked eagerly hope for shall come to naught (Proverbs 11:7; Job 8:13; Psalm 112:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The way of the Lord; i.e. the way in which he has commanded, men to walk - the way of his commandments (Psalm 25:12; Psalm 119:27), that which the Pharisees confessed that Christ taught (Matthew 22:16). The Septuagint renders, \"the fear of the Lord,\" which practically gives the meaning. Or \"the Lord's way\" may be his moral government of the world. Strength; better a fortress (Ver. 15). Doing his simple duty, a good man is safe; for, as St. Peter says, \"Who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?\" (1 Peter 3:13). But destruction shall be; better, but it (the way of Jehovah) is destruction. The two effects of the Law of God are contrasted, according as it is obeyed or neglected. While it is protection to the righteous, it is condemnation and ruin to sinners (see on Proverbs 21:15) So Christ at one time calls himself \"the Way\" (John 14:6); at another says, \"For judgment I am come into this world\" (John 9:39); and Simeon declares of him (Luke 2:34), \"This Child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel\" (comp. 2 Corinthians 2:15, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The righteous shall never be removed (Proverbs 2:21; Proverbs 12:3, 21; Psalm 10:6; Psalm 37:29). This is in agreement with the temporal promise made to the patriarchs and often renewed, as in the fifth commandment. St. Paul says (1 Timothy 4:8), \"Godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.\" The wicked shall not inhabit (or, abide not in) the land. The punishment of exile was threatened upon the Jews for their disobedience, and they are still suffering this retribution (Leviticus 26:33; Deuteronomy 4:27; Isaiah 22:17). Christ gives the other aspect of God's moral government when he says (Matthew 5:5), \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Bringeth forth; as a tree produces fruit, and the fields yield their increase. The metaphor is common. Thus Isaiah (Isaiah 57:19) speaks of \"the fruit of the lips\" (comp. Hebrews 13:15 and Psalm 37:30, which latter passage occurs in the same connection as the present). The Septuagint renders, \"distilleth wisdom.\" So Song of Solomon 5:13, \"His lips are like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.\" The froward tongue (Proverbs 2:12, 14: 8:13, which speaks only what is perverse and evil). Shall be cut out; like a corrupt tree that cumbers the ground (Matthew 3:10; Luke 13:7). The abuse of God's great gift of speech shall be severely punished. \"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned\" (Matthew 12:36, 37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs10:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Know. A good man's lips are conversant with what is acceptable to God and man. Such a person considers what will please God and edify his neighbour, and speaks in conformity therewith. The LXX. has,\" The lips of the righteous distil graces;\" ἀποστάζει χάριτας, but probably the right verb is ἐπίσταται, which is found in some manuscripts. Speaketh frowardnsss; rather, knoweth, or is perverseness (comp.

The repetition of the injunctions of Deuteronomy 25:13, 14 and Leviticus 19:35, 36 points to fraud consequent on increased commercial dealings, and the necessity of moral and religious considerations to control practices which the civil authority could not adequately supervise. The standard weights and measures were deposited in the sanctuary (Exodus 30:13; Leviticus 27:25; 1 Chronicles 23:29), but cupidity was not to be restrained by law, and the prophets had continually to inveigh against this besetting sin (see Ezekiel 45:10; Amos 8:5; Micah 6:11). Honesty and integrity are at the foundation of social duties, which the author is now teaching. Hence comes the reiteration of these warnings (Proverbs 16:11; Proverbs 20:10). A just weight; literally, a perfect stone, stones having been used as weights from early times. So we read (2 Samuel 14:26) that Absalom weighed his hair \"by the king's stone\" (eben).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Then cometh shame (Proverbs 16:18: 18:12); literally, cometh pride, cometh also shame. Pride shall have a fall; self-assertion and self-confidence shall meet with mortification and disgrace in the end. \"Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased\" (Luke 14:11); \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall\" (1 Corinthians 10:12). Septuagint, \"Where violence (ὅβρις) entereth, there also dishonor.\" But with the lowly is wisdom. \"Mysteries are revealed unto the meek\" (Ecclus. 3:19, Complutensian; Psalm 25:9, 14). The humble are already rewarded with wisdom because their disposition fits them to receive grace and God's gifts (comp. Proverbs 15:33). Septuagint, \"The mouth of the humble meditateth wisdom.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The integrity - the simple straightforwardness - of the upright shall guide them in the right way, and give them success in their undertakings with the blessing of God (comp. ver. 5). Septuagint, \"the perfection of the straightforward\" (Proverbs 10:9). The perverseness (seleph); (Proverbs 15:4, and there only. Vulgate, supplantatio; Septuagint, ὑποσκελισμός, \"the tripping up,\" making others fall, putting a stumbling block in others' way. Transgressors; treacherous and deceitful. Such persons shall be caught in their own net (Psalm 35:8); they not only bring punishment on themselves when their evil designs are discovered and frustrated, but they ruin their moral nature, lose all sense of truth and right, and are rejected of God. This clause and the following verse are omitted in the Vatican and some other manuscripts of the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRiches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Profit not; afford no refuge (Proverbs 10:2). In the day of wrath (Proverbs 6:34), when God visits individuals or nations to punish them for sin (comp. Ecclus. 5:8). Such visitations are often spoken of (comp. Isaiah 10:3; Ezekiel 7:19; Zephaniah 1:15, 18, etc.). More especially will this be true in me great dies irae. Righteousness... death (see on Proverbs 10:2; and comp. Tobit 4:10 Tobit 12:9). The Septuagint here adds a sentence which is similar to ver. 10: \"When the righteous dieth he leaveth regret, but the destruction of the wicked is easy and delightsome (πρόχειρος καὶ ἐπίχαρτος).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The perfect; the upright and honest. Vulgate, \"simple;\" Septuagint, \"blameless.\" Shall direct - make straight or smooth - his way (Proverbs 3:6). The good man, not blinded by passion, follows a safe and direct path of life; but the wicked, led by his own evil propensious, and losing the light of conscience (John 11:10), stumbles and fails. Septuagint, \"Righteousness cutteth straight (ὀρθοτομεῖ) blameless paths, but ungodliness walketh in iniquity.\" Ὀρθοτομέω occurs in Proverbs 3:6, and nowhere else in the Septuagiut. St. Paul adopts the word in 2 Timothy 2:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - An emphatic reiteration of the preceding sentences. Naughtiness; \"strong desire,\" as Proverbs 10:3, which leads to sin (Proverbs 5:22; Micah 7:3). The indulgence of their passions destroys sinners. Septuagint,\" Transgressors are taken by lack of counsel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - His expectation; that which he hoped for and set his heart upon, worldly prosperity, long life, impunity, - all are cut off, and the moral government of God is confirmed, by his death (Psalm 73:17-19). (For \"the hope of the ungodly,\" see the forcible expressions in Wisd. 5:14.) Of unjust men; Vulgate sollicitorum; Septuagint, τῶν ἀσεβῶν. The word seems to mean \"vanities,\" i.e. \"men of vanity\" - abstract for concrete. Others translate, \"godless hope,\" or \"expectation that bringeth grief,\" or \"strong, self-confident men;\" \"men in the fulness of their vigour.\" But the rendering of the Authorized Version is well supported, and the two clauses are coordinate. The Septuagint, in order to accentuate the implied antithesis, has seemingly altered the text, and introduced a thought which favours the immortality of the soul, \"When a righteous man dieth, hope perisheth not; but the boast of the wicked perisheth\" (Wisd. 3:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Out of trouble; i.e. God is at hand to help the righteous out of straits (de angustia, Vulgate); or takes him away from the evil to come (Isaiah 57:1; Wisd. 4:10-14). Septuagint, \"escapeth from the chase.\" In his stead (Proverbs 21:18). The evil from which the righteous is saved fails upon the wicked. As Abraham says to Dives in the parable, \"He is comforted, but thou art tormented\" (Luke 16:25). Of this substitution many instances occur in Scripture. Thus Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai (Esther 7:10); Daniel's accusers were cast into the den of lions from which he was saved (Daniel 6:24; comp. Isaiah 43:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - An hypocrite (chaneph); simulator, Vulgate. So translated continually in Job, e.g. 8:13; 13:16, etc. Others take it to mean \"profane,\" \"godless.\" Such a man, by his falsehoods, insinuations, and slanders, destroys his neighbour as far as he is able (Proverbs 12:6). Septuagint, \"In the mouth of the wicked is a snare for fellow citizens.\" Through knowledge. By the knowledge which the just possess, and which they display by judicious counsel, peace and safety are secured. Septuagint, \"Knowledge affords an easy path (εὔοδος) for the just.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The city; any city. Ewald would argue that such language could not be used of the capital of the Jews till the times of Asa or Jehoshaphat. But what is to prevent the sentence being taken generally of any city or community? The Vatican manuscript of the Septuagint and some others give here only the first clause, \"In the prosperity of the righteous the city succeeds,\" adding from ver. 11, \"but by the mouths of the wicked it is overthrown\" (see on ver. 4; comp. Psalm 58:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - This verse gives the reason of the rejoicing on the two occasions just mentioned (comp. Proverbs 14:34; Proverbs 28:12). By the blessing of the upright; i.e. their righteous acts, counsels, sad prayers (Wisd. 6:24). By the mouth of the wicked. Their impious language and evil advice, bring ruin upon a city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor; uses words of contempt about his neighbour. Septuagint, \"sneers at his fellow citizens.\" The following clause indicates that contemptuous language is chiefly intended. Holdeth his peace. An intelligent man is slow to condemn, makes allowance for others' difficulties, and, if he cannot approve, at least knows how to be silent. Nam nulli tacuisse nocet nocet esse locutum. \"Speech is silver,\" says the proverb, \"silence is golden.\" Septuagint, \"A man of sense keeps quiet.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A tale-bearer. The word implies one who goes about chattering, gossiping, and slandering (Leviticus 19:16); Vulgate, qui ambulat fraudulenter; Septuagint, \"the man of double tongue.\" To such a man it is safe to trust nothing; he revealeth secrets (Proverbs 20:19). He that is of a faithful spirit; a steadfast, trusty man, not a gadder about; he retains what is committed to him (Ecclus. 27:16, \"Whoso discovereth secrets luseth his credit, and shall never find friend to his mind\"). Septuagint, \"He that is faithful in spirit [πνοῇ, as in Proverbs 20:27, where see note] concealeth matters.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellers there is safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Where no counsel is. The word properly means \"steersmanship,\" \"pilotage\" (Proverbs 1:5; Proverbs 12:5; Proverbs 24:6). So Vulgate, gubernator; Septuagint, κυβέρνησις, \"They who have no government fall like leaves,\" reading alim instead of am. In the multitude of counsellors (Proverbs 15:22; Proverbs 20:18; Proverbs 24:6). This would go to prove the superiority of a popular government over the despotism of a single ruler. But the caution of our homely proverb is net inopportune, \"Too many cooks spoil the broth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He that is surety for a stranger; or, for another (see Proverbs 6:1). Shall smart for it. \"Evil shall fall on him evilly who is surety.\" He that hateth suretyship; guaranteed, as the word implies, by the striking of hands in public (Proverbs 17:18). Vulgate, \"who is cautious of snares,\" especially of the insidious dangers that lurk in suretyship. Is sure; is at rest and has nothing to fear. There is no paronomasia in the Hebrew. The play on \"suretyship\" and \"sure\" in the Authorized Version is either accidental or was introduced with the idea of giving point to the sentence. The Septuagint translates differently, \"A wicked man doeth evil when he mixes with the righteous; he hateth the sound of safety (η΅χον ἀσφαλείας).\" This perhaps means that the fraudulent creditor deceives the good man who has stood security for him; and henceforward the good man cannot bear to hear immunity and safety spoken of (see note on Proverbs 20:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A gracious woman; a woman full of grace. Septuagint, εὐχάριστος \"agreeable,\" \"charming.\" The author is thinking of personal attractions, which, he says, win favour; but we may apply his expression to moral exeellences also, which obtain higher recognition. Retaineth... retain; better, obtain...win, as in Proverbs 29:23. The two clauses are parallel in form, not in sense, and imply that beauty is more effective than strength, and honour is better than wealth. The Septuagint takes a narrow view: \"A graceful woman bringeth glory to her husband.\" The last clause is rendered, \"The manly (ἀνδρεῖοι) are supported by wealth.\" Between the two clauses the LXX. and the Syriac introduce the following paragraphs: \"But a seat of dishonour is a woman that hateth righteousness. The indolent come to want wealth, but the manly,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The merciful man; the kind, loving man. Septuagint, ἀνὴρ ἐλεήμων. His own soul; i.e. himself. His good deeds return in blessings upon himself. \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\" (Matthew 5:7) Troubleth his own flesh; brings retribution on himself. Some commentators, comparing Ecclus. 14:5 (\"He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?\"), translate, \"He who does good to himself is a kind man to others, and he who troubles his own body will be cruel to others.\" The sentiment is quite untrue. Self-indulgence does not lead to regard for others; and a severe, ascetic life, while it encourages stern views of human weaknesses, does not make a man cruel and uncharitable. The Vulgate takes \"his own flesh\" to mean \"his neighbours,\" as Judah calls his brother Joseph \"our flesh\" (Genesis 37:27). But the parallelism confirms the Authorized Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A deceitful work; work that brings no reward or profit, belying hope, like \"fundus mendax\" of Horace, 'Od.,' 3:1, 30. The Septuagint has, \"unrighteous works,\" which seems a jejune rendering, and does not bring out the contrast of the sure reward in the second member (comp. Proverbs 10:2, 16). To him that soweth righteousness (Hosea 10:12; Galatians 6:8, 9). To \"sow righteousness\" is to act righteously, to live in such a way that the result is holiness. The \"reward,\" in a Jew's eyes, would be a long life in which to enjoy the fruits of his good conduct. We Christians have a better hope, which is, perhaps, adumbrated by this analogy: as the seed sown in the field does not produce its fruit till the time of harvest, so righteousness meets with its full recompense only in the great harvest at the end of all things. The Revised Version renders, The wicked earnnth deceitful wages: but he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward. This makes a good antithesis. The Septuagint renders the last clause, \"but the seed of the righteous is a true reward (μισθὸς ἀληθείας).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - This verse is not to be connected with the preceding, as in the margin of the Revised Version, \"so righteousness,\" etc., each couplet in these chapters being independent, the connection, such as it is, being maintained by the use of catchwords, such as \"righteous,\" \"wicked,\" \"upright,\" etc. As righteousness tendeth to life. The various uses of the first word כֵן (ken) have led to different renderings. The Authorized Version takes it for \"as;\" the Revised Version as an adjective: He that is steadfast in righteousness. It is, perhaps, better, with Nowack, to regard it as an adverb: \"He who is honestly, strictly, of righteousness, is to life.\" The meaning is plain: real, genuine righteousness hath the promise of this life and of that which is to come (1 Timothy 4:8). The LXX., reading בֵן (ben), translate, \"A righteous son is born for life.\" He that pursueth evil (Proverbs 13:21); Septuagint, \"the persecution of the impious,\" i.e. that which an impious man inflicts. But the Authorized Version is correct, and the clause means that he who practises evil brings ruin eventually on himself - a warning trite, but unheeded (comp. Proverbs 1:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They that are of a froward heart (Proverbs 17:20); Septuagint, \"perverse ways.\" The word means \"distorted from the right,\" \"obstinate in error.\" Upright in their way (Proverbs 2:21; Proverbs 29:27; Psalm 119:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Though hand join in hand (Proverbs 16:5); literally, hand to hand, which may be taken variously. The Septuagint and some other versions take the phrase in the sense of unjust violence: \"He who layeth hand upon hand unjustly;\" Vulgate, manus in manu, \"hand in hand,\" which is as enigmatical as the Hebrew. Some Jewish interpreters consider it an adverbial expression, signifying simply \"soon.\" Some moderns take it to mean \"sooner or later,\" as the Italian da mano in mano, or, in succession of one generation after another (Gesenius, Wordsworth). Others deem it a form of adjuration, equivalent to \"I hereby attest, my hand upon it!\" And this seems the most probable interpretation; assuredly the Divine justice shall be satisfied by the punishment of the wicked (comp. Psalm 37.). The Authorized Version gives a very good sense: \"Though hands be plighted in faith, and men may associate together in evil, the wicked shall not go unpunished\" (comp. Isaiah 28:15). St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25.) takes a very different view: \"Hand in hand the wicked shall not be innocent;\" for hand is wont to he joined with hand when it rests at ease, and no laborious employment exercises it. As though he were saying, \"Even when the hand rests from sinful deeds, yet the wicked, by reason of his thoughts, is not innocent\" (Oxford transl.). This exposition is, of course, divorced from the context. The seed of the righteous. This is not \"the posterity of the righteous,\" but is a periphrasis for \"the righteous,\" as in Psalm 24:6; Psalm 112:2, \"the generation of the righteous\" (comp. Isaiah 65:23). The climax which some see here - as if the author intended to say, \"Not only the good themselves, but their descendants also shall be delivered\" - is non-existent and unnecessary. Septuagint, \"But he that soweth righteousness shall receive a sure reward,\" which is another rendering of the second member of ver. 18. Shall be delivered; i.e. in the time of God's wrath (vers. 4, 23; Proverbs 2:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - This is the first instance of direct \"similitude\" in the book. As a jewel [a ring] of gold in a swine's snout. The greatest incongruity is thus expressed. Women in the East wore, and still sometimes wear, a ring run through the nostril, and hanging over the mouth, so that it is necessary to hold it up when taking food. Such a nezem Abraham's servant gave to Rebekah (Genesis 24:22; comp. Isaiah 3:21; Ezekiel 16:12). The Septuagint has ἐνώτιον, \"an earring.\" So is a fair woman which is without discretion; without taste, deprived of the faculty of saying and doing what is seemly and fitting. The external beauty of such a woman is as incongruous as a precious ring in the snout of a pig. Lesetre quotes an Arab proverb: \"A woman without modesty is food without salt.\" Whether swine in Eastern countries were \"ringed,\" as they are with us nowadays, is unknown; if they were thus treated, the proverb is still more vivid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - (Comp. Proverbs 10:28.) The desire of the righteous is only good. They want only what is just and honest, and therefore they obtain their wiches. The expectation of the wicked - that on which they set their hope and heart - is wrath (Proverbs 11:4), is an object of God's wrath. Other commentators, ancient and modern, take the clause to imply that the wishes of evil men, animated by wrath and ill temper, are only satisfied by inflicting injuries on others. Delitzsch would translate ebrah, \"excess,\" \"presumption,\" as in Proverbs 21:24. But the first interpretation seems most suitable (scrap. Romans 2:8, 9). The LXX., pointing differently, for \"wrath\" reads \"shall perish.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - There is that scattereth; that giveth liberally, as Psalm 112:99, \"He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy.\" And yet increaseth; becomes only the richer in wealth and more blessed by God (comp. Proverbs 19:17). Nutt quotes the old epitaph, \"What we spent, we had; what we saved, we lost; what we gave, we have.\" Experience proves that no one ultimately loses who gives the tithe of his income to God (see on Proverbs 28:27). There is that withholdeth more than is meet; i.e. is niggardly where he ought to be liberal. But the expression is best taken as in the margin of the Revised Version, \"that withholdeth what is justly due,\" either as a debt or as a proper act of generosity becoming one who desires to please God and to do his duty. But it tendeth to poverty. That which is thus withheld is no real benefit to him. it only inure, sos his want. Septuagint and Vulgate, \"There are who, sewing what is their own, make the more; and there are who, gathering what is another's, suffer loss.\" Dionysius Cato, 'Distich. de Mor.,' 54:4, 1 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Despice divitias, si vis animo esse beatus,NEWLINEQuas qui suscipiunt mendicant semper avari.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The sentiment of the preceding verse is here carried on and confirmed. The liberal soul; literally, the soul of blessings, the man that blesses others by giving liberally. Shall be made fat (Proverbs 13:4; Proverbs 28:25). The term is used of the rich and prosperous (Psalm 22:29). Septuagint, \"Every simple soul is blessed.\" He that watereth - benefits and refreshes others - shall be watered also himself; shall receive the blessing which he imparts. The Vulgate introduces another idea, Qui inebriat, ipse quoque inebriabitur, where the verb implies rather abundance than excess, as in Proverbs 5:19, etc. The Septuagint departs widely from the present text: \"A passionate man is not graceful\" (εὐσχήμων), i.e. is ugly in appearance and manner - a sentiment which may be very true, but it is not clear how it found its way into the passage. St. Chrysostom comments upon it in 'Hom.' 17, on St. John. There are some Eastern proverbs on the stewardship of the rich. When a good man gets riches, it is like fruit falling into the midst of the village. The riches of the good are like water turned into a rice field. The good, like clouds, receive only to give away. The rivers themselves drink not their water; nor do the trees eat their own sweet fruit, and the clouds eat not the crops. The garment in which you clothe another will last longer than that in which you clothe yourself. Who gives alms sows one and reaps a thousand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He that withholdeth corn. The practice reprehended is not confined to any one time or place. The avaricious have always been found ready to buy corn and other necessary articles of consumption when plentiful, and wait till there was dearth in the market or scarcity in the land, and then sell them at famine prices. Amos sternly reproves this iniquity (Amos 8:4, etc.). It is a sin against justice and charity, and it is said of him who is guilty of it, the people shall curse him (Proverbs 24:24). Such selfishness has often given rise to tumult and bloodshed, and has been punished in a signal manner. The legend of Bishop Hatto shows the popular feeling concerning these Dardanarians, as they were called by Ulpian ('Digest. Justin.,' 47:11.6). Such a one St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in 1 Cor.,' 39) calls \"a common enemy of the blessings of the world, and a foe to the liberality of the Lord of the world, and a friend of mammon, or rather his slave.\" The Septuagint gives a curious rendering: \"He who hohleth corn may he leave it for the peoples!\" i.e. may neither he nor his heirs be benefited by his store, but may it be distributed among others far and near! That selleth it; literally, that breaketh it, as it is said of Joseph when he sold corn to the Egyptians (Genesis 41:56; Genesis 42:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He that diligently seeketh good; literally, he that seeketh in the morning, as so often in Scripture, the phrase, \"rising early,\" implies unimpaired powers and diligence (Proverbs 27:14; Jeremiah 7:13, etc,). Procureth favour; better, seeketh favour; by his very act of striving after what is good, he is striving to do what may please and benefit others, and thus to please God. Vulgate, \"Well does he rise early who seeketh good.\" It - mischief - shall come unto him; the consequences of his evil life shall fall upon his end. Says an Indian proverb, \"When men are ripe for slaughter, even straws turn into thunderbolts.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - There are many expressions in this and the following verses which recall Psalm 1. He that trusteth in his riches shall fall (Proverbs 10:2; Psalm 49:6, 7; Psalm 52:7; Ecclus. 5:8). Wealth is of all things the most uncertain, and leads the heart astray from God (1 Timothy 6:17). As a branch; \"as a leaf\" (Psalm 1:8; Isaiah 34:4). The righteous grow in grace and spiritual beauty, and bring forth the fruit of good works. Septuagint, \"He who layeth hold on what is righteous [or, 'helpeth the righteous'] shall spring up (ἀνατελεῖ).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - He that troubleth his own house; he that annoys and worries his family and household by niggardliness, bad management, and captious ill temper. So the Son of Sirach writes (Ecclus. 4:30), \"Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantic (φαντασιοκοπῶν, 'suspicious') among thy servants.\" Septuagint, \"he who has no friendly intercourse (ὁ μὴ συμπεριφερόμενος) with his own house.\" Shall inherit the wind; he will be the loser in the end; no one will lend him a helping hand, and his affairs will fall to ruin. The fool - the man who acts thus foolishly - shall be servant to the wise of heart; to the man who administers his household matters in a better and more orderly manner (see on Proverbs 12:24). It is implied that the troubler of his own house shall be reduced to such extremity as to have to apply for relief to the wise of heart. The other side of the question is given by the Son of Sirach: \"Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service\" (Ecclus. 10:25). The prodigal in the parable prayed his father to make him one of his hired servants (Luke 15:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The fruit of righteousness (of the righteous) is a tree of life (Proverbs 3:18; Proverbs 13:12); lignum vitae, Vulgate. That which the righteous say and do is, as it were, a fruitful tree which delights and feeds many. A good man's example and teaching promote spiritual health and lead to immortal life. Septuagint, \"From the fruit of righteousness springeth a tree of life.\" And he that winneth souls is wise; rather, he that is wise winneth souls. The latter member is parallel to the former. He who gives men of the tree of life attracts souls to himself, to listen to his teaching and to follow his example. With this \"winning of souls\" we may compare Christ's promise to the apostles that they should \"catch men\" (Luke 5:10; comp. James 5:20). The Septuagint introduces an antithesis not found in our Hebrew text: \"But the souls of transgressors are taken untimely away.\" Ewald and others change the present order of clauses in vers. 29 and 30, thinking thus to improve the parallelism. They would rearrange the passage in the following way: \"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; but the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart; but he that is wise winneth souls.\" There is no authority whatever in the versions or older commentators for this alteration; and the existing arrangement, as we have shown, gives a very good sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth. Them are two ways of understanding this verse. The word rendered \"recompensed,\" שַׁלַַ(shalam), is a vox media, and can be taken either in a good or bad sense. So the meaning will be, \"The righteous meets with his reward upon earth, much more the sinner,\" the \"reward\" of the latter being, of course, punishment. But the versions lead to another interpretation, by which \"recompensed\" is rendered \"chastised;\" and the meaning is - if even the righteous shall be punished for their trespasses, as Moses, David, etc., how much more the wicked! The Septuagint, quoted exactly by St. Peter (1 Peter 4:18) has, \"If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Instruction; correction, discpline, which shows a man his faults, gives him a lowly opinion of himself, and opens his mind to receive knowledge, especially the knowledge of himself and of all moral obligations. Is brutish; is as insensible to higher aspirations, to regret for the past or hope of amendment, as a brute beast (comp. Proverbs 30:2). On this point St. Augustine is quoted: \"Quicumque corripi non vis, ex eo sane corripiendus es quia corripi non vis. Non vis enim tua tibi vitia demonstrari; non vis ut feriantur, fiatque tibi utilis dolor, quo medicum quaeras; non vis tibi tu ipse ostendi, ut cum deformem te vides, reformaturum desideres, eique supplices ne in illa remaneas foeditate\" ('De Corrept. et Grat.,' 5). Such conduct is unworthy of one who is possessed of an immortal soul and infinite capacity for progress and improvement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A good man. The word is general, the particular virtue intended being often modified by the context. In view of the contrast in the second clause, it means here \"pure,\" \"straightforward.\" having a heart free from evil thoughts. As the psalm says, \"Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart\" (Psalm 73:1). Obtaineth favour of the Lord (Proverbs 8:35); Septuagint, \"Better is he who findeth favour from the Lord.\" A man of wicked devices (Proverbs 14:17); one whose thoughts are perverse and artful. Will he - Jehovah - condemn; Vulgate, \"He who trusts to his imaginations doeth wickedly;\" Septuagint, \"A man that is a sinner shall be passed over in silence (παρασιωπηθήσεται).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A man shall not be established by wickedness. Man is metaphorically compared to a tree, especially the olive. Wickedness gives him no firm hold for growth or life (comp. Proverbs 10:25). The root of the righteous shall not be moved. The righteous are planted in a good soil, are \"rooted and grounded in love\" (Ephesians 3:17), and the root being thus well placed, the tree is safe, and brings forth much fruit (comp. ver. 12; Job 14:7-9). Vers. 4-12 contain proverbs concerning the management of a house and business.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A virtuous woman; one whose portrait is beautifully traced in ch. 31. The term is applied to Ruth (Ruth 3:11). The Vulgate renders, diligens; Septuagint, ἀνδρεία. The expression means one of power either in mind or body, or both. The same idea is contained in ἀρετὴ and virtus. Such a woman is not simply loving and modest and loyal, but is a crown to her husband; is an honour to him, adorns and beautifies his life, making, as it were, a joyous festival. So St. Paul (1 Thessalonians 2:19) calls his converts \"a crown of glorying.\" The allusion is to the crown worn by the bridegroom at his marriage, or to the garlands worn at feasts (comp. Song of Solomon 3:11; Isaiah 61:10; Wisd. 2:8). The Son of Sirach has much praise for the virtuous woman: \"Blessed is the man that hath a good (ἀγαθῆς) wife, for the number of his days shall be double. A virtuous (ἀνδρεία) woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace\" (Ecclus. 26:1, 2). She that maketh ashamed; \"that doeth shamefully\" (Proverbs 10:5; Proverbs 19:26); one who is a terrible contrast to the woman of strong character - weak, indolent, immodest, wasteful. Is as rottenness in his bones (Proverbs 14:30; Habakkuk 3:16). Such a wife poisons her husband's life, deprives him of strength and vigour; though she is made \"bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh\" (Genesis 2:23), far from being a helpmate for him, she saps his very existence. Septuagint, \"As a worm in a tree, so an evil woman destroyeth a man.\" Here again Siracides has much to say, \"A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees\" (Ecclus. 25:23). Thus runs a Spanish maxim (Kelly, 'Proverbs of All Nations') -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Him that has a good wife no evil in lifeNEWLINEthat may not be borne can befall;NEWLINEHim that has a bad wife no good thing in lifeNEWLINEthat chance to, that good you may call.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The thoughts of the righteous are right; literally, judgments; i.e. just and fair, much more then words and actions. St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25) takes another view, seeing in \"judgments\" the stings of conscience, and a rehearsal of the day of account. \"The righteous,\" he says, \"approach the secret chambers of the Judge in the recesses of their own hearts; they consider how smartly he smites at last, who long patiently bears with them. They are afraid for the sins which they remember they have committed; and they punish by their tears the faults which they know they have perpetrated. They dread the searching judgments of God, even in those sins which perchance they cannot discover in themselves. And in this secret chamber of inward judgment, constrained by the sentence of their own conduct, they chasten with penitence that which they have committed through pride\" (Oxford transl.). But the counsels of the wicked - which they offer to others - are deceit. The mere \"thoughts\" are contrasted with the mature, expressed \"counsels\" Septuagint, \"The wicked steer (κυβερνῶσι) deceits.\" (For \"counsels,\" see notes, Proverbs 1:5 and Proverbs 20:18.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The words of the wicked are to lie in wait - a lying in wait - for blood (see Proverbs 1:11). The wicked, by their lies, slanders, false accusations, etc., endanger men's lives, as Jezebel compassed Naboth's death by false witness (1 Kings 21:13). The mouth of the upright shall deliver them; i.e. the innocent whose blood the wicked seek. The good plead the cause of the oppressed, using their eloquence in their favour, as in the Apocryphal Story of Susannah, Daniel saved the accused woman from the slanders of the elders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The wicked are overthrown, and are not; or, overthrow the wicked, and they shall be no more. The verb is in the infinitive, and may be rendered either way; but the notion is scarcely of an overthrow. The Vulgate has, verte impios; i.e. change them a little from their previous state, let them suffer a blow from any cause or of any degree, and they succumb, they have no power of resistance. What the stroke is, or whence it comes, is not expressed; it may be the just judgment of God - temptation, trouble, sickness - but whatever it is, they cannot withstand it as the righteous do (see Proverbs 11:7). Some commentators see in the phrase the idea of suddenness, \"While they turn themselves round, they are no more\" (Proverbs 10:25; Job 20:5). Septuagint, \"Wheresoever the wicked turn, he is destroyed.\" The house of the righteous, being founded on a secure foundation, shall stand (Matthew 7:24, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - According to his wisdom. A man who gives practical proof of wisdom by life and character, whose words and actions show that he is actuated by high views, is praised and acknowledged by all (see on Proverbs 27:21). Thus we read of David, that he behaved himself wisely, \"and he was acceptable in the sight of all the people\" (1 Samuel 18:5). The Septuagint, taking lephi differently, renders, \"The mouth of the prudent is commended by men.\" He that is of a perverse heart; Vulgate, \"a vain and senseless man;\" Septuagint, \"one slow of heart (νωθροκάρδιος).\" One who takes distorted views of things, judges unfairly, has no sympathy for others, shall be despised.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This verse may be translated, Better is a man who is lightly esteemed and hath a slave, than he that boasts himself and lacketh bread; i.e. the man who is thought little of by his fellows, and is lowly in his own eyes, if he have a slave to minister to his wants (which all Orientals of even moderate wealth possess), is better off than one who boasts of his rank and family, and is all the while on the verge of starvation. \"Respectful mediocrity is better than boastful poverty.\" Ecclus. 10:27, \"Better is he that laboreth and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.\" But the words rendered, hath a slave, are literally, a servant to himself. So the Vulgate has, sufficiens sibi, \"sufficing himself,\" and the Septuagint, δουλεύων ἑαυτῷ, \"serving himself.\" And the expression implies attending to his own concerns, supplying his own wants. Hence the gnome means, \"It is wiser to look after one's own business and provide for one's own necessities, even if thereby he meets with contempt and detraction, than to be in real want, and all the time assuming the airs of a rich and prosperous man.\" This latter explanation seems most suitable, as it is not at all clear that, at the time the book was written, the Israelites of moderate fortune kept slaves, and the proverb would lose its force if they did not do so. Says a mediaeval jingle -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nobilitas morum plus ornat quam genitorum.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast. For \"regardeth,\" the Hebrew word is literally \"knoweth\" (Exodus 23:9); he knows what animals want, what they can bear, and treats them accordingly (comp. Proverbs 27:23). The LXX. translates \"pitieth.\" The care for the lower animals, and their kind treatment, are not the produce of modern sentiment and civilization. Mosaic legislation and various expressions in Scripture recognize the duty. God's mercies are over all his works; he saves both man and beast; he hateth nothing that he hath made (Psalm 36:6; Psalm 145:9; Jonah 4:11; Wisd. 11:24). So he enacted that the rest of the sabbath should extend to the domestic animals (Exodus 20:10); that a man should help the over-burdened beast, even of his enemy (Exodus 23:4, 5); that the unequal strength of the ox and the ass should not be yoked together in the plough (Deuteronomy 22:10); that the ox should not be muzzled when he was treading out the corn (Deuteronomy 25:4): that the sitting bird should not be taken from her little brood (Deuteronomy 22:6), nor a kid seethed in its mother's milk (Exodus 23:19). Such humane injunctions were perhaps specially needed at a time when man's life was little regarded, and animal sacrifices had a tendency to make men cruel and unfeeling, when their symbolical meaning was obscured by long familiarity. These enactments regarding animals, and the mysterious significance affixed to the blood (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:10-14), afforded speaking lessons of tenderness and consideration for the inferior creatures, and a fortiori taught regard for the happiness and comfort of fellow men. Our blessed Lord has spoken of God's ears of flowers and the lower creatures of his hand. But the tender mercies; literally, the bowels, regarded as the seat of feeling. The wicked cannot be supposed to have \"tender mercies;\" hence it is best to take the word in the sense of \"feelings,\" \"affections.\" What should be mercy and love are in an evil man only hard-heartedness and cruelty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A contrast between industry and idleness, repeated at Proverbs 28:19. He that tilleth his land. Agriculture was the first of industries, and always highly commended among the Jews, bringing a sure return to the diligent (Proverbs 10:5; Proverbs 20:4; Proverbs 27:18, 23-27; and Ecclus. 20:28). He that followeth after vain persons; rather, vain things; μάταια, Septuagint, empty, useless employments, profitless business, in contrast to active labour on the land. The Vulgate renders, qui sectatur otium, \"he who studieth ease;\" but the original, reikim, will not bear this meaning. Is void of understanding; he not only, as is implied, will be reduced to poverty, but shows moral weakness and depravity. The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a paragraph not found in our Hebrew text: \"He who takes pleasure (ὅς ἐστιν ἡδύς) in carouses of wine will leave disgrace in his strongholds (ὀχυρώμασι)\" (Isaiah 28:7, 8; Habakkuk 2:16). Probably this verse is derived from the following, with some corruption of the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Modern commentators have endeavoured to amend the text of this verse by various methods, which may be seen in Nowack's note on the passage; but the existing reading gives an appropriate sense, and alteration is not absolutely needed, though it is plain that the LXX had before them something different from the Masoretic text. The wicked desireth the net of evil men (Ecclesiastes 7:26), that he may use the means which they take to enrich themselves; or matsod may mean, not the instrument, but the prey - \"such booty as evil men capture;\" or yet again, the word may mean \"fortress,\" i.e. the wicked seeks the protection of evil men. So the Vulgate, Desiderium impii munimentum est pessimorum, \"What the wicked desire is the support of evil men,\" or, it may be, \"the defense of evil men,\" i.e. that these may be secured from suppression and interruption. Another interpretation, which, however, seems somewhat forced, is that \"the net\" is a metaphor for the judgment of God, which overtakes sinners, and into which they run with such blind infatuation that they seem to \"desire\" it, The safest explanation is the second one given above, which signifies that the wicked man seeks by every means to obtain the prey which he sees sinners obtain, and, as is implied, gets small return for his labour, does not advance his interests. But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. The root supplies the sap and vigour needed for healthy produce. Without any evil devices or plotting, the righteous gain all that they want as the natural result of their high principles. Another hindering is, \"He (the Lord) will give a root of the righteous,\" will enable them to stand firm in time of trial. Septuagint, \"The desires of the impious are evil; but the roots of the pious are in strongholds,\" i.e. are secure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips; rather, in the transgression of the lips is an evil snare (Proverbs 18:7). A man by speaking unadvisedly or intemperately brings trouble upon himself, involves himself in difficulties which he did not foresee. Often when he has spoken in order to injure others, the slander or the censure has redounded on himself (comp. Psalm 7:15, 16; Psalm 9:16). The just; the man who does not offend with his lips, avoids these snares. The Septuagint here introduces a couplet not found in the Hebrew: \"He who looketh gently (ὁ βλέπων λεῖα) shall obtain mercy; but he who frequents the gates [or, 'contends in the gates,' συναντῶν ἐν πύλαις] will harass souls.\" This seems to mean the man who is calm and considerate for others will himself be treated with pity and consideration (Matthew 5:7); but he who is a gossip, or a busybody, or litigious, will be always vexing his neighbours.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth (Proverbs 13:2; Proverbs 14:14; Proverbs 18:20). A man's words are like seeds, and if they are wise and pure and kindly, they will bring forth the fruit of love and favour and respect. Christian commentaters see here a reference to the day of judgment, wherein great stress is laid on the words (Matthew 12:37). Of a man's hands. That which a man has done, his kindly actions, shall meet with full reward (comp. Isaiah 3:10, 11; Matthew 25:35, etc.; Romans 2:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; i.e. in his own judgment (Proverbs 3:7: 16:2). The second clause is best translated, as in the Revised Version, \"But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel,\" distrusting his own unaided judgment, which might lead him astray (Proverbs 13:10; Proverbs 14:12; Proverbs 16:25; Proverbs 21:2; comp. Ecclus. 35:19; Tobit 4:18). Theognis, 221, etc. -NEWLINENEWLINEὍς τις τοι δοκέει τὸν πλησίον ἴδμεναι οὐδὲνNEWLINEἈλλ αὐτὸς μοῦνος ποικίλα δήνε ἔχεινNEWLINEΚεῖνός γ ἄφρων ἐστὶ νόου βεβλαμμένος ἐσθλοῦNEWLINEἼσως γὰρ πάντες ποικίλ ἐπιστάμεθαNEWLINENEWLINE\"Who thinks his neighbour nothing knows,NEWLINEAnd he alone can see,NEWLINEIs but a fool, for we perhapsNEWLINEKnow even more than he.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A fool's wrath is presently (\"in the day,\" αὐθημερόν) known. A foolish man, if he is vexed, insulted, or slighted, has no idea of controlling himself or checking the expression of his aroused feelings; he at once, in the same day on which he has been incensed, makes his vexation known. A prudent man covereth - concealeth - shame; takes no notice of an affront at the moment, knowing that by resenting it he will only make matters worse, and that it is best to let passions cool before he tries to set the matter right (comp. Proverbs 20:22; Proverbs 24:29). Christ's injunction goes far beyond this maxim of worldly prudence: \"I say unto you that ye resist not evil;\" \"Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other\" (Matthew 5:39; Luke 6:29); and it is certain that these maxims might be carried into practice much more than they are, even in the present state of society. Septuagint, \"A clever man (πανοῦργος; callidus, Vulgate) concealeth his own disgrace.\" Corn. a Lapide quotes a Hebrew proverb which asserts that a man's character is accurately discerned \"by purse, by cup, by anger;\" i.e. by his conduct in money transactions, under the influence of wine, and in the excitement of anger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He that speaketh - breatheth out fearlessly (Proverbs 6:19) - truth showeth forth righteousness. The truth always conduces to justice and right, not only in a matter of law, but generally and in all cases. Vulgate, \"He who speaks that which he knows is a discoverer of justice;\" Septuagint, \"A just man announces well proved assurance [or, 'the open truth'] (ἐπιδεικνυμένην πίστιν).\" A false witness showeth forth deceit (Proverbs 14:5, 25); exhibits his true character, which is fraud, treachery, and wrong doing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - There is that speaketh. The word implies speaking thoughtlessly, rashly; hence we may render, \"a babbler,\" \"prater.\" Such a one inflicts wounds with his senseless tattle. Like the piercings of a sword. The point of the simile is seen when we remember that the edge of the sword is called its \"mouth\" in the Hebrew (Genesis 34:26; Exodus 17:13, etc.; comp. Psalm 59:7; Psalm 64:3). The Greek gnome says -NEWLINENEWLINEἈλλ οὐδὲν ἕρπει ψεῦδος εἰς γῆρας χρόνουNEWLINENEWLINE\"A sword the body wounds, a word the soul.\" Vulgate, est qui promittit, which restricts the scope of the clause to the making of vain promises (Leviticus 5:4; Numbers 30:7-9), continuing, et quasi gladio pungitur conscientiae, \"And is pierced as it were by the sword of his conscience.\" where \"conscience\" is added to make the meaning plain. Such a man suffers remorse if he breaks his promise, or if, like Jephthah, he keeps it. The tongue of the wise is health; it does not pierce and wound like that of the chatterer, rather it soothes and heals even when it reproves (Proverbs 4:22; Proverbs 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The lip of truth shall be established forever. Truth is consistent, invincible, enduring; and the fact belongs not only to Divine truth (Psalm 117:2; Matthew 24:35), but to human, in its measure. Septuagint, \"True lips establish testimony,\" pointing the last word ad as ed. Is but for a moment; literally, while I wink the eye (Jeremiah 49:19; Jeremiah 50:44). Lying never answers in the end; it is soon found out and punished (Proverbs 19:9; Psalm 52:5). Septuagint, \"But a hasty (ταχύς; repentinus, Vulgate) witness hath an unjust tongue.\" One who gives his testimony without due consideration, or influenced by evil motives, readily fails into lying and injustice. With the latter half of the verse we may compare the gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEἈλλ οὐδὲν ἕρπει ψεῦδος εἰς γῆρας χρόνουNEWLINENEWLINE\"Unto old age no lie doth ever live.\" A lie has no legs, is a maxim of wide nationality; and \"Truth may be blamed, but shall ne'er be shamed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellers of peace is joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil; i.e. that give evil advice; such are treacherous counsellors, and their advice can only work mischief, not joy and comfort (see on Proverbs 3:29). But to the counsellors of peace (health and prosperity) is joy. They who give wholesome advice diffuse joy around. Vulgate, \"Joy attends them;\" Septuagint, \"They shall be glad;\" but the original signifies rather to cause joy than to feel it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - There shall no evil - mischief - happen to the just. The mischief (aven) intended is not misfortune, calamity, but the evil consequences that follow on ill-doing (Proverbs 22:8); from these the righteous are saved. Our Lord goes further, and says (Matthew 6:33), \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these (temporal) things shall be added unto you.\" Vulgate, \"Nothing that happens can make a just man sorrowful;\" for he knows it is all for the best, and he looks toward another life, where all seeming anomalies will be cleared up. Septuagint, \"The just man takes pleasure in naught that is unjust.\" The wicked shall be filled with mischief; rather, with evil, moral and physical (Psalm 32:10). The Old Testament takes a general view of God's moral government without regarding special anomalies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - (Comp.

He is not wont to utter unadvisedly what he knows, but waits for fitting opportunity, either from humility or wise caution. Of course, in some cases reticence is sinful. The LXX., reading the passage differently, renders, \"A prudent man is the seat of intelligence (θρόνος αἰσθήσεως).\" The heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness (Proverbs 13:16; Proverbs 15:2). A foolish man cannot help exposing the stupid ideas that arise in his mind, which he considers wisdom. Septuagint, \"The heart of fools shall meet with curses.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-28 speak of the means of getting on in life. Verse 24. - The hand of the diligent shall bear rule (Proverbs 10:4). For \"diligent\" the Vulgate has fortium, \"the strong and active;\" Septuagint, ἐκλεκτῶν, \"choice.\" Such men are sure to rise to the surface, and get the upper hand in a community, as the LXX. adds, \"with facility,\" by a natural law. But the slothful (literally, slothfulness) shall be under tribute; or, reduced to compulsory service, like the Gibeonites in Joshua's time, and the Canaanites under Solomon (Joshua 9:21, 23; 1 Kings 9:21). So Proverbs 11:29, \"The fool shall be slave to the wise;\" and an Israelite reduced to poverty might be made a servant (Leviticus 25:39, 40). The LXX., taking the word in another sense, translates, \"The crafty shall be for plunder;\" i.e. they who think to succeed by fraud and trickery shall become the prey of those who are stronger than themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHeaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Heaviness - care - in the heart of man maketh it stoop (Proverbs 15:13; Proverbs 17:22). Care brings dejection and despair; hence the Christian is bidden to beware of excessive anxiety, and not to perplex himself with solicitude for the future (Matthew 6:84; 1 Peter 5:7). A good word maketh it glad.NEWLINENEWLINEΛύπην γὰρ εὔνους οϊδεν ἰᾶσθαι λόγος.NEWLINENEWLINE\"A word of kindness grief's keen smart can heal.\" Septuagint, \"A word of terror disturbs the heart of a (righteous) man, but a good message will gladden him.\" The \"word of terror\" may be an unjust censure, or evil tidings. Says a Servian proverb, \"Give me a comrade who will weep with me; one who will laugh I can easily find.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour. This rendering has the authority of the Chaldee, and would signify that a good man is superior to others morally and socially, is more respected and stands higher, though his worldly position be inferior. But the clause is better translated, The just man is a guide to his neighbour, directs him in the right way; as the Syriac puts it, \"gives good counsel to his friend.\" Septuagint, \"The righteous wise man (ἐπιγνώμων) will be a friend to himself;\" Vulgate, \"He who regards not loss for a friend's sake is righteous,\" which is like Christ's word, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\" (John 15:13). Hitzig, Delitzsch, and others, reading differently, translate, \"A just man spieth out (or, looketh after) his pasture; i.e. he is not like the sinner, hampered and confined by the chain of evil habits and associations, but is free to follow the lead of virtue, and to go whither duty and his own best interests call him. This gives a very good sense, and makes a forcible antithesis with the succeeding clause. But the way of the wicked seduceth them; \"causes them, the wicked, to err.\" Far from guiding others aright, the wicked, reaping the moral consequences of their sin, drift hopelessly astray themselves. Before the last clause some manuscripts of the Septuagint add, \"But the judgments of the wicked are harsh; evils shall pursue sinners\" (Proverbs 13:21). The whole is probably a gloss.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The slothful man (literally, sloth) roasteth not that which he took in hunting. There is some doubt concerning the correct meaning of the word translated \"roasteth\" (חרך), which occurs only in the Chaldea of Daniel 3:27, where it signifies \"burned\" or \"singed,\" according to the traditional rendering. It seems to be a proverbial saying, implying either that a lazy man will not take the trouble to hunt, or, if he does hunt, will not prepare the food which he has taken in the chase, or that he does not enjoy it when he has gotten it. Others render, \"will not start his prey;\" or \"catch his prey,\" Septuagint; or \"secure his prey,\" i.e. will not keep in his net what he has caught, but carelessly lets it escape. The Vulgate renders, \"The cheat will gain no profit.\" The word rendered \"cheat,\" fraudulentus in the Latin, and δόλιος in the Greek, is the same as that rightly translated \"slothful\" (ver. 24). But the substance of a diligent man is precious; i.e. the substance which an honest, industrious man acquires by his labour is stable and of real value. This second clause, however, is variously translated, Revised Version, But the precious substance of men is to the diligent, or, is to be diligent; Delitzsch, \"Diligence is a man's precious possession;\" Septuagint, \"A pure man is a precious possession.\" The Authorized Version is probably erroneous, and the rendering should be, as Delitzsch and Nowack take it, \"But a precious possession of a man is diligence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs12:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - In the way of righteousness is life (comp. Proverbs 10:2). For the promise of temporal prosperity which the Jew saw in such passages as these we substitute a better hope. And in the pathway thereof - of righteousness - there is no death. Many combine the two words thus: \"no death,\" i.e. immortality; but examples of such combination are not forthcoming, and the anomaly is not necessitated by the failure of the usual rendering to afford an adequate sense. The Greek and Latin versions are noteworthy. Septuagint, \"The ways of the revengeful (μνησικάκων) are unto (אֶל, not אַל) death.\" St. Chrysostom refers ('Hom. 16 in Ephesians') to this rendering: \"He here speaks of vindictiveness; for on the spur of the moment he allows the sufferer to act in order to cheek the aggressor; but further to bear a grudge he permits not; because the act then is no longer one of passion, nor of boiling rage, but of malice premeditated. Now, God forgives those who may be carried away, perhaps upon a sense of outrage, and rush out to resent it. Hence he says, 'eye for eye;' and yet again 'The ways of the revengeful lead to death.\" Vulgate, \"A devious path leads to death\" - a path, that is, which turns aside from the right direction, a life and conversation which are alien from justice and piety. But both the Septuagint and the Vulgate have missed the right meaning of the words in question; derek nethibah, \"pathway.\" Many see in this verse a plain evidence that the writer believed in the immortality of the soul. We have reason to suppose that such was his faith, but it cannot be proved from this passage, though we may consider that he was guided to speak in terms to which later knowledge would affix a deeper interpretation (see Proverbs 14:32, and note there). It is Jesus Christ \"who hath brought life and immortality (ἀφθαρσίαν) to light through the gospel\" (2 Timothy 1:10). Writers in Solomon's time could speak only darkly about this sublime and comforting hope, though later, as in the Book of Wisdom and throughout most of the Apocryphal books, it formed a common topic, and was used as a reason for patience and resignation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-ch. 15:19. Second section in this collection. Verse 1. - A wise son heareth his father's instruction. The Authorized Version introduces the verb from the second member. The Hebrew is elliptical, \"A wise son, his father's discipline,\" i.e. is the object or the result of his father's education; he owes his wisdom to it. Septuagint, \"A clever (πανοῦργος) son is obedient to his father.\" But a scorner (Proverbs 1:22) heareth not rebuke; one who mocks at goodness and despises filial piety will not listen to reproof. Septuagint, \"A disobedient son is in destruction.\" Compare the case of Eli's sons, and their fate (1 Samuel 2:25; 1 Samuel 4:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth (Proverbs 12:14; Proverbs 18:20). By his kindly speech and wise counsels he shall gain the good will of his neighbours and the blessing of God. Schultens observes that the word rendered \"good\" (tob) means what is pleasant to taste and smell, while that translated \"violence\" (chamas) signifies literally what is crude and unripe. The soul of the transgressors shall eat violence (Proverbs 1:31). The Authorized Version introduces the verb from the first clause unnecessarily. The meaning of this rendering is that sinners, especially the treacherous, bring on themselves retribution; the injuries which they devise against others recoil on their own heads (Proverbs 10:6). The Hebrew is, \"The soul (i.e. the desire, or delight) of the perfidious (is) violence.\" Such men have only one thing at heart, viz. to wrong their neighbour, and to increase their own property by any, even nefarious, precedings. Septuagint, \"Of the fruits of righteousness the good man shall eat; but the lives of transgressors shall perish untimely.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He that keepeth (guardeth) his mouth keepeth his life (Proverbs 18:21; Proverbs 21:23; comp. Psalm 39:1; James 1:26). Thus the gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEἩ γλῶσσα πολλοὺς εἰς ὄλεθρον ἤγαγεν.NEWLINENEWLINE\"The tongue hath many to destruction led.\" And Ecclus. 28:25, \"Weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and bar for thy mouth. Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait.\" But he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction (Proverbs 10:14). The Vulgate paraphrases, \"He who is inconsiderate in speech shall experience evils;\" Septuagint, \"will terrify himself\" - will occasion to himself many terrible alarms and inflictions. Hence the psalmist prays, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my month; keep the door of my lips.\" So we have in the Danish, \"A silent man's words are not brought into court;\" and in the Spanish, \"Let not the tongue say what the head shall pay for;\" while the Italians tell us, \"The sheep that bleats is strangled by the wolf:\" and \"Silence was never written down\" (Kelly). (See on Proverbs 18:6; 20:19.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - (Comp. Proverbs 10:4.) The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing; literally, and nothing is there - he gains nothing (Proverbs 14:6; Proverbs 20:4). He has the wish, but not the will, and the empty wish without corresponding exertion is useless (Proverbs 21:25, etc.). Vulgate, \"The indolent wishers, and wishes not;\" he wishes for something, but he wishes not for the labour of getting it; he would like the result, but he hates the process by which the result is to be obtained. Septuagint, \"In desires every idle man is occupied;\" his mind is fixed wholly on aimless wishes, not on action. Shall be made fat (Proverbs 11:25); Septuagint, \"The hands of the valiant are fully occupied (ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Lying; Vulgate, verbum mendax; Septuagint, λόγον ἄδικον; literally, a word of falsehood. But debar, \"word,\" is used, like ῤῆμα in Hellenistic Greek, in a general sense for \"thing,\" i.e. the subject of speech. So here it is not only verbal lying that is meant, but every kind of deceit and guile. This naturally betrays itself by the speech, according to the proverb, \"Show me a liar, and I will show you a thief.\" A wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. The clause is variously translated. Vulgate, confundit et confundetur, \"causes shame to others and to himself.\" Septuagint, \"is put to shame, and shall not have licence of tongue (παῥῤησίαν).\" The Revised Version margin, \"causeth shame and bringeth reproach.\" Delitzsch, \"brings into bad odour (Genesis 34:30) and causes shame.\" Hitzig, \"behaveth injuriously and shamefully.\" The antithesis is best brought out by the rendering that marks the effect of the wicked man's \"lying;\" \"He brings disgrace upon others (who have trusted him or have been associated with him) and causes shame.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRighteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Righteousness keepeth (guardeth) him that is upright in the way; literally, uprightness of way, abstract for concrete, as in the second member, sin for sinner. Those who are good and innocent in the walk of life are preserved from evil, moral and material. Wickedness overthroweth the sinner; literally, sin \"Overthroweth,\" makes to slip. Vulgate, supplantet. The LXX. inverts the clause, \"Sin makes the impious worthless (φαύλους)\" (see Proverbs 11:3, 5, 6). The verse is omitted in many Greek manuscripts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing. \"Maketh\" may mean \"feigns.\" There are some who pretend to be rich while really they are poor (as Proverbs 12:9), and there are some who make themselves, i.e. pretend to be poor (as misers) while they have much wealth. The Vulgate elucidates this meaning by rendering, quasi dives and quasi pauper; and the Hebrew verbs confirm its correctness. The proverb in both members teaches one not to trust to appearances. Septuagint, \"There are who enrich themselves, having nothing; and there are who humble themselves amid much wealth.\" It is obvious that such a version lends itself to a Christian interpretation. The first clause reminds one of the rich fool who laid up treasure for himself, and was not rich toward God (Luke 12:21; comp. Revelation 3:17, 18). The second clause teaches that wealth expended in God's service makes a man rich in the treasury of heaven (Luke 12:21, 33). One who thus uses the means entrusted to him could be spoken of like St. Paul, \"as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things\" (2 Corinthians 6:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The ransom of a man's life are his riches. A rich man can save himself from many difficulties and dangers by the sacrifice of a portion of his wealth, e.g. when his money or his life is demanded by a robber; when men in authority make extortionate demands on pain of death; or when he has incurred extreme penalty by infringement of law (Exodus 21:22, 30). Spiritually discerned, the passage recalls Christ's injunction, \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles\" (Luke 16:9). The poor heareth not rebuke; has not to listen to (Job 3:18) threats from the covetous or abuse from the envious. He has nothing to lose, and no one can gain anything by interfering with him. So the poor man is at peace. \"A hundred men cannot rob one pauper.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The light of the righteous rejoiceth; laetificat, Vulgate. But the verb is intransitive, and means \"burn joyfully,\" bright and clear, as the sun rejoices as a strong man to run a race (Psalm 19:5). This light (or) is the grace and virtue which adorn the good man's life, and which beam through all his actions with a cheerful, kindly radiance (comp. Proverbs 4:18, 19). This is a true light, kindled in his heart by God, different from the lamp (ner) of the wicked, which is devised and lighted by themselves, and has no element of permanence, but soon shall be put out (Proverbs 24:20; comp. Proverbs 20:20; Job 18:5; John 1:8; John 5:35, where the distinction between \"light\" and \"lamp\" is maintained). The lamp of the wicked is the false show of wisdom or piety, which may glimmer and deceive for a time, but is ere long detected and brought to naught. There may be here an allusion to a common custom in the East. \"No house, however poor,\" says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land,' 1:117), \"is left without a light burning in it all night; the housewife rising betimes to secure its continuance by replenishing the lamp with oil. If a lamp goes out, it is a fatal omen\" (comp. 1 Kings 15:4; Jeremiah 25:10; Revelation 18:23). Septuagint, \"The light of the righteous is everlasting; but the light of sinners is quenched.\" Then is introduced a couplet not found in the Hebrew, of which the latter part is borrowed from Psalm 37:21 or Psalms 112:5, \"Crafty souls go astray in sins; righteous men show mercy and pity.\" The Vulgate inserts this paragraph after ver. 13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Only by pride cometh contention. Some render \"surely\" (raq) for only, as in Genesis 20:11. Others rightly translate, \"By pride cometh only, nothing but, contention.\" Vulgate, \"Between the proud disputes are always rife.\" One who is haughty and overbearing, or who is too conceited to receive advice, is sure to quarrel with others. Septuagint, \"An evil man with insult doeth evil.\" With the well advised is wisdom; those who are not, like the proud, above taking advice and following it, are wise (Proverbs 11:2; Proverbs 12:15). As the Vulgate puts it, \"They who do all things with counsel are directed by wisdom.\" The LXX., reading differently, has, \"They who know themselves are wise,\" which implies that the wise know their own weakness and imperfection, and hearken humbly to good counselNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; literally, wealth by a breath; i.e. wealth obtained without labour and exertion, or by illegitimate and dishonest means, is soon dissipated, is not blessed by God, and has no stability. Vulgate, \"riches acquired hastily;\" Septuagint, \"substance gotten hastily with iniquity.\" This makes the antithesis more marked, the contrast being between wealth gotten hastily and that acquired by diligent labour. Cito nata, cito pereunt, \"Quickly won, quickly gone\" (see on Proverbs 20:21; 21:5). Says the Greek maxim -NEWLINENEWLINEΜὴ σπεῦδε πλουτεῖν μὴ ταχὺς πένης γένῃNEWLINENEWLINE\"Haste not for wealth, lest thou be quickly poor.\" He that gathereth by labour; literally, with the hand, handful after handful. Vulgate, paulatim, \"little by little,\" by patient industry. Labor improbus omnia vincit. Septuagint, \"He that gathereth for himself with piety shall be increased.\" Then is added, \"A good man is merciful and lendeth,\" from Psalm 37:26. The Septuagint here uses the term εὐσέβεια, which is received in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles and St. Peter's, taking the place of the earlier phrase, φόβος Κυρίου,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. Delay in the accomplishment of some much-desired good occasions sinking of the spirits, languor, and despondence. Many refer this sentence to the impatient longing for heaven which holy men feel, such as we may read in 'De Imitatione,' 3:48, 49, and in the hymns, \"For thee, O dear, dear country;\" and \"We've no abiding city,\" etc. And St. Paul can exclaim (Romans 7:24), \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" (comp. Romans 8:23; Philippians 1:23). Septuagint, \"Better is he who taketh in hand to aid with all his heart, than he who promises and raises hopes\" (comp. James 2:15, 16). When the desire cometh - when the object of the longing is obtained - it is a tree of life (Proverbs 11:30); there are then no longer languor and despondence, but strength and refreshment and vigorous action. Septuagint, \"A good desire is a tree of life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed. \"The word\" is either the commandment of God (Deuteronomy 30:14), or warning and instruction. He who despises and neglects this word \"brings on himself destruction.\" Many good authorities take the latter verb in another sense, \"is pledged by it;\" as Revised Version in margin, \"maketh himself a debtor thereto,\" i.e. is still bound to fulfil his obligations to it; he cannot escape duty by ignoring or despising it, but is pledged to do it, and will suffer for its neglect. Hence Christ's injunction to agree with our adversary quickly while we are in the way with him (Matthew 5:25). Vulgate, \"He who disparages (detrahit) anything binds himself for the future.\" Septuagint, \"He who despises a thing (πράγματος, τάγματυς, 'a command') shall be despised by it.\" Virtus se contemnentem contemnit. He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded (Proverbs 11:31). The Vulgate rendering, \"shall live in peace,\" and that of the Septuagint, \"shall be healthful,\" are not so suitable. The \"fearing the commandment\" implies obedience to it; and reward is considered as fully pledged to obedience as punishment is to neglect. The Septuagint here adds a distich which Ewald regards as genuine, \"Unto a crafty son there shall be nothing good; but to a wise servant all actions shall prosper, and his way shall be guided aright.\" This is also found in the Vulgate of Proverbs 14:15. The Vulgate here inserts the paragraph found in the Septuagint at ver. 9 (q.v.), Animae dolosae errant in peccatis; justi autem misericordes sunt et miserantur.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The law (instruction) of the wise is a fountain of life (Proverbs 10:11), which has and imparts life (Ecclus. 21:13; Psalm 36:9). The rules and teaching of wise men are a source of life to those who follow them, so that they depart from the snares of death (Proverbs 14:27). Obedience to good teaching saves from many dangers, material and spiritual, especially from the snare of the devil (2 Timothy 2:26). With \"snares of death\" we may compare Psalm 18:5 and Horace's ('Carm.,' 3:24. 8)NEWLINENEWLINE\"Non mortis laqueis expedies caput.\" Septuagint, \"The fool shall perish by the snare.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGood understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Good understanding giveth favour (Proverbs 3:4); makes one acceptable to God and man. We are told of Christ that \"he increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man\" (Luke 2:52). As a good and wise man uses his gifts and graces properly, he wins higher favour from God, and kindles the love and respect of his fellow men. Alter this clause the Septuagint introduces that which occurs also in Proverbs 9:10, \"It belongs to a good understanding (διανοίας) to know the Law.\" The way of transgressors is hard; rough and rugged, leading to desolation, not to waters of comfort. Ecclus. 21:10, \"The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.\" Vulgate, \"In the way of scorners is an abyss;\" Septuagint, \"The ways of scorners end in destruction.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Every prudent man dealeth (worketh, acteth) with knowledge; i.e. with thought and deliberation, having previously well considered the bearings and issues of his plans. But a fool layeth open his folly; Revised Version, spreadeth out folly, as if exposing the wares of his shop (Proverbs 12:23; Proverbs 15:2). One works; the other talks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A wicked messenger falleth into mischief; misfortune, calamity (Proverbs 17:20). A messenger who is false to his employer shall be detected and punished. The LXX., reading melek for malak, renders, \"A rash king shall fall into evils.\" Such a one adopts inconsiderate measures, makes war unadvisedly, etc. A faithful ambassador (literally, an ambassador of faithfulness, Proverbs 25:13) is health. One who faithfully performs his errand is a source of comfort and satisfaction both to his employer and to those to whom he is sent. Septuagint, \"But a wise messenger shall deliver him\" - the king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPoverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction; correction, discipline. Nowack takes the two nouns as predicates: \"He that refuseth discipline is poverty and shame,\" i.e. they are his lot. Such a one indulges his own lusts and passions, is headstrong in pursuing his own plans, and thus dissipates his fortune and acquires the contempt of all good men. Septuagint, \"Discipline taketh away poverty and disgrace.\" He that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. To listen to rebuke and to profit thereby is a proof of humility and self-knowledge, which wins respect from others. Lesetre refers to Theodosius's submission to the sentence imposed upon him by St. Ambrose as a real honour and glory to him (comp. Proverbs 12:1; Proverbs 15:5, 32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The desire accomplished (comp. ver. 12). This is usually taken to mean the desire of what is good and honest, when it is fulfilled and realized, is a source of highest joy and comfort to the wise. Septuagint, \"The desires of the pious are sweet to the soul.\" But it is abomination to fools to depart from evil. The antithesis is not very obvious, but it may be: it is sweet to a good man to obtain his wish; but for a wicked man to leave, to abandon evil to which he clings so fondly, is a detestable alternative. Or the latter clause may mean that the wicked will not give up the evil which makes the satisfaction of their desire impossible. But it is best to take the first clause as a general statement, viz. the satisfaction of desire is pleasant to all men; then the latter member gives a special case and will signify, \"For the sake of this pleasure bad men will not give up their evil wishes and plans; they will pursue what they have set their heart upon because they hate the idea of foregoing their evil designs.\" Septuagint, \"The deeds of sinners are far from knowledge,\" i.e. from practical wisdom, prudence, and piety. The Vulgate introduces quite another thought, \"Fools abhor those who flee from evil.\" Compare the passage in Wisd. 2, concerning the sinner's hatred of the good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; or, according to the Khetib, walk with wise men, and thou shall be wise. Ecclus. 6:36, \"If thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.\" So the Greek maxim -NEWLINENEWLINEΣοφοῖς ὁμιλῶν καὐτὸς ἐκβήσῃ σοφός.NEWLINENEWLINE\"With wise conversing thou wilt wise become.\"NEWLINENEWLINEand Eurip., 'Rhesus,' 206 -NEWLINENEWLINEΣοφοῦ παρ ἀνδρὸς χρὴ σοφόν τι μανθάνεινNEWLINENEWLINE\"A man that's wise will thee true wisdom teach.\" A companion of fools shall be destroyed; literally, shall be broken, shall suffer moral ruin; Revised Version margin, \"shall smart for it.\" But the antithesis is not well brought out by this rendering: and as the word may bear the sense of \"doing ill\" as well as of \"suffering ill,\" the interpretation of the Vulgat. intimates the correct idea of the clause: \"The friend of fools shall turn out the same;\" \"He who associates with fools shall do evil.\" Septuagint, \"He who roams about with fools shall be known.\" \"Tell me your companions, and I will tell you what you are.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Talis quis esse putatur qualis ei est sodalitas.\" A Dutch proverb says, \"He that lives with cripples learns to limp;\" and the Spanish, \"He that goes with wolves learns to howl.\" We have a homely English proverb, \"He that lies down with dogs shall rise up with fleas;\" so the Orientals say,\" He that takes the raven for his guide shall light upon carrion.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Evil pursueth sinners. Sinners suffer not only the natural consequences of crime in external evil, injury to body, estate, reputation, etc. (Psalm 11:6), but also stings of conscience and remorse; even seeming prosperity is often a chastisement, and long impunity is only augmenting the coming retribution. As the shadow attends the substance, so guilt is attached to sin, and brings with it punishment. To the righteous good shall be repaid; or, he, Jehovah, shall repay good (comp. Proverbs 12:14); Revised Version, \"The righteous shall be recompensed with good.\" They shall have the answer of a good conscience, happiness here and hereafter. Septuagint, \"Good shall take possession of (or, overtake) the righteous.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children. This would be especially notable where a system of temporal rewards and punishments was expected and generally experienced. The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. Property unjustly acquired, or wickedly used, is taken from those who have it, and ultimately finds its way into better hands. They cannot keep it, and consequently cannot leave it to their children.NEWLINENEWLINE\"De male quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Ill-gotten wealth no third descendant holds.\" This has often been the fate of property obtained by the sacrilegious seizure of what was dedicated to God's service. For the general view of the clause, comp. Proverbs 28:8; Job 27:16, 17; Ecclesiastes 2:26; and the case of Jacob (Genesis 31:9), and the Israelites (Exodus 12:35, 36), when \"the righteous spoiled the ungodly\" (Wisd. 10:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMuch food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Much food is in the tillage (tilled ground) of the poor (Proverbs 12:11). The word rendered \"tillage\" (nir) means ground worked for the first time, and therefore that on which much labour is bestowed. Hence the Vulgate rightly renders, novalibus. It occurs in Jeremiah 4:3 and Hosea 10:12, where our version has \"fallow ground.\" The poor, but righteous man, who industriously cultivates his little plot of ground, secures a good return, and is happy in eating the labour of his hands (Psalm 128:2). Intend of \"the poor,\" the Vulgate has, \"the fathers,\" taking ראשים in this sense; so that the meaning would be that children who properly cultivate their paternal or hereditary fields obtain good crops. But the Authorized Version rendering is doubtless preferable. There is that is destroyed for want of judgment; rather, as the Revised Version, by reason of injustice. Rich men are often brought to ruin by their disregard of right and justice (mishpat). Some (poor men) are amply supplied by honest labour; others (rich) lose all by wrong dealing. Vulgate, \"For others it (food) is gathered contrary to justice;\" Septuagint, quite astray, The righteous shall pass many years in wealth; but the unrighteous shall suddenly perish\" - which seems to be an explanation or amplification of ver. 22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He that spareth his rod hateth his son. Correction of children is a great point with our author (see Proverbs 19:18; Proverbs 22:15; Proverbs 23:13, etc.; Proverbs 29:15, 17). So Ecclus. 30:1, \"He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end.\" Dukes, \"Gold must be beaten, and a boy needs blows\" ('Rabbin. Blumenlese,' 71). Chasteneth him betimes; literally, early in the morning (Proverbs 1:28; Proverbs 8:17), which may mean, in the morning of life, ere evil habits have time to grow, or directly after the offence. Or the expression may signify \"diligently.\" Vulgate, instanter; Septuagint, ἐπιμελῶς.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul (comp. Proverbs 10:3; Psalm 34:10). The good man has always enough to satisfy his wants, because he is temperate, and his substance has the blessing of God. \"The chief thing for life,\" says Siracides (Ecclus. 29:21), \"is water, and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame.\" The belly of the wicked shall want. The wicked are punished by penury and desires never satisfied. These different results are providentially ordered.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Every wise woman buildeth her house.

A different pointing of the word translated \"wise\" (chakhmoth) will give \"wisdom\" (chokhmoth), which it seems best to read here, as the parallel to the abstract term \"folly\" in the second member. So we have, \"Wisdom hath builded her house\" (Proverbs 9:1; comp. Proverbs 1:20). Thus: \"The wisdom of women buildeth their house\" (Proverbs 12:4; Proverbs 24:3). But the foolish plucketh it down with her hands; \"but Folly plucketh it down with her own hands;\" of course, the folly of women is intended.NEWLINENEWLINEΓυνὴ γὰρ οἴκῳ πῆμα καὶ σωτηρίαNEWLINENEWLINE\"Bane or salvation to a house is woman.\" Foolish, unprincipled women, by their bad management or their evil doings, ruin their families materially and morally. \"The husband should labour,\" says a Servian proverb; \"the wife should save.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord. So the Septuagint. He who lives an upright life does so because he fears the Lord; and his holy conversation is an evidence that he is influenced by religious motives. The outward conduct shows the inward feeling. So he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him - the Lord. A man is evil in his actions because he has cast off the fear of God; and such wickedness is a proof that he has lost all reverence for God and care to please him. Delitzsch renders, \"He walketh in his uprightness who feareth Jahve, and perverse in his ways is he that despiseth him;\" i.e. the conduct of the two shows the way in which they severally regard God and religion, the former acting conscientiously and uprightly, the latter following his own lusts, which lead him astray. Either interpretation is admissible. Septuagint, \"He that walketh in crooked ways (σκολιάζων ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ) shall he dishonoured.\" The Vulgate gives quite a different turn to the sentence, \"He who walketh in the right way and feareth the Lord is despised by him who pursueth the path of shame.\" This intimates the hatred which sinners feel for the godly (comp. Job 12:4; and especially Wisd. 2:10-20; and our Lord's warning, John 15:18-21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride. חֹטֶר (choter), \"rod,\" or \"shoot,\" is found also in Isaiah 11:1. From the mouth of the arrogant fool proceeds a growth of vaunting and conceit, accompanied with insolence towards others, for which he is often chastised. So the tongue is compared to a sword (e.g. Psalm 57:4; Psalm 64:3; Jeremiah 18:18; Revelation 1:16. St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job.,' 24) applies this sentence to haughty preachers, who are anxious to appear superior to other people, and study more to chide and reprove than to encourage; \"they know how to smite sharply, but not to sympathize with humility.\" Septuagint, \"From the mouth of fools cometh a staff of insolence.\" The lips of the wise shall preserve them - the wise (Proverbs 13:3). These do not abuse speech to insult and injure others; and their words tend to conciliate others, and promote peace and good will (comp. Proverbs 12:6, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Where no oxen (cattle) are, the crib is clean. This does not mean, as some take it, that labour has its rough, disagreeable side, yet in the end brings profit; but rather that without bullocks to labour in the fields, or cows to supply milk - that is, without toil and industry, and necessary instruments - the crib is empty, there is nothing to put in the granary, there are no beasts to fatten. The means must be adapted to the end. Much increase is by the strength of the ox. This, again, is not an exhortation to kindness towards animals, which makes no antithesis to the first clause; but it is parallel with Proverbs 12:11, and means that where agricultural works are diligently carried on (the \"ploughing ox\" being taken as the type of industry), large returns are secured. Septuagint, \"Where fruits are plentiful the strength of the ox is manifest.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A repetition of Proverbs 12:17 (see also Proverbs 6:19). A faithful witness cannot be induced to swerve from the truth by threat or bribe. Will utter; Hebrew, breatheth forth. A false witness with no compulsion, as it were naturally, puts forth lies (comp. ver. 25; Proverbs 19:5). Septuagint, \" An unrighteous witness kindleth (ἐκκαίει) falsehood.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; literally, it is not - there is none (Proverbs 13:7). A scorner may affect to be seeking wisdom, but he can never attain to it, because it is given only to him who is meek and fears the Lord (Psalm 25:9). Wisd. 1:4, \"Into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is pledged to sin\" (comp. Psalm 111:10). True wisdom is not to be won by those who are too conceited to receive instruction, and presume to depend upon their own judgment, and to weigh everything by their own standard. This is especially true of the knowledge of Divine things, which \"scorners\" never really acquire. Septuagint, \"Thou shalt seek wisdom among the wicked, but thou shalt find it not.\" Knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth; \"that hath understanding,\" i.e. to the man who realizes that the fear of God is a necessary condition to the acquiring of wisdom, and who seeks it as a boon at his hands. This acquisition, as it is difficult, nay, impossible for the scorner, is comparatively easy for the humble believer who seeks it with the right temper and in the right way. \"Mysteries are revealed unto the meek\" (Ecclus. 3:19, in some manuscripts).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Go from the presence of a foolish man. There is some doubt about the rendering of this passage. The Vulgate gives, vade contra stultum, which is probably to be taken in the sense of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has, \"Go into the presence of a foolish man.\" The Hebrew מִנֶּגֶד (minneged) may mean \"from before,\" \"over against,\" \"in the presence of.\" Hence arises an ambiguity. The Authorized Version considers the sentence to be an injunction to turn away from a stupid man when you perceive that you can do him no good. The Revised Version is equivalent to \"if you go into the presence,\" etc. When thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge; Revised Version, and thou shalt not perceive in him, etc., which embodies a truism with no special point. The whole sentence is better translated, Go forth from the presence of a foolish man, and thou hast not known the lips of knowledge; i.e., as Nowack explains, \"Leave the presence of a fool, and you carry nothing away with you; after all your intercourse with him, you quit his presence without having gained any advance in true knowledge\" (see on Proverbs 20:15). The LXX. presents a very different version: \"All things are adverse to a foolish man; but wise lips are the arms of knowledge (αἰσθήσεως).\" A foolish man, by his inconsiderate, slanderous, or bitter words, makes every one his enemy; a wise man uses his knowledge to good purposes; his words are the instruments by which he shows what he is.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way. The wisdom of the prudent is shown by his considering whither his actions lead, the motives from which they spring, the results that attend them. As the apostle enjoins (Ephesians 5:15), \"See that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise.\" Or the clause may be taken as enjoining a wise choice in life, a selection of such a calling or occupation as best suits one's capabilities, station, and opportunities. The folly of fools is deceit. This is not self-deceit, which the word does not denote, but deceit of others. Stupid persons show their folly in trying to cheat others, though they are sure to be detected, and their fraud recoils on themselves. In the case of fools, what they would call wisdom is folly; hence the wording of the sentence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Fools make a mock at sin. So the Vulgate (comp. Proverbs 10:23). Fools, wicked men, commit sin lightly and cheerfully, give specious names to grievous transgressions, pass over rebuke with a joke, encourage others in crime by their easy way of viewing it. But in the original the verb is in the singular number, while the noun is plural, and the clause could be translated as in the Authorized Version only with the notion that the number of the verb is altered in order to individualize the application of the maxim ('Speaker's Commentary'). But there is no necessity for such a violent anomaly. The subject is doubtless the word rendered \"sin\" (asham) which means both \"sin\" and \"sin offering.\" So we may render, \"Sin mocks fools,\" i.e. deceives and disappoints them of the enjoyment which they expected. Or better, as most in harmony with the following member, \"The sin offering of fools mocks them\" (Proverbs 15:8). Thus Aquila and Theodotion, ἄφρονας χλευάζει πλημμέλεια, where πλημμέλεια may signify \"sin offering\" (Ecclus. 7:31). It is vain for such to seek to win God's favour by ceremonial observances; offerings from them are useless expenditure of cost and trouble (Proverbs 21:27). The Son of Sirach has well expressed this truth: \"He that sacrificeth of a thing unlawfully gotten, his offering is mockery (μεμωκημένη), and the mockeries of unjust men are not well pleasing. The Most High is not pleased with the offerings of the godless, neither is he propitiated for sin by the multitude of sacrifices\" (Ecclus. 31:18, 19). It is always the disposition of the heart that conditions the acceptableness of worship. Among the righteous there is favour - the favour and good will of God, which are bestowed upon them because their heart is right. The word ratson might equally refer to the good will of man, which the righteous gain by their kindness to sinners and ready sympathy; but in that case the antithesis would be less marked. Septuagint, \"The houses of transgressors owe purification (ὀφειλήσουσι καθαρισμόν); but the houses of the just are aceeptable.\" This is explained to signify that sinners refuse to offer the sacrifice which they need for their legal purification; but the righteous, while they have no necessity for a sin offering, are acceptable when they present their free will vows and thanksgivings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The heart knoweth its own bitterness; literally, the heart (leb) knoweth the bitterness of his soul (nephesh). Neither our joys nor our sorrows can be wholly shared with another; no person stands in such intimate relation to us, or can put himself so entirely in our place, as to feel that which we feel. There is many a dark spot, many a grief, of which our best friend knows nothing; the skeleton is locked in the cupboard, and no one has the key but ourselves. But we can turn with confidence to the God-Man, Jesus, who knows our frame, who wept human tears, and bore our sorrows, and was in all points tempted like as we are, and who has taken his human experience with him into heaven. A stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. The contrast is between the heart's sorrow and its joy; both alike in their entirety are beyond the ken of strangers. St. Gregory remarks on this passage ('Moral.,' 6:23), \"The human mind 'knoweth its own soul's bitterness' when, inflamed with aspirations after the eternal land, it learns by weeping the sorrowfulness of its pilgrimage. But 'the stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy,' in that he, that is now a stranger to the grief of compunction, is not then a partaker in the joy of consolation.\" A homely proverb says, \"No one knows where the shoe pinches so well as he that wears it;\" and an Italian maxim runs, \"Ad ognuno par piu grave la croce sua\" - \"To every one his own cross seems heaviest.\" Septuagint, \"The heart of man is sensitive (αἰσθητική), his soul is sorrowful; but when it rejoices, it has no intermingling of insolence;\" i.e. when a man's mind is sensitive it is easily depressed by grief; but when it is elated by joy, it should receive its pleasure and relief without arrogance and ribaldry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The house... the tabernacle. The house of the wicked, which they build and beautify and love, and which they look upon as a lasting home, shall perish; the hope which they founded upon it shall come to a speedy end (Proverbs 12:7); but the righteous rear only a tent on earth, as becomes those who are strangers and pilgrims; and yet this abode is more secure, the hopes founded upon it are more lasting, for it continues unto everlasting life. The text in its first sense probably means that sinners take great pains to increase their material prosperity, and to leave heirs to carry on their name and family, but Providence defeats their efforts: good men do their duty in their state of life, try to please God and benefit their neighbour, leaving anxious care for the future, and God prospers them beyond all that they thought or wished (comp. Proverbs 3:33). Shall flourish. The word applies metaphorically to the growth, vigour, and increase of a family under the blessing of God. Septuagint, \"The tents of the upright shall stand.\" There is a cognate proverb at Proverbs 12:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This verse occurs again in Proverbs 16:25. There is a way which seemeth right unto a man. This may refer to the blinding effects of passion and self-will; for these make a man think his own way best and most desirable. But it seems better to take it as a warning against following a perverted or uninstructed conscience. Conscience needs to be informed by God's Word and ruled by God's will to make it a safe guide. When properly regulated, it is able to pronounce a verdict upon contemplated action, and its verdict must always he obeyed. But warped by prejudice, weakened by disuse and disobedience, judicially blinded in punishment and in consequence of sin, it loses all power of moral judgment, and becomes inoperative of good; and then, as to the way that seemed at the moment right, the end thereof are the ways of death (Proverbs 5:5). The man is following a false light, and is led astray, and goes headlong to destruction (comp. Romans 1:28; 1 Timothy 4:2; see on ver. 13). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:12) has some words on this subject: \"There are times when we are ignorant whether the very things which we believe we do aright, are rightly done in the strict Judge's eye. For it often happens that an action of ours, which is cause for our condemnation, passes with us for the aggrandizement of virtue. Often by the same act whereby we think to appease the Judge, he is urged to anger when favourable Hence, while holy men are getting the mastery over their evil habits, their very good practices even become an object of dread to them, lest, when they desire to do a good action, they be decoyed by a semblance of the thing, lest the baleful canker of corruption lurk under the fair appearance of a goodly colour. For they know that they are still charged with the burden of corruption, and cannot exactly discern the things that be good\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful (comp. ver. 10). This recalls Lucretius's lines (4:1129) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Medio de fonte leporumNEWLINESurgit amari aliquid, quod in ipsis fioribus angat. The text is scarcely to be taken as universally true, but either as specially applicable to those mentioned in the preceding verse, or as teaching that the outward mirth often cloaks hidden sorrow (comp. Virgil, 'AEneid,' 1:208, etc.). And the end of that joy is bitterness; it has in it no element of endurance, and when it is past, the real grief that it masked comes into prominence. In this mortal life also joy and sorrow are strangely intermingled; sorrow fellows closely on the steps of joy; as some one somewhere says, \"The sweetest waters at length find their way to the sea, and are embittered there.\" Lesetre refers to Pascal, 'Pensees,' 2:1: \"Tous se plaignent...de tout pays, de tout temps, de tous ages, et de toutes conditions. Une preuve si longue, si continuelle et si uniforme, devrait bien nous convaincre de l'impuissance ou nous sommes d'arriver au bien par nos efforts: mais l'exemple ne nous intruit point... Le present ne nous satisfaisant jamais, l'esperance nous pipe, et, de malheur en malheur, nous meue jusqu'a la mort, qui en est le comble eternel. C'est une chose etrange, qu'il n'y a rien dans la nature qui n'ait ete capable de tenir la place de la fin et du bonheur de l'homme .... L'homme etant dechu de son etat naturel, il n'y arien a quoi il n'ait ete capable de so porter. Depuis qu'il a perdu le vrai bien, tout egalement peut lui paraitre tel, jusqu'a ea destruction propre, toute contraire qu'elle est a la raison et a la nature tout ensemble.\" This illustrates also ver. 12. Proverbs like \"There is no rose without a thorn\" are common enough in all languages. The Latins said, \"Ubi uber, ibi tuber;\" and \"Ubi mel, ibi fel.\" Greek experience produced the gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEΑρ ἐστὶ συγγενές τι λύπη καὶ βίος.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Sorrow and life are very near of kin.\" Who Christian learns another lesson, \"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted\" (Matthew 5:4). The LXX. has introduced a negative, which gives a sense exactly contrary to the Hebrew and to all the other versions: \"In joys there is no admixture of sorrow, but the final joy cometh unto grief.\" The negative has doubtless crept inadvertently into the text; if it were genuine, the sentence might be explained of the sinner's joy, which he finds for a time and exults in, but which does not last, and is felt to be a delusion as life closes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The backslider in heart - he who turns away from God (Psalm 44:18) - shall be filled with his own ways, shall reap the fruits of his evil doings (Proverbs 1:31; Proverbs 12:14). Matthew 6:2, \"Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\" And a good man shall be satisfied from himself. There is no verb expressed in this clause, \"shall be satisfied\" being supplied by our translators. Delitzsch and others read, \"and a good man from his own deeds.\" It is simpler to repeat the verb from the former clause: \"A good man shall be filled with that which belongs to him;\" i.e. the holy thoughts and righteous actions in which he delights. Isaiah 3:10, \"Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.\" The Vulgate, neglecting the prefix, translates, \"And over him shall be the good man;\" Septuagint, \"And a good man from his thoughts,\" the produce of his heart and mind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The simple believeth every word. \"Simple\" (pethi), the credulous person, open to all influences (Proverbs 1:22). The Vulgate has innocens, and the Septuagint ἄκακος; but the word is best taken in an unfavourable sense. The credulous fool believes all that he hears without proof or examination; having no fixed principles of his own, he is at the mercy of any adviser, and is easily led astray. Ecclus. 19:4, \"He that is hasty to give credit is light minded, and he that sinneth (thus) shall offend against his own soul.\" It is often remarked how credulous are unbelievers in supernaturalism. They who refuse to credit the most assured facts of Christ's history will pin their faith on some philosophical theory or insufficiently supported opinion, and will bluster and contend in maintenance of a notion today which tomorrow will prove untenable and absurd. Many who despise the miraculous teaching of the Bible accept the follies and frauds of spiritualism (comp. John 5:43). Hesiod, Ἔργ, 372 -NEWLINENEWLINEΠίστεις δ ἄρ τοι ὁμῶς καὶ ἀπιστίαι ὤλεσανNEWLINENEWLINE\"Belief and unbelief alike are fatal.\" Cato, 'Dist.,' 2:20 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Noli tu quaedam referenti credere semper;NEWLINEExigua his tribuenda fides qui multa loquuntur.' The prudent man looketh well to his going (ver. 8); Vulgate, Astutus considerat gressus suos. The prudent man considers whither the advice given will lead him, always acts with deliberation. This maxim is attributed to Pythagoras -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Let none persuade thee by his word or deedNEWLINETo say or do what is not really good;NEWLINEAnd before action well deliberate,NEWLINELest thou do foolishly.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Crus. Eph, 25, sqq.) Septuagint, \"The clever man (πανοῦργις) cometh unto repentance [or, 'afterthought'] (μετάνοιαν);\" i.e. if he, like the simpleton, is too credulous, he will smart for it. Μετάνοια, so common in the New Testament, is not found elsewhere in the Greek Version of the canonical Scriptures, though it occurs in Ecclus. 44:16; Wisd. 11:23, etc. The Vulgate here introduces the Septuagint addition in Proverbs 13:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil (Proverbs 22:3). In Proverbs 3:7 we had, \"Fear the Lord, and depart from evil;\" but here the idea is different. A wise man fears the evil that lurks in everything, and examines and ponders actions by the standard of religion, and is thus saved from many evils which arise from hastiness and inadvertence. The fool rageth, and is confident (Proverbs 21:24; Proverbs 28:26). The fool easily falls into a rage, and has no control over himself, and is confident in his own wisdom, in contrast to the wise man, who has trust in God, and is calm and thoughtful (Isaiah 30:15). Revised Version, \"beareth himself insolently, and is confident;\" but, as Nowack remarks, the word (mithabber), where it occurs elsewhere, means, \"to be excited,\" \"to be in a passion\" (comp. Proverbs 21:24; Proverbs 26:17; Psalm 78:21, 59, 62), and this usual signification gives a good meaning here. Vulgate, transilit, \"he overleaps\" all laws and restrictions. The LXX., by transposition of the letters, reads mithareh, and translates μίγνυται,\" The fool trusting to himself mixes himself up with sinners.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly. The contrast to the irascible, passionate man is seen in the man slow to anger (ver. 29; Proverbs 15:18). Such a one, in his haste and passion, does things which in calmer moments he must see are foolish and ridiculous. Says Euripides ('Hyp.,' Fragm.) -NEWLINENEWLINEἜξω γὰρ ὀργῆς πᾶς ἀνὴρ σοφώτεροςNEWLINENEWLINE\"Wiser is every man from passion freed.\" Be not angry, says the Talmud, \"and you will not sin.\" Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:37 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Ipse tibi moderare tuis ut parcere possis.\" And a man of wicked devices is hated. The contrast is not between the different ways in which the two characters are regarded, as that one is despised and ridiculed, and the other hated; but two kinds of evil are set forth in contradistinction, viz. hasty anger and deliberate plotting against others. Septuagint, \"The irascible man (ὀξύθυμος) acts without deliberation. but the prudent man endureth much.\" The Hebrew term, \"man of devices,\" being ambiguous, the LXX. takes it in a favourable sense, φρόνιμος; and they have a different reading of the verb.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The simple inherit folly.

The LXX. regards the simple as communicating their folly to others, and translates, \"Fools will divide malice.\" But the prudent are crowned with knowledge; put on knowledge as a crown of glory, in accordance with the Stoic saying, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' \"The wise is the only king.\" Nowack thinks the above translation and the idea alike belong to later times, and prefers to render, \"The prudent embrace knowledge,\" which is parallel to the sentiment of ver. 6. The word is found only in Psalm 142:8, where it is translated either \"shall compass me about\" or \"crown themselves through me.\" The Vulgate has expectabunt, i.e. \"wait for it patiently,\" as the fruit of labour and perseverance. Septuagint, \"The wise shall get possession of (κρατήσουσιν) knowledge.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The evil bow before the good; and the wicked stand at the gates of the righteous (Proverbs 8:34). The final victory of good over evil is here set forth. However triumphant for a time and apparently prosperous the wicked may be, their success is not lasting; they shall in the end succumb to the righteous, even as the Canaanite kings crouched before Joshua's captains (Joshua 10:24), and, hurled from their high estate, they shall stand humbly at the good man's door, begging for bread to support their life (1 Samuel 2:36). The contrast here indicated is seen in our Lord's parable of Dives and Lazarus, when the beggar is comforted and the rich man is tormented, and when the latter urgently sues for the help of the once despised outcast to mitigate the agony which he is suffering (comp. Wisd. 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The poor is hated even of his own neighbour (Proverbs 19:4, 7). This sad experience of selfishness (comp. Ecclus. 6:8, etc.; 12:8) is corrected by the following verse, which must be taken in connection with this; at the same time, it is a truth which has been expressed in various ways by many moralists and satirists. Says the Greek Theognis -NEWLINENEWLINEΠᾶς τις πλούσιον ἄνδρα τίει ἀτίει δὲ πενιχρόν.NEWLINENEWLINE\"The rich all honour, but the poor man slight.\" Says Ovid, 'Trist.,' 1:9. 6 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos;NEWLINETempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Prosperous, you many friends will own;NEWLINEIn cloudy days you stand alone.\" In the Talmud we find (Dukes, 'Rabb. Blum.'), \"At the door of the tavern there are many brethren and friends, at the poor man's gate not one.\" The rich hath many friends. Says Theognis again -NEWLINENEWLINEΑϋ μεν ἔχοντος ἐμοῦ πολλοὶ φίλοι η}ν δέ τι δεινονNEWLINEΣυγκύρσῃ παῦροι πιστὸν ἔχουσι νόον And again, a distich which might have been written today -NEWLINENEWLINEΠλήθει δ ἀνθρώπων ἀρετὴ μία γίγνεται ἥδεNEWLINEΠλουτεῖν τῶν δ ἄλλων οὐδὲν ἄρ η΅ν ὄφελοςNEWLINENEWLINE\"One only virtue you must needs possessNEWLINE(As say the most of men), and that is wealth;NEWLINEAll others are of small account.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth. Taken in connection with the preceding verse, this teaches that it is a sin to despise and shun a man because he is poor or of low estate; such a one has a claim for love and pity, and it is a crime to withhold them from him for selfish considerations. The Christian view is taught by the parable of the good Samaritan. But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he; hail to him! (Proverbs 16:20). Contempt is contrasted with mercy, sin with blessing. \"Blessed are the merciful,\" said Christ (Matthew 5:7): \"for they shall obtain mercy;\" and St. Paul preserves another precious word, \"It is mere blessed to give than to receive\" (Acts 20:35). The merciful disposition, which shows itself in works of mercy, is a proof that the soul is in union with God, whose mercy is over all his works, whose mercy endureth forever, and therefore such a soul is blessed. \"The poor,\" wrote James Howell, \"are God's receivers, and the angels are his auditors\" ('Five Hundred New Sayings'). The Vulgate here appends a line absent from the Hebrew and the ether versions, \"He who believeth in the Lord loveth mercy.\" The true believer is charitable and bountiful, knowing that he will not hereby impoverish himself, but lay up a rich store of blessing; he acts thus not from mere philanthropy, but from higher motives: he has the grace of charity which springs from and rests upon his faith in God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Do they not err that devise evil? or, Will they not go astray? The question is an emphatic mode of asserting the truth. They who meditate and practise evil (Proverbs 3:29; Proverbs 6:14) go astray from the right way - the way of life; their views are distorted, and they no longer see their proper course. Thus the remorseful voluptuary bemoans himself, \"We have erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction; yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it\" (Wisd. 5:6, etc.), Mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. God's blessing will rest upon them. The combination of \"mercy and truth\" is found in Psalm 61:7; in Wisd. 3:9 and 4:15, and in 1 Timothy 1:2 we have \"grace and mercy\" (see note on Proverbs 3:3, where the two words occur in connection; and comp. Proverbs 16:6; Proverbs 20:28). The two graces in the text signify the love and mercy which God bestows on the righteous, and the truth and fidelity with which he keeps the promises which he has made. The Vulgate makes the two graces human, not Divine: \"Mercy and truth procure blessings.\" The Septuagint renders, \"The good devise mercy and truth.\" It adds a paraphrase not found in the Hebrew, \"The devisers of evil know not mercy and faith; but alms and faith are with the devisers of good.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - In all labour there is profit. All honest industry has a reward, and all care and pain borne for a good object bring comfort and content (comp. Proverbs 10:22). So the Greek distich says -NEWLINENEWLINEἍπαντα τὰ καλὰ τοῦ πονοῦντος γίγνεταιNEWLINENEWLINE\"To him who labours all fair things belong.\" In contrast to the diligent are those who talk much and do nothing. But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury (Proverbs 21:5). Those who work much get profit; those who talk much and do little come to want. So in spiritual matters Christ teaches that they who think that prayer is heard for much speaking are mistaken; and he adds, \"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 6:7; Matthew 7:21). Septuagint, \"In every one who taketh thought (μεριμνῶντι) there is abundance; he who liveth pleasantly and without pain shall be in want.\" Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:10 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis:NEWLINESermo datus cunctis, animi sapientia paucis.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Against the wordy strive not thou in words;NEWLINEConverse with all, but to the favoured fewNEWLINEImpart thy heart's deep wisdom.\" Oriental proverbs: \"Sweet words, empty bands;\" \"To speak of honey will not make the mouth sweet;\" \"We do not cook rice by babbling\" (Lane). Turkish, \"The language of actions is more eloquent than the language of words.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The crown of the wise is their riches. This is taken by some ('Speaker's Commentary') to mean the glory of the wise man, the fame and splendour which surround him, constitute his wealth; but it is better to interpret it thus: Riches are an ornament to a wise man; they enhance and set off his wisdom in the eyes of others, enable him to use it to advantage, and are not the snare which they might be because they are employed religiously and profitably for the good of others. Ecclesiastes 7:11, \"Wisdom is good together with an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun.\" The Septuagint has, \"The crown of the wise is the clever man (πανοῦργος),\" for which has been substituted by some editors, in agreement with the present Hebrew text, πλοῦτους αὐτῶν, \" their wealth.\" The Greek translators, according to their reading, denote that one eminently clever man is a glory to the whole body of wise men. But the folly of fools is only folly; that is, even though it were accompanied with riches. Decorate folly as you may, trick it out in gaud and ornament, it is still nothing but folly, and is discerned as such, and that all the more for being made conspicuous. Schultens, followed by Wordsworth, finds a play of words here. The words rendered \"fool\" and \"folly\" imply \"fatness,\" like the Greek παχὺς and the Latin crassus, which have also this double meaning. So the sentence reads, \"Riches are a crown to the wise; but the abundant fatness of fools is only fatness.\" The last clause is translated by the LXX., \"But the fools' way of life (διατριβὴ) is evil.\" St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 22:8) comments on this verse thus: \"It was these riches of wisdom that Solomon having before his eyes, saith, 'The crown of the wise is their riches.' Which same person, because it is not metals of earth, but understanding, that he calls by the name of riches, thereupon adds by way of a contrary, 'But the foolishness of fools is imprudence.' For if he called earthly riches the crown of the wise. surely he would own the senselessness of fools to be poverty rather than imprudence. But whereas he added, 'the foolishness of fools is imprudence,' he made it plain that he called prudence 'the riches of the wise'\" (Oxford tran cf.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - A true witness delivereth souls (ver. 5; Proverbs 12:17). A true witness saves persons who are in danger owing to false accusation or calumny; saves lives; \"saves from evils,\" says the Septuagint. But a deceitful witness speaketh lies, and therewith endangers lives. Literally, He who breatheth out lies is deceit; he is a personification of fraud, dominated and informed by it; it has become his very nature. \"Falsehood is the devil's daughter, and speaks her father's tongue.\" Septuagint, \"But a deceitful witness kindles (ἐκκαίει) lies.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence. The fear of God casts out all fear of man, all despairing anticipations of possible evil, and makes the believer confident and bold. St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:33), \"As in the way of the world fear gives rise to weakness, so in the way of God fear produces strength. In truth, our mind so much the more valorously sets at naught all the terrors of temporal vicissitudes, the more thoroughly that it submits itself in fear to the Author of those same temporal things. And being stablished in the fear of the Lord, it encounters nothing without it to fill it with alarm, in that whereas it is united to the Creator of all things by a righteous fear, it is by a certain powerful influence raised high above them all.\" Comp. Psalm 27:1 and St. Paul's words, \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\" (Romans 8:31). Septuagint, \"In the fear of the Lord is hope of strength.\" And his children shall have a place of refuge (Psalm 46:1). There is an ambiguity as to whose children are meant. The LXX. renders, \"And to his children he will leave a support.\" Thus many refer the pronoun to the Lord named in the first clause - God's children, those who love and trust him, and look up to him as a Father, an expression used more specially in the New Testament than in the Old. But see Psalm 73:15, and passages (e.g. Hosea 11:1) where God calls Israel his son, a type of all who are brought unto him by adoption and grace. Others, again, refer the pronoun to \"the fear of the Lord,\" \"its children,\" which would be quite in conformity with Hebrew idiom; as we have \"sons of wisdom,\" \"children of obedience,\" equivalent to \"wise,\" \"obedient,\" etc. But most modern commentators explain it of the children of the God-fearing man, comparing Exodus 20:6 and Psalm 103:17. Such a one shall confer lasting benefits upon his posterity (ch. 13:22; 20:7). So God blessed the descendants of Abraham and David; so he shows mercy unto thousands i.e. the thousandth generation of them that love him and keep his commandments (see Genesis 17:7, etc.; Exodus 34:7; 1 Kings 11:12, etc.; Jeremiah 33:20, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - A repetition of Proverbs 13:14, substituting the fear of the Lord for \"the law of the wise.\" The fear of the Lord can he called a fountain of life, because, showing itself in obedience, it nourishes the flowers and fruits of faith, produces graces and virtues, and prepares the soul for immortality. Septuagint, \"The commandment of the Lord is a fountain of life, and makes one decline from the snare of death.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - In the multitude of people is the king's honour (glory); but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince; or, of the principality. This maxim is not in accordance with the views of Oriental conquerors and despots, who in their selfish lust of aggrandizement cared not what suffering they inflicted or what blood they shed; who made a wilderness and called it peace. The reign of Solomon, the peaceful, gave an intimation that war and conquest were not a monarch's highest glory: that a happy and numerous people, dwelling securely and increasing in numbers, was a better honour for a king and more to be desired (1 Kings 4:20). Increase of population is not, as some political economists would teach, in itself an evil; it is rather a sign of prosperity, and is in agreement with the primeval blessing, \"Increase and multiply;\" and though it may be hard to maintain the exact equilibrium between production and consumers, yet wise legislation can foresee and remedy the difficulty, the abundance in one part can supply the scarcity in another, the providence of God watching over all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding. The Hebrew expression for what the Septuagint calls μακροθυμος, \"long suffering,\" and the Vulgate, patiens, is \"long in nostrils\" (Proverbs 15:18), as the contrary temper, which we had in ver. 17, is \"short in nostrils.\" That organ, into which was breathed the breath of life (Genesis 2:7), is taken as the seat of the inward spirit, and as showing by exterior signs the dominant feeling. The original is very terse, \"long in nostrils, great in understanding.\" A man's prudence and wisdom are displayed by his being slow to take offence and being patient under injury. He that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly; i.e. flaunts it in the eyes of all men, makes plain exposure of it. Septuagint, \"He who is short in temper is a mighty fool.\" \"Passion,\" says an old saw, \"makes fools of the wise. and shows the folly of the foolish\" (comp. Proverbs 12:23; Proverbs 13:16). The word rendered \"exalteth,\" צּצּצּ (marim), occurs in Proverbs 3:35, and is taken by Delitzsch and Nowack in the sense of \"carries away\" as the assured result. \"By anger,\" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:78), \"wisdom is parted with, so that we are left wholly in ignorance what to do, and in what order to do it.... Anger withdraws the light of understanding, while by agitating it troubles the mind.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - A sound heart is the life of the flesh. The heart that is healthy, morally and physically, spreads its beneficent influence over the whole body in all its functions and relations; this is expressed by the word for \"flesh\" (besarim), being in the plural number, as the Vulgate renders, vita carnium, but the contrast is better developed by taking מרפא in its other signification of \"calm,\" \"gentle,\" \"meek,\" as Ecclesiastes 10:4. Thus the Septuagint, \"The man of gentle mind (πραυ'´θυμος) is the physician of the heart.\" The tranquil, well controlled heart gives health and vigor to the whole frame (see on Proverbs 15:4). But envy is the rottenness of the bones (Proverbs 12:4). Envy, like a canker, eats away a man's life and strength; it tells on his physical as well as his moral condition. We hays parallel expressions in classical authors. Thus Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:257 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis.\" Martial, 'Epigr.,' 5:28 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Rubiginosis cuncta dentibus rodit;NEWLINEHominem malignum forsan esse tu credas,NEWLINEEgo esse miserum credo, cui placet nemo.\" Bengal proverb, \"In seeing another's wealth it is not good to have the eyes smart.\" Arabic. \"Envy is a raging fever, and has no rest\" (Lane). \"O invidia,\" cries St. Jerome ('Epist.,' 45), \"primum mordax tui.\" \"When the foul sore of envy corrupts the vanquished heart,\" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:85). \"the very exterior itself shows how forcibly the mind is urged by madness. For paleness seizes the complexion, the eyes are weighed down, the spirit is inflamed, while the limbs are chilled, there is frenzy in the heart, there is gnashing with the teeth, and while the growing bate is buried in the depths of the heart, the pent wound works into the conscience with a blind grief\" Septuagint, \"A sensitive heart (καρδία αἰσθητική) is a worm (σής) in the bones.\" A heart that feels too acutely and is easily affected by external circumstances, prepares for itself constant vexation and grief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker, even God. who hath placed men in their several conditions (Proverbs 17:5; Proverbs 22:2). \"The poor shall never cease out of the land\" (Deuteronomy 15:11); \"The poor ye have always with you,\" said Christ (Matthew 26:11); therefore to harass and oppress the poor because he is in this lowly condition, is virtually to arraign the providence of God, who is the Father of all, and has made all men brothers, however differing in worldly position. Christ puts the duty of aiding the poor on the high ground of his solidarity with his people (Matthew 25:40, 45), how that in ministering unto the least of these his brethren men are ministering unto him. \"Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord\" (Ecclus. 11:14). Even the heathen could say -NEWLINENEWLINEἈεὶ νομίζονθ οἱ πένητες τῶν Θεῶν.NEWLINENEWLINEDeem ever that the poor are God's own gift.\" Septuagint, \"He that calumniates (συκοφανῶν; calumniatur, Vulgate) the poor angers him who made him.\" This version refers to oppression of the poor by means of calumny or false and frivolous accusation. But he that honoureth him - the Lord - hath mercy on the poor; or, better, he that hath mercy upon the poor honoureth him; for he shows that he has proper regard to God's ordinance, acts on high motives, and is not led astray by worldly considerations. Christ himself has consecrated poverty by coming in low estate (2 Corinthians 8:9), and they who love and honour him are glad to minister to his brethren in their poverty and distress (comp. James 1:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The wicked is driven away in his wickedness. So the Greek and Latin Versions. In his very act of sin, flagrante delicto, the wicked is defeated, driven from hope and life; as the Revised Version renders, \"The wicked is thrust down in his evil doing;\" i.e. there is some element of weakness in an evil deed which occasions its discovery and punishment, sooner or later. Thus \"murder will out,\" we say. But the contrast is better emphasized by taking ra in its other sense of \"calamity,\" \"misfortune,\" thus: \"In his calamity the wicked is cast down\" (Proverbs 24:16). When misfortune comes upon him, he has no defence, no hope; he collapses utterly; all his friends forsake him; there is none to comfort or uphold him (comp. Matthew 7:26, 27). But the righteous hath hope in his death (comp. Ecclus. 1:13). Primarily, the clause means that even in the greatest danger the good man loses not his trust in God. It is like Job's word (if our reading is correct, Job 13:15), \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;\" and the psalmist, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me\" (Psalm 23:4). Thus the Christian martyrs went joyfully to the stake, and gentle women and little children smiled on the sword which sent them home. It is natural to see in this clause a belief in a future life, and a state of rewards and punishments; and some commentators, holding that this doctrine was net known in pre-exilian days, have taken occasion from its plain enunciation in this paragraph to affix a very late date to our book. There are two answers to be made to this assertion. First, it is capable of proof that the belief in the immortality of the soul, with its consequences in another state, was held, however vaguely, by the Jews long before Solomon's time (see note, Proverbs 12:28); secondly, the present passage is by some read differently, whence is obtained another rendering, which removes from it all trace of the doctrine in question. Thus Ewald and others would read the clause in this way: \"The righteous hath hope, or taketh refuge, from his own deeds.\" There can be no reasonable doubt that the usual reading and translation are correct; but the above considerations show that no argument as to the date of the Proverbs can be safely founded on this verse. The LXX. has a different reading for במותו, \"in his death,\" and translates, \"But he who trusteth in his own holiness is just\" - which looks like a travesty of Scripture, but probably refers to the consciousness of having a heart right with God and obedient to the requirements of the Divine Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding. The wise man is not always blurting out and making a display of his wisdom; he lets it lie still and hidden till there is occasion to use it with effect (Proverbs 10:14; Proverbs 12:23). But that which is in the midst of fools is made known; literally and better, but in the midst of fools it, wisdom, maketh itself known. That is, in contrast to the folly of fools, wisdom is seen to great advantage; or, it may be, the conceited display of the fool's so called wisdom is contrasted with the modesty and reticence of the really intelligent man. \"A fool's heart is ever dancing on his lips,\" says a proverb. So Ecclus. 21:26, \"The heart of fools is in their mouth; but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.\" Theognia, 1163 -NEWLINENEWLINEὈφθαλμοὶ καὶ γκῶσσα καὶ οὔατα καὶ νόος ἀνδρῶνNEWLINEἘν μέσσῳ στηθέων ἐν αυνετοις φύεται.NEWLINENEWLINE\"The eyes, and tongue, and ears, and mind alikeNEWLINEAre centred in the bosom of the wise.\" Vulgate, \"In the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom, and it will teach all the unlearned.\" Wisdom sits enshrined in the intelligent man's mind, and thence disseminates instruction and light around to all who need it. The Septuagint, with which agree the Syriac, Aquila, and Theodotion, inserts a negative in the second clause, thus: \"In the good heart of a man shall rest wisdom, but in the heart of fools it is not discerned\" (Wisd. 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRighteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Righteousness exalteth a nation. \"Righteousness\" (Proverbs 10:2) is the rendering to all their due, whether to God or man. We are taught the salutary lesson that a nation's real greatness consists not in its conquests, magnificence, military or artistic skill, but in its observance of the requirements of justice and religion. Hesiod, Αργ. 223 -NEWLINENEWLINEΟἱ δὲ δίκας ξείνοισι καὶ ἐνδήμοισι διδοῦσινNEWLINEἸθείας καὶ μή τι παρεκβαίνουσι δικαίουNEWLINEΤοῖσι τέθηλε πόλις λαοὶ δ ἀνθεῦσιν ἐν αὐτῇ But sin is a reproach to any people; to peoples. The words for \"nation\" (goi) and \"peoples\" (leummim) are usually applied to foreign nations rather than to the Hebrews; and Wordsworth sees here a statement a fortiori: if righteousness exalts and sin degrades heathen nations, how much more must this be the case with God's own people, who have clearer revelations and heavier responsibilities! חֶסֶד (chesed) occurs in the sense of \"reproach,\" in Leviticus 20:17, and with a different punctuation in Proverbs 25:10 of this book. Its more usual meaning is \"mercy\" or \"piety;\" hence some have explained the clause: \"The piety of the peoples, i.e. the worship of the heathen, is sin; and others, taking \"sin\" as put metonymically for \"sin offering,\" render: \"Piety is an atonement for the peoples.\" But there is no doubt that the Authorized Version is correct (comp. Proverbs 11:11). Thus Symmachus renders it by ὄνειδος, \"shame;\" and in the same sense the Chaldee Paraphrase. The Vulgate and Septuagint, owing to the common confusion of the letters daleth and resh, have read cheser instead of chesed, and render thus: Vulgate, \"Sin makes peoples miserable;\" Septuagint, \"Sins diminish tribes.\" The sin of nations contrasted with the righteousness in the first clause must be injustice, impiety, and violence. See a grand passage in the fifth book of St. Augustine's 'De Civitate Dei,' ch. 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs14:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The king's favour is toward a wise servant; servant that dealeth wisely (Revised Version). Thus Joseph was advanced to the highest post in Egypt, owing to the wisdom which he displayed; so, too, in the case of Daniel (comp. Matthew 24:45, 47). But his wrath is against him that causeth shame; literally, he that doeth shamefully shall be (the object of) his wrath. The Vulgate translates, Iracundiam ejus inutilis sustinebit; the Septuagint makes the second clause parallel to the first, \"An intelligent servant is acceptable to the king, and by his expertness (εὐτοροφίᾳ) he removeth disgrace.\" Then is added, before the first verse of the next chapter, a paragraph which looks like an explanation of the present clause, or an introduction to ver. 1 of ch. 15.: \"Anger destroyeth even the prudent.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - A soft answer turneth away wrath.

This means either, brings it forth opportunely, it the right time and place, or illustrates it, makes it beautiful and pleasant, as ver. 13. The wise man not only has knowledge, but can give it appropriate expression (comp. Proverbs 16:23). Vulgate, \"The tongue of the wise adorneth wisdom.\" The wise man, by producing his sentiments and opinions in appropriate language and on proper occasions, commends wisdom, and renders it acceptable to his hearers. Septuagint, \"The tongue of the wise knoweth what is fair (καλά).\" But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness (ver. 28). A fool cannot open his mouth without exposing his folly; he speaks without due consideration or discretion; as the Vulgate terms it, ebullit, \"he bubbles over,\" like a boiling pot, which emits its contents inopportunely and uselessly. Septuagint, \"The mouth of fools proclaimeth evil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding - keeping watch on - the evil and the good. The omnipresence and omniscience of Jehovah, the covenant God, is strongly insisted upon, and the sacred name recurs continually in this and the next chapter, and indeed throughout this Book of the Proverbs (see Wordsworth, in loc.). The LXX. renders the verb σκοπεύοιυσι \"are watching,\" as from a tower or high place. To the usual references we may add Ecclus. 15:18, 19 Ecclus. 23:19, 20. Corn. a Lapide quotes Prudentius's hymn, used in the Latin Church at Thursday Lauds -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Speculator adstat desuper,NEWLINEQui nos diebus omnibusNEWLINEActusque nostros prospicitNEWLINEA luce prima in vesperum.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"For God our Maker, ever nigh,NEWLINESurveys us with a watchful eye;NEWLINEOur every thought and act he knows,NEWLINEFrom early dawn to daylight's close.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A wholesome tongue is a tree of life; a tongue that brings healing, that soothes by its words. Septuagint, \"the healing of the tongue.\" But the Vulgate rendering is better, lingua placabilis, \"the gentle, mild tongue\" (see on Proverbs 14:30). Speech from such a source refreshes and vivifies all who come under its influence, like the wholesome fruit of a prolific tree (comp. Proverbs 3:18; Proverbs 11:30).NEWLINENEWLINEΨυχῆς νοσούσης ἐστὶ φάρμακον λόγοςNEWLINENEWLINE\"The sick soul by a healing word is cured.\" But perverseness therein - in the tongue - is a breach in the spirit. The perverseness intended must be falsehood, perversion of the truth. This is ruin and vexation (Isaiah 65:14, where the same word is used) in the spirit, both in the liar himself, whose higher nature is thus terribly marred and spoiled, and in the case of his neighbour, who is injured by his slander and falsehood to the, very core. The LXX., with a different reading, translates, \"But he who keepeth it [the tongue] shall be filled with the spirit.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A fool despiseth his father's instruction (Proverbs 10:1): but he that regardeth reproof is prudent (Proverbs 19:25). The son who attends to his father's reproof dealeth prudently, or becomes wiser. Astutior fiet, Vulgate; πανουργότερος, Septuagint. The Vulgate has here a distich which is not in the Hebrew, but a similar paragraph is found in the Septuagint. Thus Vulgate, \"In the abundance of righteousness virtue is greatest; but the imaginations of the wicked shall be rooted up;\" Septuagint, \"In the abundance of righteousness is much strength; but the impious shall be destroyed from the very root.\" The addition seems to have been an explanation of the following verse, which has been foisted into the text here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In the house of the righteous is much treasure (chosen; see on Proverbs 27:24). The good man's store is not wasted or wrongly used, and is blest by God: and therefore, whether absolutely much or little, it is safe, and it is sufficient. In a spiritual sense, the soul of the righteous is filled with graces and adorned with good works. Septuagint, \"In the houses of the righteous is much strength;\" plurima fortitudo, Vulgate. But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. Great revenues acquired by wrong or expended badly bring only trouble, vexation, and ruin upon a man and his family. Septuagint, \"The fruits of the wicked shall perish.\" Spiritually, the works of the wicked cause misery to themselves and others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The lips of the wise disperse knowledge (ver. 2; Proverbs 10:31). The LXX. takes the verb יִרָוּ in its other signification of \"binding\" or \"embracing,\" and translates, \"The lips of the wise are bound (δέδεται) with knowledge;\" i.e. knowledge is always on them and controls their movements. The wise know when to speak, when to be silent, and what to say. But the heart of the foolish doeth not so; i.e. doth not disperse knowledge. Vulgate, cor stultorum dissimile erit, \"will be unlike,\" which probably means the same as the Authorized Version. (Compare a similar use of the words lo-ken in Genesis 48:18; Exodus 10:11.) But the contrast is stated rather weakly by this rendering, lips and heart having the same office to perform; hence it is better, with Delitzsch, Ewald, and others, to take כֵן (ken) as an adjective in the sense of \"right\" or \"trustworthy,\" and either to supply the former verb, \"disperseth that which is not right,\" or to render, \"The heart of the foot is not directed right;\" the fool goes astray, and leads himself and others into error. Septuagint, \"The hearts of fools are not safe (ἀσφαλεῖς).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord. The costly sacrifice of the wicked is contrasted with the prayer, unaccompanied with sacrifice, of the upright. The first clause occurs again in Proverbs 21:27, and virtually in Proverbs 28:9. But in the latter passage the prayer of the wicked is denounced as abomination. Sacrifice, as legal and ceremonial, would be more naturally open to the charge of deadness and unreality; while prayer, as spontaneous and not legally enjoined, might be deemed less liable to for realism; all the more hateful, therefore, it is if not offered from the heart. The worthlessness of external worship without obedience and devotion of the heart is often urged by the prophets (see 1 Samuel 15:22; Isaiah 1:11, etc.; Jeremiah 6:20; Hosea 5:6; Amos 5:22; see also Ecclus. 31:18, etc.). The lesson was needed that the value of sacrifice depended upon the mind and disposition of the offerer, the tendency being to rest in the opus operatum, as if the external action was all that was necessary to make the worshipper accepted. This text was wrested by the Donatists to support their notion of the inefficacy of heretical baptism. St. Augustine replied that the validity of the sacrament depended not on the spiritual condition of the minister, but on the appointment of Christ. The text has also been applied to confirm the opinion that all the acts of unjustified man are sin. The truer view is that God's grace does act beyond the limits of his visible Church, and that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit concurs with the free will of man before he is formally justified. The second clause recurs virtually in ver. 29.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This verse gives the reason for the treatment specified in the preceding verse (comp. Proverbs 11:20; Proverbs 12:22). Followeth after; chaseth, implying effort and perseverance, as in the pursuit of game (Proverbs 11:19; Proverbs 21:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCorrection is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way. The verse is climacteric, and the first clause is better translated, There is a grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; then the second clause denotes what that correction is: he that hateth reproof - i.e. he that forsaketh the way - shall die. \"The way\" is the path of goodness and righteousness (Proverbs 2:13). \"The way of life.\" the Vulgate calls it; so Proverbs 10:17. Ecclesiastes 21:6, \"He that hateth reproof is in the way of sinners.\" The Authorized Version is quite allowable, and is supported in some degree by the Vulgate, Doctrina mala deserenti viam vitae. The sinner is annoyed by discipline, correction, or true teaching, because they curb the indulgence of his passions, make him uneasy in conscience, and force him to look to future issues. Septuagint, \"The instruction of the guileless (ἀκάκου) is known by passers-by; but they who hate reproofs die shamefully.\" The Syriac adopts the same rendering; but it is a question whether the word ought not to be κακοῦ. Menander says -NEWLINENEWLINEὉ μὴ δαρεὶς ἄνθρωπος οὐ παιδεύεται.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Man unchastised learns naught.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Hell and destruction are before the Lord. The two words rendered \"hell\" and \"destruction\" are respectively Sheol and Abaddon, Infernus and Perditio, Ἅιδης and ἀπώλεια (comp. Proverbs 27:20). The former is used generally as the place to which the souls of the dead are consigned - the receptacle of all departed spirits, whether good or bad. Abaddon is the lowest depth of hell, the \"abyss\" of Luke 8:31; Revelation 9:2, etc.; 20:l, etc. The clause means that God's eye penetrates even the most secret corners of the unseen world. As Job (Job 26:6) says, \"Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering\" (comp. Psalm 139:7, etc.). How much more then the hearts of the children of men? (For the form of the expression, comp. Proverbs 11:31 and Proverbs 19:7; and for the import, Proverbs 16:2; Proverbs 21:2; Jeremiah 17:10.) If God knows the secrets of the world beyond the grave, much more does he know the secret thoughts of men on earth. The heart is the source of action (see Matthew 15:19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him (Proverbs 9:8; Amos 5:10). For \"scorner\" the Vulgate has pestilens, and the Septuagint ἀπαίδευτος, \"undisciplined.\" \"Scorners\" are spoken of elsewhere, as Proverbs 1:22 (where see note); they are conceited, arrogant persons, free-thinkers, indifferent to or sceptical of religion, and too self-opinionated to be open to advice or reproof. Neither will he go unto the wise, who would correct and teach him (Proverbs 13:20). Septuagint, \"He will not converse (ὁμιλήσει) with the wise.\" He does not believe the maxim -NEWLINENEWLINEΣοφοῦ παρ ἀνδρὸς χρὴ σοφόν τι μανθάνειν.NEWLINENEWLINE\"From a wise man you must some wisdom learn.\" A Latin adage runs -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Argue consultum, te diliget: argue stultumNEWLINEAvertet vultum, nec te dimittet iuultum.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance. The face is the index of the condition of the mind.NEWLINENEWLINE\"In the forehead and the eyeNEWLINEThe lecture of the mind doth lie.\" And, again, \"A blithe heart makes a blooming visage\" (comp. Ecelus. 13:25, etc.). Septuagint, \"When the heart is glad, the face bloometh (θάλλει).\" But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken (Proverbs 12:25). Happiness is shown in the outward look, but sorrow has a deeper and more abiding influence; it touches the inner life, destroys the natural elasticity, creates despondency and despair (comp. Proverbs 16:24; Proverbs 17:22). Corn. a Lapide quotes St. Gregory Nazianzen's definition -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Laetitia quidnam? Mentis est diffusio.NEWLINETristitia? Cordis morsus et turbatio.\" Hitzig and others translate the second clause, \"But in sorrow of heart is the breath oppressed.\" It is doubtful if the words can be so rendered, and certainly the parallelism is not improved thereby.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge (Proverbs 18:15). The wise man knows that he knows nothing, and is always seeking to learn more.NEWLINENEWLINEΣοφία γάρ ἐστι καὶ μαθεῖν ο} μὴ νοεῖςNEWLINENEWLINE\"To learn what thou hast never thought is wisdom.\" The mouth of fools. Another reading, is \"the face of fools;\" but the former is more suitable to what follows. Feedeth on foolishness. So the Vulgate and Septuagint, \"The mouth of the undisciplined knoweth evil.\" The fool is always gaping and devouring every silly, or slanderous, or wicked word that comes in his way, and in his turn utters and disseminates it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - All the days of the afflicted are evil. \"The days of the poor are evil,\" says the Talmud ('Dukes,' 73); but in our verse the contrasted clause restricts the sense of \"the afflicted\" to mental, not material, evil. The Vulgate pauperis gives a wrong impression. The persons intended are such as take a gloomy view of things, who are always in low spirits, and cannot rise superior to present circumstances. These never have a happy moment; they are always taking anxious thought (Matthew 6:25), and forecasting evil. The LXX., reading עיני for עני, translates, \"At all times the eyes of the evil expect evil.\" But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. The cheerful man's condition is a banquet unceasingly, a fixed state of joy and contentment. Septuagint, \"But the righteous are at peace always;\" Vulgate, \"A secure mind is like a perpetual feast.\" \"For,\" says St. Gregory ('Moral,' 12:44), \"the mere repose of security is like the continuance of refreshment. Whereas, on the other hand, the evil mind is always set in pains and labours, since it is either contriving mischiefs that it may bring down, or fearing lest these be brought down upon it by others.\" Our own proverb says, \"A contented mind is a continual feast.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Better is little with the fear of the Lord. The good man's little store, which bears upon it the blessing of the Lord, is better than great treasure and trouble therewith, i.e. with the treasure (Proverbs 16:8; Psalm 37:16). The trouble intended is the care and labour and anxiety attending the pursuit and preservation of wealth. \"Much coin, much care\" (comp. Ecclesiastes 6:4). It was good advice of the old moralist, \"Sis pauper honeste potius quam dives male; Namque hoc fert crimen, illud misericordiam.\" Vulgate, thesauri magni et insatiabiles, \"treasures which satisfy not;\" Septuagint, \"Great treasures without fear (of the Lord).\" Christ's maxim is, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matthew 6:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Better is a dinner (portion) of herbs where love is. A dish of vegetables would be the common meal, whereas flesh would be reserved for festive occasions. Where love presides, the simplest food is cheerfully received, and contentment and happiness abound (Proverbs 17:1). Lesetre quotes Horace's invitation to his friend Torquatus ('Epist.,' 1:5. 1) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Si potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis,NEWLINENec modica cenare times olus omne patella,NEWLINESupreme te sole domi, Torquate, manebo.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"If, dear Torquatus, you can rest your headNEWLINEOn couches such as homely Archias made,NEWLINENor on a dish of simple pot herbs frown,NEWLINEI shall expect you as the sun goes down.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Howes.) So the old jingle -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Cum dat oluscula menes minuscula pace quieta,NEWLINENe pete grandia lautaque prandia lite repleta.\" A stalled ox is one taken up out of the pasture and fatted for the table. Thus we read (1 Kings 4:23) that part of Solomon's provision for one day was ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures; and the prophets speak of \"calves of the stall\" (Amos 6:4; Malachi 4:2; comp. Luke 15:23). The fat beef implies a sumptuous and magnificent entertainment; but such a feast is little worth if accompanied with feelings of hatred, jealousy, and ill will. This and the preceding verse emphasize and explain ver. 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A wrathful man stirreth up strife (contention). This clause recurs almost identically in Proverbs 29:22 (comp. also Proverbs 26:21 and Proverbs 28:25). He that is slow to anger appeaseth strife (Proverbs 14:29). In the former clause the word for \"contention\" is madon, in the latter \"strife\" is rib, which often means \"law dispute.\" It requires two to make a quarrel, and where one keeps his temper and will not be provoked, anger must subside. Vulgate, \"He who is patient soothes aroused quarrels (suscitatas).\" Septuagint, \"A long suffering man appeases even a coming battle.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Regina rerum omnium patientia.\" The LXX. here introduces a second rendering of the verse: \"A long suffering man will quench suits; but the impious rather awaketh them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns. The indolent sluggard is always finding or imagining difficulties and hindrances in his path, which serve as excuses for his laziness. The word for \"thorn\" here is chedek. It occurs elsewhere only in Micah 7:4, where the Authorized Version has \"briar;\" but the particular plant intended is not ascertained. Most writers consider it to be some spinous specimen of the solanum. The word refers, it is thought, to a class of plants the name of one of which, at least, the miscalled \"apple of Sodom,\" is well known in poetry, and is a proverbial expression for anything which promises fair but utterly disappoints on trial. \"This plant, which is really a kind of potato, grows everywhere in the warmer parts of Palestine, rising to a widely branching shrub from three to five feet high; the wood thickly set with spines; the flower like that of the potato, and the fruit, which is larger than the potato apple, perfectly round, and changing from yellow to bright red as it ripens.... The osher of the Arab is the true apple of Sodom. A very tropical-looking plant, its fruit is like a large smooth apple or orange, and hangs in clusters of three or four together. When ripe, it is yellow, and looks fair and attractive, and is soft to the touch, but if pressed, it bursts with a crack, and only the broken shell and a raw of small seeds in a half-open pod, with a few dry filaments, remain in the hand\" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:74, 117). Cato, 'Dist.,' 54:3, 5 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Segnitiem fugito, quae vitae ignavia fertur;NEWLINENam quum animus languet, consumit inertia corpus.\" To the sluggard is opposed the righteous in the second member, because indolence is a grievous sin, and the greatest contrast to the active industry of the man who fears God and does his duty. The way of the righteous is made plain; \"is a raised causeway;\" selulah, as Proverbs 16:17: Isaiah 40:3; Isaiah 49:11. The upright man, who treads the path appointed for him resolutely and trustfully, finds all difficulties vanish; before him the thorns yield a passage; and that which the sluggard regarded as dangerous and impassable becomes to him as the king's highway. Vulgate, \"The path of the just is without impediment;\" Septuagint, \"The roads of the manly (ἀνδρείων) are well beaten.\" St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:51), \"Whatever adversity may have fallen in their way of life, the righteous stumble not against it. Because with the bound of eternal hope, and of eternal contemplation, they leap over the obstacles of temporal adversity\" (comp. Psalm 18:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20-ch. 19:25. - Third section of this collection. Verse 20. - (For this verse, see Proverbs 10:1.) A foolish man despiseth his mother, and therefore is \"heaviness\" to her. Or the verb may mean \"shameth.\" \"A foolish man\" is literally \"a fool of a man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFolly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom; literally, void of heart; i.e. of understanding (Proverbs 10:23). The perverse, self-willed fool finds pleasure in going on his evil way, and exposing the fatuity which he takes for wisdom. Septuagint, \"The ways of the senseless are wanting in intelligence.\" A man of understanding walketh uprightly; goes the right way. It is implied that the fool goes the wrong way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithout counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellers they are established.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Without counsel - where no counsel is - purposes are disappointed (Proverbs 11:14); there can be no concerted action, or the means used are not the best that could be devised. Hesiod, Theog., 293 -NEWLINENEWLINEἘσθλὸς δ αϋ κἀκεῖνος ο{ς εϋ εἰπὸ´ντι πίθηταιNEWLINE {Ος δὲ κε μήτ αὐτὸς νοέῃ μήτ ἄλλου ἀκούωνNEWLINEἘν θυμῷ βάλληται ὁ δ αϋτ ἀχρήιος ἀνήρ (Comp. Proverbs 20:18.) In the multitude of counsellors they are established (Proverbs 24:6). We read of \"counsellors\" as almost regular officials in the Hebrew court, as in modern kingdoms (see 1 Chronicles 27:32; Isaiah 1:26; Micah 4:9; comp. Ezra 7:28). There is, of course, the danger of secrets being divulged where counsellors are many; and there is Terence's maxim to fear, \"Quot heroines, tot sententiae;\" but, properly guarded and discreetly used, good counsel is above all price. Septuagint, \"They who honour not councils (συνέδρια) lay aside (ὑπερτίθενται) conclusions (i.e. put off coming to any definite decision); but in the hearts of those who consult counsel abideth\" (compare the parallel clause, Proverbs 19:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23 - A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth. The idea of the preceding verse concerning counsel is maintained. A counsellor gives wise and skilful advice, or makes a timely speech; and, knowing how much harm is done by rash or evil words, he naturally rejoices that he has been able to be useful, and has avoided the errors which the tongue is liable to incur. A word spoken in due season, sermo opportunus, is advice given at the right moment and in the most suitable manner, when the occasion and the interests at stake demand it (comp. Proverbs 25:11). The LXX. connects this verse with the preceding, and renders, \"The evil man will not hearken to it (counsel), nor will he say aught in season or for the public good.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The way of life is above to the wise; Revised Version, to the wise the way of life goeth upward. The writer means primarily that the wise and good lead such a life as to preserve them from death (Proverbs 14:32). The path may be steep and painful, but at any rate it has this compensation - it leads away from destruction. It is obvious to read into the passage higher teaching. The good man's path leads heavenward, to a high life here, to happiness hereafter; his conversation is in heaven (Philippians 3:20), his affections are set on things above (Colossians 3:2). Such an upward life tends to material and spiritual health, as it is added, that he may depart from hell (SheoI) beneath. Primarily, a long and happy life is promised to the man who fears the Lord, as in Proverbs 3:16; secondarily, such a one avoids that downward course which ends in the darkness of hell. Vulgate, \"The path of life is above the instructed man, to make him avoid the nethermost (novissimo) hell;\" Septuagint, \"The thoughts of the prudent man are the ways of life, that turning from Hades he may be safe.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The Lord will destroy the house of the proud (ch. 12:7; 14:11; 16:18). The proud, self-confident man, with his family and household and wealth, shall be rooted up. The heathen saw how retribution overtook the arrogant. Thus Euripides says ('Heracl.,' 387) -NEWLINENEWLINEΤῶν φρονημάτωνNEWLINEὉ Ζεὺς κολαστὴς τῶν ἄγαν ὑπερφρόνωνNEWLINENEWLINE\"Zeus, the chastiser of too haughty thoughts.\" But he will establish the border of the widow. He will take the widow under his protection, and see that her landmark is not removed, and that her little portion is secured to her. The widow is taken as the type of weakness and desolation, as often in Scripture (comp. Deuteronomy 10:18; Psalm 146:9). In a country where property was defined by landmarks - stones or some such objects - nothing was easier than to remove these altogether, or to alter their position. That this was a common form of fraud and oppression we gather from the stringency of the enactments against the offence (see Deuteronomy 19:14; Deuteronomy 27:17; and comp. Job 24:2; Proverbs 22:28). In the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions which have been preserved, there are many invoking curses, curious and multifarious, against the disturbers of boundaries. Such marks were considered sacred and inviolable by the Greeks and Romans (see Plato, 'De Leg.,' 8:842, 843; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The thoughts of the wicked (or, evil devices) are an abomination to the Lord. Although the Decalogue, by forbidding coveting, showed that God's Law touched the thought of the heart as well as the outward action, the idea here refers to wicked plans or designs, rather than emphatically to the secret movements of the mind. These have been noticed in ver. 11. But the words of the pure are pleasant words; literally, pure are words of pleasantness; i.e. words of soothing, comforting tone are, not an abomination to the Lord, as are the devices of the wicked, but they are pure in a ceremonial sense, as it were, a pure and acceptable offering. Revised Version, pleasant words are pure. Vulgate, \"Speech pure and pleasant is approved by him\" - which is a pharaphrase of the clause. Septuagint, \"The words of the pure are honoured (σεμναί).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house (Proverbs 11:29). The special reference is doubtless to venal judges, who wrested judgment for lucre. Such malefactors were often reproved by the prophets (see Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 10:1, etc.; Micah 3:11; Micah 7:3). But all ill-gotten gain brings sure retribution. The Greeks have many maxims to this effect. Thus -NEWLINENEWLINEΚέρδη πομηρὰ ζημίαν ἀεὶ φέρει And again -NEWLINENEWLINEΤὰ δ αἰσχρὰ κέρδη συμφορὰς ἐργάζεταιNEWLINENEWLINE\"Riches ill won bring ruin in their train.\" An avaricious man troubles his house in another sense. He harasses his family by niggardly economies and his domestics by overwork and underfeeding, deprives his household of all comfort, and loses the blessing of God upon a righteous use of earthly wealth. The word \"troubleth\" (akar, \"to trouble\") reminds one of the story of Achan, who, in his greed, appropriated some of the spoil of the banned city Jericho, and brought destruction upon himself and his family, when, in punishment of the crime, he and all his were stoned in the Valley of Achor (Joshua 7:25). So the covetousness of Gehazi caused the infliction of the penalty of leprosy upon himself and his children (2 Kings 5:27). Professor Plumptre ('Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.) notes that the Chaldee Targum paraphrases this clause, referring especially to lucre gained by unrighteous judgments, thus: \"He who gathers the mammon of unrighteousness destroys his house;\" and he suggests that Christ's use of that phrase (Luke 16:9) may have had some connection with this proverb through the version then popularly used in the Palestinian synagogues. He that hateth gifts shall live (comp. Ecclesiastes 7:7). Primarily this refers to the judge or magistrate who is incorruptible, and gives just judgment, and dispenses his patronage without fear or favour; he shall \"prolong his days\" (Proverbs 28:16), And in all cases a man free from covetousness, who takes no bribes to blind his eyes withal, who makes no unjust gains, shall pass a long and happy life undisturbed by care. We see here a hope of immortality, to which integrity leads. The LXX., with the view of making the two clauses more marked in antithesis, restricts the application thus: \"The receiver of gifts destroyeth himself; but he who hateth the receiving of gifts liveth.\" The Vulgate and Septuagint, after this verse, introduce a distich which recurs in Proverbs 16:6. The Septuagint transposes many of the verses at the end of this chapter and the beginning of the next.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The heart of the righteous studieth to answer. The good man deliberates before he speaks, takes time to consider his answer, lest he should say anything false, or inexpedient, or injurious to his neighbour. A Latin adage runs -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Qui bene vult fari debet bene praemeditari.\" Says Theognis -NEWLINENEWLINEΒουλεύου δὶς καὶ τρίς ὅτοί κ ἐπὶ τὸν νόονNEWLINEἈτηρὸς γὰρ ἀεὶ λάβρος ἀνὴρ τελέθειNEWLINENEWLINE\"Whate'er comes in your mind, deliberate;NEWLINEA hasty man but rushes on his fate.\" Septuagint, \"The heart of the prudent will meditate πίστεις,\" which may mean \"truth,\" \"fidelity,\" or \"proofs.\" The Vulgate has \"obedience,\" implying attention to the inward warnings of conscience and grace, before the mouth speaks. Poureth out (ver. 2). The wicked man never considers; evil is always on his lips and running over from his mouth. Septuagint, \"The mouth of the ungodly answereth evil things.\" The LXX. here inserts ch. 16:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The Lord is far from the wicked. The maxim is similar to that in ver. 8 and John 9:31, \"We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.\" God is said to be \"far\" in the sense of not listening, not regarding with favour (comp. Psalm 10:1). His attention to the righteous is seen in Psalm 145:18, 19. The LXX. introduces here Proverbs 16:8, 9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart (Proverbs 16:15). The beaming glance that shows a pure, happy mind and a friendly disposition, rejoices the heart of him on whom it is turned. There is something infectious in the guileless, joyful look of a happy man or child, which has a cheering effect upon those who observe it. The LXX. makes the sentiment altogether personal: \"The eye that seeth what is good rejoiceth the heart.\" A good report (good tidings) maketh the bones fat; strengthens them and gives them health (comp. Proverbs 3:8; Proverbs 16:24). Sight and hearing are compared in the two clauses, \"bones\" in the latter taking the place of \"heart\" in the former. The happy look and good news alike cause joy of heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The ear that heareth (hearkeneth to) the reproof of life abideth among the wise (Proverbs 6:23). The reproof, or instruction, of life is that which teaches the true way of pleasing God, which is indeed the only life worth living. The ear, by synecdoche, is put for the person. One who attends to and profits by such admonition may be reckoned among the wise, and rejoices to be conversant with them. Wordsworth finds a more recondite sense here: the ear of the wise dwells, lodges, passes the night (Proverbs 19:23) in their heart, whereas the heart of fools is in their mouth (Proverbs 14:33). This verse is omitted in the Septuagint, though it is found in the other Greek versions and the Latin Vulgate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - This verse carries on and puts the climax to the lesson of the preceding. He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul; \"hateth himself,\" Septuagint; commits moral suicide, because he does not follow the path of life. He is like a sick man who thrusts away (ἀπωθεῖται, Septuagint) the wholesome medicine which is his only hope of cure. He that heareth (listeneth to) reproof getteth understanding; literally, possesseth a heart, and therefore does not despise his soul, but \"loves it\" (Proverbs 19:8), as the LXX. renders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom; that which leads to and gives wisdom (see Proverbs 1:3, 7, etc.; Proverbs 9:10). 'Pirke Aboth,' 3:26, \"No wisdom, no fear of God; no fear of God, no wisdom. No knowledge, no discernment; no discernment, no knowledge.\" Before honour is humility (Proverbs 18:12). A man who fears God must be humble, and as the fear of God leads to wisdom, it may be said that humility leads to the honour and glory of being wise and reckoned among the wise (ver. 31). A man with a lowly opinion of himself will hearken to the teaching of the wise, and scrupulously obey the Law of God, and will be blessed in his ways. For \"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble\" (James 4:6; comp. Luke 1:52). The maxim in the second clause has a general application. \"He that shall humble himself shall be exalted\" (Matthew 23:12; comp. Luke 14:11; James 4:6). It is sanctioned by the example of Christ himself, the Spirit itself testifying beforehand his sufferings that were to precede his glory (1 Peter 1:11; see also Philippians 2:5, etc.). Septuagint, \"The fear of the Lord is discipline and wisdom, and the beginning of glory shall answer to it.\" Another reading adds, \"Glory goeth before the humble,\" which is explained to mean that the humble set before their eyes the reward that awaits their humility, and patiently endure, like Christ, \"who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God\" (Hebrews 12:2).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - These are specially religions maxims, and they all contain the name Jehovah. Verse 1. - The Authorized Version makes one sentence of this verse without any contrast or antithesis. This is plainly wrong, there being intended a contrast between the thought of the heart and the well ordered speech. It is better translated, The plans of the heart are man's: but the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. Men make plans, arrange speeches, muster arguments, in the mind; but to put these into proper, persuasive words is a gift of God. \"Our sufficiency is of God\" (2 Corinthians 3:5). In the case of Balaam, God overruled the wishes and intentions of the prophet, and constrained him to give utterance to something very different from his original mental conceptions. But the present sentence attributes the outward expression of what the mind has conceived in every case unto the help of God (comp. vers. 9, 33; Proverbs 15:23). Christ enjoined his disciples to trust to momentary inspiration in their apologies or defences before unbelievers (Matthew 10:19). This verse is omitted in the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes (Proverbs 21:2). He may deceive himself, and be blind to his own faults, or be following an ill-informed and ill-regulated conscience (Proverbs 12:15; Proverbs 14:12), yet this is no excuse in God's eyes. The Lord weigheth the spirits. Not the \"ways,\" the outward life and actions only, but motives, intentions, dispositions (Hebrews 4:12). He too knows our secret faults, unsuspected by others, and perhaps by ourselves (Psalm 19:12). The Septuagint has here, \"All the works of the humble are manifest before God, but the impious shall perish in an evil day.\" The next verse is omitted in the Greek; and the other clauses up to ver. 8 are dislocated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Commit thy works unto the Lord. \"Commit\" (gol) is literally \"roll\" (κύλισον, Theodotion), as in Psalm 22:8 and Psalm 37:5; and the injunction means, \"Transfer thy burden to the Lord, cast upon him all that thou hast to do; do all as in his sight, and as an act of duty to him.\" Thus Tobit says to his son, \"Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper\" (Tobit 4:19). The Vulgate, using a different punctuation (gal), renders, \"Reveal to the Lord thy works?' As a child opens its heart to a tender parent, so do thou show to God thy desires and intentions, trusting to his care and providence. And thy thoughts shall be established. The plans and deliberations out of which the \"works\" sprang shall meet with a happy fulfilment, because they are undertaken according to the will of God, and directed to the end by his guidance (comp. Proverbs 19:21; Psalm 90:17; 1 Corinthians 3:9). This verse is not in the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord hath made all things for himself. So the Vulgate, propter semetipsum; and Origen ('Praef. in Job'), δἰ ἑαυτόν. That is, God hath made everything for his own purpose, to answer the design which he hath intended from all eternity (Revelation 4:11). But this translation is not in accordance with the present reading, לַמַּעַנֵהוּ, which means rather \"for its own end,\" for its own proper use. Everything in God's design has its own end and object and reason for being where it is and such as it is; everything exhibits his goodness and wisdom, and tends to his glory. Septuagint, \"All the works of the Lord are with righteousness.\" Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. This clause has been perverted to support the terrible doctrine of reprobation - that God, whose will must be always efficacious, has willed the damnation of some; whereas we are taught that God's will is that \"all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth,\" and that \"God sent his Son not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved\" (1 Timothy 2:4; John 3:17; comp. Ezekiel 33:11). Man, having freewill, can reject this gracious purpose of God, and render the means of salvation nugatory; but this does not make God the cause of man's destruction, but man himself. In saying that God \"made the wicked,\" the writer does not mean that God made him as such, but made him as he made all other things, giving him powers and capacities which he might have used to good, but which, as a fact, he uses to evil. It will be useful here to quote the wise words of St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 6:33), \"The Just and Merciful One, as he disposes the deeds of mortals, vouchsafes some things in mercy, and permits other things in anger; and the things which he permits he so bears with that he turns them to the account of his purpose. And hence it is brought to pass in a marvellous way that even that which is done without t,e will of God is not contrary to the will of God. For while evil deeds are converted to a good use, the very things that oppose his design render service to his design.\" The day of evil is the hour of punishment (Isaiah 10:3; Job 21:30), which by a moral law will inevitably fall upon the sinner. God makes man's wickedness subserve his purposes and manifest his glory, as we see in the case of Pharaoh (Exodus 9:16), and the crucifixion of our blessed Lord (Acts 2:23; comp. Romans 9:22). It is a phase of God's moral government that an evil day should be appointed for transgressors, and it is from foreknowledge of their deserts that their punishment is prepared. The perplexing question, why God allows men to come into the world whom he knows will meet with perdition, is not handled here. Septuagint, \"But the impious is kept for an evil day.\" Cato, 'Dist.,' 2:8 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nolo putes pravos homines peccata lucrari:NEWLINETemporibus peccata latent, sed tempore patent.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - (For the first member, see Proverbs 6:17; Proverbs 8:13.) Says the maxim -NEWLINENEWLINEἈλαζονείας οὔ τις ἐκφεύγει δίκηνNEWLINENEWLINE\"Pride hath its certain punishment.\" We read in the Talmud, \"Of every proud man God says, He and I cannot live in the world together.\" A mediaeval jingle runs -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Hoc retine verbum, frangit Deus omne superbum.\" Septuagint, \"Impure in the sight of God is every high-hearted man (ὑψηλοκάρδιος).\" The second member is found in Proverbs 11:21, and must be taken as a form of adjuration. Septuagint, \"Putting hands on hand unjustly, he shall not be innocent;\" i.e. one who acts violently and unjustly shall be held guilty - which seems a trite truism. Many commentators interpret the clause as if it meant that the cooperation and combination of sinners in evil practices will not save them from retribution. But hand clasping hand in token of completing a bargain or alliance is scarcely an early Oriental custom. There is an analogous saying in Greek which implies mutual assistance -NEWLINENEWLINEΞεὶρ χεῖρα νίπτει δακτυλός τε δάκτυλονNEWLINENEWLINE\"Hand washes hand, and finger finger.\" The LXX. has here two distiches, the first of which occurs in the Vulgate, but the second is not found there. Neither appears in our present Hebrew text. \"The beginning of the good way is to do what is just; this is more acceptable to God than to sacrifice sacrifices. He who seeketh the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness; and they who seek him rightly alkali find peace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - By mercy and truth iniquity is purged; atoned for. The combination \"mercy and truth\" occurs in Proverbs 3:3 (where see note), and intimates love to God and man, and faithfulness in keeping promises and truth and justice in all dealings. It is by the exercise of those graces, not by mere external rites, that God is propitiated (see on Proverbs 10:2). A kind of expiatory value is assigned to these virtues, which, indeed, must not be pressed too closely, but should be examined by the light of such passages in the New Testament as Luke 11:41; Acts 10:4. Of course, such graces show themselves only in one who is really devout and God fearing; they are the fruits of a heart at peace with God and man, and react on the character and conduct. The LXX., which places this distich after ver. 27 of ch. 15, translates, \"By alms and faithfulness (πίστεσιν) sins are cleansed,\" confining the term \"mercy\" to one special form, as in one reading of Matthew 6. l, \"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness [al. alms] before men.\" By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil. The practice of true religion, of course, involves abstinence from sin; and this seems so unnecessary a truth to be formally stated that some take the \"evil\" named to be physical, not moral evil; calamity, not transgression. But the two clauses are coordinate, and present two aspects of the same truth. The first intimates how sin is to be expiated, the second how it is to be avoided. The morally good man meets with pardon and acceptance, and he who fears God is delivered from evil. So we pray, in the Lord's Prayer, \"Forgive us our trespasses, and deliver us from evil.\" Septuagint, \"By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil\" (comp. Proverbs 14:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - When a man's ways please the Lord, which they can do only when they are religious, just, and charitable. He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him; to submit themselves. Experience proves that nothing succeeds like success. Where a man is prosperous and things go well with him, even ill-wishers are content to east away or to dissemble their dislike, and to live at peace with him. Thus Abimelech King of Gerar fawned upon Isaac because he saw that the Lord was with him (Genesis 26:27, etc.). This is the worldly side of the maxim. It has a higher aspect, and intimates the far reaching influence of goodness - how it disarms opposition, arouses reverence and love, gives no occasion for disputes, and spreads around an atmosphere of peace. To the Jews the maxim was taught by external circumstances. While they were doing the will of the Lord, their land was to be preserved from hostile attack (Exodus 34:24; 2 Chronicles 17:10). And Christians learn that it is only when they obey and fear God that they can overcome the assaults of the enemies of their soul - the devil, the world, and the flesh Talmud, \"He who is agreeable to God is equally agreeable to men.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Better is a little with righteousness (Proverbs 15:16; Psalm 37:16). \"Righteousness\" may mean here a holy life or just dealing; as without right, or, with injustice, in the second clause, may refer either generally wickedness, or specially to fraud and oppression (Jeremiah 22:13). Says Theognis -NEWLINENEWLINEΒούλεο δ εὐσεβέων ὀλίγοις σὺν χρήμασιν οἰκεῖνNEWLINEΗ πλουτεῖν ἀδίκως χρήματα πασάμενος.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Wish thou with scanty means pious to live,NEWLINERather than rich with large, ill-gotten wealth.\" Another maxim says to the same effect -NEWLINENEWLINEΛεπτῶς καλῶς ζῇν κρεῖσσον η} λαμπρῶς κακῶς. Septuagint, \"Better is small getting (λῆψις) with righteousness, than great revenues with iniquity\" (see on Proverbs 15:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps (ver. 1). \"Man proposes, God disposes\" or, as the Germans say, \"Der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt\" (comp. Proverbs 20:24). The word rendered \"deviseth\" implies, by its spectra, intensity of thought and care. Man meditates and prepares his plans with the utmost solicitude, but it rests with God whether he shall carry them to completion or not, and whether, if they are to be accomplished, it be done with ease or with painful labour (comp. Genesis 24:12, etc.). We all remember Shakespeare's words in 'Hamlet' -NEWLINENEWLINE\"There's a divinity that shapes our ends,NEWLINERough-hew them how we will.\" Septuagint, \"Let the heart of man consider what is just, that his steps may be by God directed might\" (comp. Jeremiah 10:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A Divine sentence is in the lips of the king. קֶסֶם (quesem) is \"divination,\" \"soothsaying,\" oracular utterance. Septuagint, μαντεῖον. The king's words have, in people's minds, the certainty and importance of a Divine oracle, putting an end to all controversy or division of opinion. It seems to be a general maxim, not especially referring to Solomon or the theocratic kingdom, but rather indicating the traditional view of the absolute monarchy. The custom of deifying kings and invoking them as gods was usual in Egypt and Eastern countries, and made its way to the West. \"It is the voice of a god, and not of a man,\" cried the people, when Herod addressed them in the amphitheatre at Caesarea (Acts 12:22). The Greeks could say -NEWLINENEWLINEΑἰκὼν δὲ βασιλεύς ἐστιν ἔμψυχος Θεοῦ.NEWLINENEWLINE\"God's very living image is the king.\" And thus his utterances were regarded as irrefragably true and decisive. His month transgresseth not in judgment. The decisions which he gives are infallible, and, at any rate, irresistible. We may refer to Solomon's famous verdict concerning the two mothers (1 Kings 3:16, etc.), and such sentences as Proverbs 8:15, \"By me (wisdom) kings reign, and princes decree justice\" (see below on ver. 12; Proverbs 21:1); and David's words (2 Samuel 23:4), \"He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God\" (Wisd. 9:4, 10, 12). Delitzsch regards the second hemistich as giving a warning (consequent on the former clause), and not stating a fact, \"In the judgment his mouth should not err.\" The present chapter contains many admonitions to kings which a wise father like Solomon may have uttered and recorded for the benefit of his son. If this is the case, it is as strange as it is true that Rehoboam made little use of the counsels, and that Solomon's latter days gave the lie to many of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA just weight and balance are the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag are his work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A just weight and balance are the Lord's (Proverbs 11:1); literally, the balance and scales of justice (are) the Lord's. They come under his law, are subject to the Divine ordinances which regulate all man's dealings. The great principles of truth end justice govern all the transactions of buying and selling; religion enters into the business of trading, and weights and measures are sacred things. Vulgate, \"The weights and the balance are judgments of the Lord;\" being true and fair, they are regarded as God's judgment. Septuagint, \"The turn of the balance is justice before God.\" All the weights of the bag are his work. Some have round a difficulty here, because the bag may contain false as well as true weights (Deuteronomy 25:13), and it could not be said that the light weights were the Lord's work. This surely is captious criticism. The maxim merely states that the trader's weights take their origin and authority from God's enactment, from certain eternal principles which he has established. What man's chicanery and fraud make of them does not come into view. (For the law that regulates such matters, see Leviticus 19:35, etc.) That cheating in this respect was not uncommon we learn from the complaints of the prophets, as Micah 6:11. The religious character of the standard weights and measures is shown by the term \"shekel of the sanctuary\" (Exodus 38:24, and elsewhere continually).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness. This and the following verse give the ideal view of the monarch - that which he ought to be rather than what be is (comp. Psalm 72.). Certainly neither Solomon nor many of his successors exhibited this high character. The Septuagint, followed by some modern commentators, translates, \"He who doeth wickedness is an abomination to kings;\" but as the \"righteousness\" in the second clause (the throne is established by righteousness) undoubtedly refers to the king, so it is more natural to take the \"wickedness\" in the first member as being his own, not his subjects'. When a ruler acts justly and wisely, punishes the unruly, rewards the virtuous, acts as God's vicegerent, and himself sets the example of the character which becomes so high a position, he wins the affection of his people, they willingly obey him. and are ready to die for him and his family (comp. Proverbs 25:5; Isaiah 16:5). Lawmakers should not be law breakers.

The ideal king takes pleasure in the truth and justice which his subjects display in their conversation. Such a one hates flattery and dissimulation, and encourages honest speaking. They (kings) love him that speaketh right; that which is just (Proverbs 8:6). The two clauses are coordinate. Septuagint, \"He loveth upright words\" (comp. Proverbs 22:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The wrath of a king is as messengers of death. In a despotic monarchy the death of an offender follows quickly on the offence. Anger the king, and punishment is at hand; instruments are always ready who will carry out the sentence, and that before time is given for reconsideration. The murder of Thomas a Becket will occur as an illustration (comp. Esther 7:8, etc). The LXX. translates, \"The king's wrath is a messenger of death,\" taking the plural as put by enallage for the singular; but possibly the plural may intimate the many agents who are prepared to perform the ruler's behests, and the various means which he possesses for punishing offenders. This first clause implies, without expressly saying, that, such being the case, none but a fool will excite the monarch's resentment (comp. Ecclesiastes 8:4); then the second clause comes in naturally. But a wise man will pacify it. He will take care not to provoke that anger which gluts its resentment so quickly and so fatally (Proverbs 19:12; Proverbs 20:2). Septuagint, \"A wise man will appease him,\" the king; as Jacob propitiated Esau by the present which he sent forward (Genesis 32:20, 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - In the light of the king's countenance is life (Proverbs 15:30; Psalm 4:6). As the king's anger and the darkening of his countenance are death (ver. 14), so, when his look is cheerful and bright, it sheds joy and life around, as the rain refreshes the parched ground. A cloud of the latter rain. The former rain in Palestine falls about the end of October or the beginning of November, when the seed is sown; the latter rain comes in March or April, and is absolutely necessary for the due swelling and ripening of the grain. It is accompanied, of course) with cloud, which tempers the heat, while it brings fertility and vigour. To this the king's favour is well compared. \"He shall come down,\" says the psalmist, \"like the rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth\" (Psalm 72:6). The LXX., reading בני (beni) for פני (peni), translates, \"In the light of life is the son of the king; and they who are acceptable to him are as a cloud of the latter rain.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To get wisdom than gold (comp, Proverbs 3:14; Proverbs 8:10, 11, 19); and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver; Revised Version better, yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than [to get] silver. If the clauses are not simply parallel, and the comparative value of silver and gold is So be considered, we may, with Wordsworth, see here an intimation of the superiority of wisdom (chochmah) over intelligence (binah), the former being the guide of life and including the practice of religion, the latter denoting discernment, the faculty of distinguishing between one thing and another (see note on Proverbs 28:4, and the quotation from 'Pirke Aboth' on Proverbs 15:33). The LXX., for kenoh reading kinnot, have given a version of which the Fathers have largely availed themselves: \"The nests of wisdom are preferable to gold, and the nests of knowledge are preferable above silver.\" Some of the old commentators take these \"nests\" to be the problems and apothegms which enshrine wisdom; others consider them to mean the children or scholars who are taught by the wise man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. To avoid the dangerous byways to which evil leads, one must walk straight in the path of duty (comp. Proverbs 15:19). Septuagint, \"The paths of life decline from evil;\" and this version adds some paragraphs in illustration, which are not in the Hebrew: \"And the ways of righteousness are length of life. He who receiveth instruction will be among the good [or, 'in prosperity,' ἐν ἀγαθοῖς], and he who observeth reproof shall become wise.\" He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. He who continues in the right way, and looks carefully to his goings, will save himself from ruin and death (Proverbs 13:3). Septuagint, \"He who watcheth his own ways keepeth his life.\" And then is added another maxim, \"He that loveth his life will spare his mouth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Pride goeth before destruction. A maxim continually enforced (see Proverbs 11:2; Proverbs 17:19; Proverbs 18:12). Here is the contrast to the blessing on humility promised (Proverbs 15:33). A haughty spirit - a lifting up of spirit - goeth before a fall (comp. Daniel 4:29, etc). Thus, according to Herodotus (7:10), Artabanus warned the arrogant Xerxes, \"Seest thou how God strikes with the thunder animals which overtop others, and suffers them not to vaunt themselves, but the small irritate him not? And seest thou how he hurls his bolts always against the mightiest buildings and the loftiest trees? For God is wont to cut short whatever is too highly exalted\" (comp. Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:10.9, etc.). Says the Latin adage, \"Qui petit alta nimis, retro lapsus ponitur imis.\" Caesar, 'Bell. Gall.,' 1:14, \"Consuesse Deos immortales, quo gravius homines ex commutatione rerum doleant, quos pro sceiere eorum ulcisci velint, his secundiores interdum re, et diuturuiorem impunitatem concedere.\" The Chinese say, \"Who flies not high falls not low;\" and, \"A great tree attracts the wind.\" The Basque proverb remarks, \"Pride sought flight in heaven, fell to hell.\" And an Eastern one, \"What is extended will tear; what is long will break\" (Lane).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - This verse is connected in thought, as well as verbally, with the preceding. Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly. The Revised Version has, with the poor; but \"meek\" or \"lowly\" better contrasts with \"proud\" of the second clause. Psalm 84:10, \"I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.\" Than to divide the spoil with the proud. To share in the fruits of the operations and pursuits of the proud, and to enjoy their pleasures, a man must cast in his lot with them, uudergo their risks and anxieties, and participate in the crimes by which they gain their wealth. The result of such association was told in ver. 18. The Germans express the connection between abundance and folly by the terse apothegm, \"Voll, toll;\" \"Full, fool.\" Septuagint, \"Better is the man of gentle mind with humility, than he who divideth spoil with the violent.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He that handleth a matter wisely. Dabar, translated \"matter,\" is better rendered \"word,\" as in Proverbs 13:13, with which passage the present is in contrast. Thus Revised Version, he that giveth heed unto the word. Shall find good; Vulgate, eruditus in verbo reperiet bona. The \"Word\" is the Law of God; he who attends to this shall prosper. The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint, \"The man prudent in affairs is a finder of good things;\" he attends to his business, and thinks out the best mode of accomplishing his plans, and therefore succeeds in a worldly sense (comp. Proverbs 17:20). Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he; or, hail to him, as in Proverbs 14:21. To heed the Word and to trust in the Lord are correlative things; handling a matter wisely can hardly belong to the same category. The Septuagint contrasts the worldly success of one who manages business wisely and discreetly with the blessedness of him who, when he has done all, commits his cause to God and trusts wholly to him: \"He who hath trusted in the Lord is blessed (μακαριστός).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The wise in heart shall be called prudent. True wisdom is recognized and acknowledged as such, especially when it has the gift of expressing itself appropriately (see on Proverbs 24:8). The sweetness (Proverbs 27:9) of the lips increaseth learning. People listen to instruction at the mouth of one who speaks well and winningly. Such a one augments knowledge in others, and in himself too, for he learns by teaching. Knowledge ought not to be buried in one's own mind, but produced on fit occasions and in suitable words for the edification of others. Ecclus. 20:30, \"Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?\" (see Matthew 5:15). Septuagint, \"The wise and prudent they call worthless (φαύλους); but they who are sweet in word shall hear more.\" Wise men are called bad and worthless by the vulgar herd, either because they do not impart all they know, or because they are envied fear their learning; but those who are eloquent and gracious in speech shall receive much instruction from what they bear, every one being ready to converse with them anal impart any knowledge which they possess.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnderstanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Understanding is a well spring of life unto him that hath it (Proverbs 10:11; Proverbs 13:14). The possessor of understanding has in himself a source of comfort and a vivifying power, which is as refreshing as a cool spring to a thirsty traveller. In all troubles and difficulties he can fall back upon his own good sense and prudence, and satisfy himself therewith. This is not conceit, but the result of a well grounded experience. But the instruction of fools is folly; i.e. the instruction which fools give is folly and sin; such is the only teaching which they can offer. So the Vulgate, doctrina stultorum fatuitas; and many modern commentators. But musar is better taken in the sense of \"discipline\" or \"chastisement\" (as in Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 7:22; Proverbs 15:5), which the bad man suffers. His own folly is the scourge which punishes him; refusing the teaching of wisdom, he makes misery for himself, deprives himself of the happiness which virtue gives, and pierces himself through with many sorrows. Septuagint, \"The instruction of tools is evil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth. Out of the abundance of his heart the wise man speaks; the spirit within him finds fit utterance. Pectus est quod disertos facit. The thought and mind control the outward expression and make it eloquent and persuasive (comp. Proverbs 15:2). And addeth learning to his lips; Vulgate, \"addeth grace.\" But lekach, which means properly \"reception,\" \"taking in,\" is best rendered \"learning,\" as in ver. 21; Proverbs 1:5, etc. The intellect and knowledge of the wise display themselves in their discourse. Delitzsch, \"Learning mounteth up to his lips.\" Ecclus. 21:26, \"The heart of fools is in their mouth; but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.\" Septuagint, \"The heart of the wise will consider what proceedeth from his mouth; and on his lips he will carry prudence (ἐπιγνωμοσύνην).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Pleasant words are as an honeycomb. \"Pleasant words\" are words of comforting, soothing tendency, as in ch. 15:26; Psalm 19:10. The writer continues his praise of apt speech. The comparison with honey is common in all languages and at all times. Thus Homer sings of Nestor ('Iliad,' 1:248, etc.) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"The smooth-tongued chief, from whose persuasive lipsNEWLINESweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Derby.) So the story goes that on the lips of St. Ambrose, while still a boy, a swarm of bees settled, portending his future persuasive eloquence. Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones (Proverbs 15:30). The verse forms one sentence. The happy results of pleasant words are felt in body and soul. Honey in Palestine is a staple article of food, and is also used as a medicinal remedy. Of its reviving effects we read in the case of Jonathan, who from a little portion hurriedly taken as he marched on had \"his eyes enlightened\" (1 Samuel 14:27). Septuagint, \"Their sweetness is the healing of the soul.\"NEWLINENEWLINEἸατρὸς ὁ λόγος τοῦ κατά ψυχὴν πάθους.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Speech the physician of the soul's annoy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - A repetition of Proverbs 14:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He that laboureth laboureth for himself; literally, the soul of him that laboureth laboureth for him. \"Soul\" here is equivalent to \"desire,\" \"appetite\" (comp. Proverbs 6:30), and the maxim signifies that hunger is a strong incentive to work - the needs of the body spur the labourer to diligence and assiduity; he eats bread in the sweat of his brow (Genesis 3:19). Says the Latin gnome -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Largitor artium, ingeniique magister Venter.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"The belly is the teacher of all arts,NEWLINEThe parent of invention.\" De tout s'avise a qui pain faut, \"He who wants bread thinks of everything.\" There is our own homely saw, \"Need makes the old wife trot;\" as the Italians say, \"Hunger sets the dog a-hunting\" (Kelly). For his mouth craveth it of him; his mouth must have food to put in it. The verb אָכַפ (akaph) does not occur elsewhere; it means properly \"to bend,\" and then to put a load on, to constrain to press. So here, \"His mouth bends over him, i.e. urgeth him thereto\" (Revised Version). Ecclesiastes 6:7, \"All labour of man is for his mouth;\" we should say stomach. Hunger in some sense is the great stimulus of all work. \"We commanded you,\" says St. Paul (2 Thessalonians 3:10), \"that if any would not work, neither should he eat.\" There is a spiritual hunger without which grace cannot be sought or obtained - that hungering and thirsting after righteousness of which Christ speaks, and which he who is the Bread of life is ready to satisfy (Matthew 5:6; John 6:58). The Septuagint expands the maxim: \"A man in labours labours for himself, and drives away (ἐκβιάζεται) his own destruction; but the perverse man upon his own mouth carrieth destruction.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - This and the three following verses are concerned with the case of the evil man. An ungodly man - a man of Belial - diggeth up evil. A man of Belial (Proverbs 6:12) is a worthless, wicked person, what the French call a vaurien. Such a one digs a pit for others (Proverbs 26:27; Psalm 7:15), devises mischief against his neighbour, plots against him by lying and slandering and overreaching. Wordsworth confines the evil to the man himself; he digs it as treasure in a mine, loves wickedness for its own sake. But analogy is against this interpretation. Septuagint, \"A foolish man diggeth evils for himself.\" So Ecclus. 27:26, \"Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.\" As the gnome says -NEWLINENEWLINEἩ δὲ κακὴ βουλὴ τῷ βουλεύσαντι κακίστη. And in his lips there is as a burning fire (Proverbs 26:23) His words scorch and injure like a devouring flame. James 3:6, \"The tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.\" Septuagint, \"And upon his lips he treasureth up fire.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - A froward man soweth strife (Proverbs 6:14, 19). The verb means, literally, \"sends forth,\" which may signify \"scatters as seed\" or \"hurls as a missile weapon.\" The character intended is the perverse man, who distorts the truth, gives a wrong impression, attributes evil motives; such a one occasions quarrels and heartburnings. And a whisperer separateth chief friends (Proverbs 17:9). Nirgan is either \"a chatterer,\" or \"a whisperer,\" \"calumniator.\" In Proverbs 18:8 and Proverbs 26:20, 22 it is translated \"tale bearer.\" \"Be not called a whisperer (ψίθυρος),\" says the Son of Sirach (Ecclus. 5:14), speaking of secret slander. \"Slanderers,\" says an old apothegm, \"are Satan's bellows to blow up contension.\" Septuagint, \"A perverse man sendeth abroad evils, and kindleth a torch of deceit for the wicked, and separateth friends.\" The alternative rendering of the second clause, \"estrangeth a leader,\" i.e. alienates one leader from another, or from his army, is not confirmed by the authority of the versions or the best commentators.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - A violent man enticeth his neighbour. The man of violence (Proverbs 3:31) is one who wrongs others by injurious conduct, by fraud or oppression. How such a one \"enticeth,\" talks a man over, we see in Proverbs 1:10, etc. Septuagint, \"The lawless man tempts (ἀποπειρᾶται) friends.\" And leadeth him into the way that is not good (Psalm 36:4; Isaiah 65:2); a position where he will suffer some calamity, or be induced to commit some wickedness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - This verse is better taken as one sentence (so the Septuagint), and translated, as Nowack, \"He that shutteth his eyes in order to contrive froward things, he that compresseth his lips, hath already brought evil to pass;\" he has virtually effected it. From such a crafty, malignant man you need not expect any more open tokens of his intentions. He shutteth his eyes (comp. Isaiah 33:15); either that he may better think out his evil plans, or else he cannot look his neighbour in the face while he is plotting against him. The Vulgate has, attonitis oculis; Septuagint, \"fixing (στηρίζων) his eyes.\" Moving his lips; rather, he who compresseth his lips, to hide the malignant smile with which he might greet his neighbour's calamity (comp. Proverbs 6:13, etc.; Proverbs 10:10), or that neither by word nor expression he may betray his thoughts. Others take the two outward expressions mentioned as signals to confederates; but this is not so suitable, as they are the man's own feelings and sentiments that are meant. One who gives these tokens bringeth evil to pass; he has perfected his designs, and deems them as good as accomplished, and you will do well to note what his bearing signifies. Some take the meaning to be, brings punishment on himself; but the warning is not given for the sinner's sake. Septuagint, \"He defines (ὀρίζει) all evils with his lips; he is a furnace of evil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The hoary head is a crown of glory (Proverbs 20:29). (For \"crown,\" see on Proverbs 17:6.) Old age is the reward of a good life, and therefore is an honour to a man (comp. Proverbs 3:2, 16; Proverbs 4:10; Proverbs 9:11; Proverbs 10:27). If it be found - rather, it shall be found - in the way of righteousness; the guerdon of obedience and holiness; whereas \"bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days\" (Psalm 55:23). It is well said in the Book of Wisdom (4, 5, etc.), \"Honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - He that is slow to anger (Proverbs 14:29) is better than the mighty. The long suffering, non-irascible man is more of a hero than the valiant commander of a great army. One overcomes external foes or obstacles; the other conquers himself; as it is said, And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city (Proverbs 25:28). 'Pirke Aboth,' 4:1, \"Who is the hero? The man that restrains his thoughts.\" Maxims about self-mastery are common enough. Says an unknown poet, \"Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia, nec virtus altius ire potest.\" So Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 795, \"Fortior est qui cupiditates suas, quam qui hostes subjicit.\" And the mediaeval jingle -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Linguam fraenareNEWLINEPlus est quam castra domare.\" At the end of this verse the Alexandrian Manuscript of the Septuagint, followed by later hands in some other uncials, adds, \"and a man having prudence [is better] than a great farm.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs16:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The lot is cast into the lap. The bosom or fold of the garment (Proverbs 6:27; Proverbs 17:23; Proverbs 21:14). It is not quite clear what articles the Jews used in their divinations by lot. Probably they employed stones, differing in shape or colour, or having some distinguishing mark. These were placed in a vessel or in the fold of a garment, and drawn or shaken thence. Such a practice has been common in all ages and countries; and though only cursorily mentioned in the Mosaic legislation (Numbers 26:55), it was used by the Jews from the time of Joshua, and in the earliest days of the Christian Church (see Joshua 18:10; Judges 20:9; 1 Samuel 10:20, 21; Acts 1:28, etc.). As by this means man's agency was minimized, and all partiality and chicanery were excluded, the decision was regarded as directed by Providence. There is one case only of ordeal in the Law, and that under suspicion of adultery (Numbers 5:12, etc.). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, in place of the lot we read (Hebrews 6:16), \"An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.\" The whole disposing thereof is of the Lord. In these cases the Jew learned to see, in what we call chance, the overruling of Divine power. But this was not blind superstition. He did not feel justified in resorting to this practice on every trivial occasion, as persons used the Sortes Virgilianae or even the verses of the Bible for the same purpose. The lot was employed religiously in cases where other means of decision were not suitable or available; it was not to supersede common prudence or careful investigation; but, for example, in trials where the evidence was conflicting and the judges could not determine the case, the merits were ascer-rained by lot (comp. ch. 18:18). After the effusion of the Holy Spirit, the apostles never resorted to divination, and the Christian Church has wisely repudiated the practice of all such modes of discovering the Divine will. Septuagint, \"For the unrighteous all things fall into their bosom, but from the Lord are all just things,\" which may mean either that, though the wicked seem to prosper, God still works out his righteous ends; or the evil suffer retribution, and thus God's justice is displayed.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - (Comp, Proverbs 15:16, 17; Proverbs 16:8.) Better (sweeter) is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith. Dry bread was soaked in wine or water before it was eaten. Thus Boaz bid Ruth \"dip her morsel in the vinegar\" (Ruth 2:14); thus Jesus gave the sop to Judas when he had dipped it (John 13:26). The Septuagint is pleonastic, \"Better is a morsel with joy in peace.\" Aben Ezra connects this verse with the last two of ch. 16, confining the application to the patient man; but the sentence seems rather to be independent and general. Than an house full of sacrifices with strife. Of the thank or peace offerings part only was burnt upon the altar, the rest was eaten by the offerer and his family; and as the victims were always the choicest animals, \"a house full of sacrifices\" would contain the materials for sumptuous feasting (see on Proverbs 7:4). The joyous family festival often degenerated into excess, which naturally led to quarrels and strife (see 1 Samuel 1:5, 6, 13; 1 Samuel 2:13, etc.). So the agapae of the early Church were desecrated by licence and selfishness (1 Corinthians 11:20, etc.). Septuagint, \"than a house full of many good things and unrighteous victims with contention.\" With this verse compare the Spanish proverb, \"Mas vale un pedazo de pan con amor, que gallinas con dolor.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame. Here is intimated the supremacy of wisdom over folly and vice. The contrast is better emphasized by translating, A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that doeth shamefully; i.e. a son of his master. (For similar contrast between \"wise\" and \"shameful,\" comp. Proverbs 10:5; Proverbs 14:35.) Slaves were often raised to high honour, and might inherit their master's possessions. Thus Abraham's servant, Eliezer of Damascus, was at one time considered the patriarch's heir (Genesis 15:2, 3); Ziba, Saul's servant, obtained the inheritance of his lord Mephibosheth (\"the Shameful,\" 2 Samuel 16:4); Joseph was advanced to the highest post in Egypt. Ecclus. 10:25, \"Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service; and he that is wise will not grudge when he is reformed.\" Septuagint, \"A wise household servant shall rule over foolish masters.\" \"I have seen,\" says Ecelesiastes (Ecclesiastes 10:7), \"servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.\" Shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren; shall share on equal terms with the sons of the house. This innovation on the usual disposition of property could happen only in the case of an abnormally intelligent and trusted slave. In 1 Chronicles 2:34, etc., mention is made of a case where a master, having no son, gave his daughter in marriage to a slave, and adopted him into the family. Delitzsch understands the clause to mean that the slave shall have the office of dividing his master's inheritance among the heirs, shall be the executor of his deceased master's will; but this explanation hardly seems to do justice to the merits of the \"wise servant,\" and takes no account of the idea involved in \"shameful son.\" But the Septuagint appears to countenance this view, rendering, \"and among the brethren he shall divide the portions.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold. The word matsreph, \"fining pot,\" occurs also in Proverbs 27:21. It is not certain what is meant by it. There is no evidence that the Israelites were acquainted with the use of acids in the manipulation of impure or mixed metals; otherwise the \"pot\" and the \"furnace\" would represent the two usual modes of reduction; but it is most probable that both allude to the same method of smelting the ore in crucibles, for the purpose of separating the pure metal from the dross. That silver and gold were plentiful in Solomon's time is abundantly evident; indeed, the amount of the precious metals collected by David and his son is almost incredible (see 1 Chronicles 22:14; 1 Chronicles 29:2, etc., from which and similar passages it is inferred that the sums enumerated equalled more than nine hundred millions of pounds sterling). But the Lord trieth the hearts (Proverbs 15:11; Proverbs 24:12). That which fire does for the metals, the Lord does for men's hearts; he purifies them from dross, brings forth the good that is in them, purged from earthly infirmities. God's process is the application of sorrow, sickness, temptation, that, duly meeting these, the soul may emerge from the trial as pure gold, fit for the Master's use (comp. Jeremiah 12:3; Malachi 3:2; 1 Peter 1:7; Revelation 3:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A wicked doer giveth heed to false (evil) lips. A bad man delights in and hearkens to evil words; he takes pleasure in those who counsel wickedness, because they are after his own heart. Like mates with like. And a liar giveth ear to a naughty (mischievous) tongue. One who is himself mendacious listens with avidity to any tale that may injure a neighbour. however monstrous and improbable it may be. Septuagint, \"A wicked man listens to the tongue of transgressors; but a just man heedeth not false lips.\" The Greek adds here, or in some manuscripts, after ver. 6, a paragraph which is not found in the Hebrew, Syriac, or Latin: \"To him who is faithful the whole world wealth belongs; but the unfaithful is not worth an obole.\" On this the Fathers have frequently commented (see Corn. a Lapide, in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Whoso mocketh the poor (see Proverbs 14:31, which is nearly identical). He that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished (Proverbs 11:21; Proverbs 24:17, 18). The particular calamity primarily intended seems to be that which reduces a person to poverty. Delight in others' misfortunes, even those of enemies, is a most detestable form of selfishness and malice. Job, testifying to his own integrity, was thankful to think that he was free from this vice (Job 31:29). The Greeks had a name for it, and called it ἐπιχαιρεκακία, which is used by Aristotle ('Eth. Nic.,' 2:6. 18). The pious author looks for retributive punishment on such spitefulness. The LXX. tries to improve the contrast by resorting a gloss, \"He who rejoices at one who perishes shall not go unpunished; but he who hath compassion shall obtain mercy,\" which is remarkably like Christ's sentence, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTChildren's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Children's children are the crown of old men (comp. Psalm 127; Psalm 128). (For the term \"crown,\" comp. Proverbs 16:18.) Thus St. Paul calls his converts his \"joy and crown\" (Philippians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 2:19) In the East a large number of children is considered a great blessing, being a guarantee of the stability of the family. Thus writes Euripides ('Iph. Taur.,' 57) -NEWLINENEWLINEΣτύλοι γὰρ οἴκων παῖδες εἰσιν ἄρσενεςNEWLINENEWLINE\"Male children are the pillars of the house.\" The glory of children are their fathers. A long line of good or celebrated ancestors is the glory of their descendants, and brings a blessing on them (see 1 Kings 11:13; 1 Kings 15:4). Hereditary nobility, based on descent from some eminent progenitor, may be a source of not unseemly pride, and a spur to a life worthy of such excellent ancestry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExcellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Excellent speech becometh not a fool. שְׂפַת יָתֶר; verba composita, Vulgate, i.e. studied, complicated, expressions; χείλη πιστά, \"faithful lips,\" Septuagint. Others translate, \"arrogant,\" \"pretentious.\" It is literally, a lip of excess or superabundance, and is best taken in the above sense, as arrogant or assuming. A nabal, a \"vicious fool,\" ought not to flaunt his unwisdom and his iniquities before the eyes of men, but to keep them hidden as much as possible. As such presumptuous behaviour is incongruous in the case of a fool, much less do lying lips [become] a prince; a noble person, such a one as is called in Isaiah (Isaiah 32:8) \"liberal,\" where the same word, nadib, is used. This is an illustration of the saying, \"Noblesse oblige.\" Thus the Greek gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEἘλευθέρου γὰρ ἀνδρὸς ἀλήθειαν λέγεινNEWLINENEWLINE\"A free man's part it is the truth to speak.\" To John the Good, King of France, is attributed the noble maxim which well became his chivalrous character, \"Si la bonne foi etait bannie du reste du monde, il faudrait qu'on la retrouvat dans le coeur des rois\" (Bonnechose, 'Hist. de France,' 1:310). \"My son,\" says the rabbi in the Talmud, \"avoid lying first of all; for a lie will tarnish the brightness of thy honour.\" For \"prince,\" the Septuagint has, \"a just man,\" which makes the maxim a mere truism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - There is a breath of satire in this verse. A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it. \"A precious stone\" is literally \"a stone of grace\" (Proverbs 1:9). The gnome expresses the idea that a bribe is like a bright jewel that dazzles the sight and affects the mind of him who receives it (see on Proverbs 15:27; comp. Deuteronomy 16:19; 1 Samuel 12:3). Ovid, 'Art. Amat.,' 3:653 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Munera, crede mihi, capiunt hominesque deosque;NEWLINEPlacatur donis Jupiter ipse datis.\" It is possible that the gnome may have a more general application, and apply to gifts given to appease anger or to prove friendship (Proverbs 19:6; Proverbs 21:14). Septuagint, \"A reward of graces is discipline to those who use it;\" i.e. moral discipline brings an ample reward of graces to those who practise it. Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. The Authorized Version refers these words to the gift. Delitzsch points out that the words are more properly taken of the person who receives the gift, so that they should be rendered, \"Wheresoever he turneth himself he dealeth wisely.\" Inflamed by sordid hopes and the love of gain, he acts with all possible skill and prudence in order to work out his wages and show that he was rightly selected to receive the present. The verse merely states a common trait among unscrupulous men, and pronounces no judgment upon it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; i.e. strives to exercise, put in practice, love (comp. Zephaniah 2:8; 1 Corinthians 14:4). Thus Nowack. One who bears patiently and silently, extenuates and conceals, something done or said against him, that man follows after charity, obeys the great law of love (comp. Proverbs 10:12). Some explain the clause to mean, \"procures love for himself;\" but the second member certainly is not personal, therefore it is more natural to take the first in a general sense. He that repeateth (harpeth on) a matter separateth very friends (Proverbs 16:28). He who is always dwelling on a grievance, returning to it and bringing it forward on every occasion, alienates the greatest friends, only embitters the injury and makes it chronic. Ecclus. 19:7, etc., \"Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men's lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not. For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee. If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee.\" So the rabbis said: \"Abstain from quarrels with thy neighbour; and if thou hast seen something bad of thy friend, let it not pass thy tongue as a slander\" (Dukes, § 61). The Mosaic Law had led the way to this duty of forbearance: \"Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\" (Leviticus 19:18). Septuagint, \"He who concealeth injuries seeketh friendship; but he who hateth to conceal them separateth friends and households.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A reproof entereth more (deeper) into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. A deserved rebuke makes a deeper impression upon a man of understanding than the severest chastisement upon a fool. Hitzig quotes Sallust, 'Jug.,' 11, \"Verbum in pectus Jugurthae altius, quam quisquam ratus est, descendit.\" Quint. Curt., 54:7, \"Nobilis equus umbra quoque virgae regitur, ignavus ne calcari quidem concitari potest.\" The antithesis is put more forcibly in the Septuagint, \"A threat breaks the heart of a prudent man; a fool even scourged feels it not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - An evil man seeketh only rebellion. So the Greek and Latin Versions; but, as Nowack intimates, a bad man seeks many other things which do not come directly in the category of rebellion; and it is better to take meri, \"rebellion,\" as the subject, regarding it as put for the concrete, thus: \"A rebellious man striveth only for what is evil.\" From the point of view of an Eastern potentate, this is true enough. Absolute government looks upon any rising against constituted authority, any movement in the masses, as necessarily evil, and to be repressed with a high hand. Hence the succeeding clause. Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. The \"cruel messenger\" (Proverbs 16:14) is the executioner of the king's wrath (comp. 1 Kings 2:29, etc.). He is called \"cruel\" because his errand is deadly, and he is pitiless in its performance. This seems to be the sense intended. The LXX. gives a different notion, derived from the ambiguous term malak, like the Greek ἄγγελος: \"The Lord will send forth a pitiless angel against him.\" The verse then becomes a statement concerning the retribution inflicted by God on obstinate sinners, such as Pharaoh and the Egyptians. These are delivered over to \"the tormentors\" (Matthew 18:34), the angels that execute the wrath of God, as in Psalm 78:49 and Revelation 8:6, etc. As all sin is rebellion against God, it is natural to read into the passage a religious meaning, and for homiletical purposes it is legitimate to do so. But the writer's intention is doubtless as explained above, though his language may be divinely directed to afford a further application.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man. The Syrian bear was once common throughout Palestine; it is now found in but few localities, such as the hills of Hermon and Lebanon, and in the hills east of the Jordan, the destruction of wood and forest having deprived these animals of the shelter necessary to their existence. The ferocity of the bear when deprived of its young had become proverbial (see 2 Samuel 17:8; Hosea 13:8; Hart, 'Animals of the Bible,' 28, etc.). Rather than a fool in his folly; i.e. in the paroxysm of his passion. Compare Saul's ungoverned language to Jonathan (1 Samuel 20:30), and Herod's murder of the children (Matthew 2:16). So we read of the people being filled with ἄνοια against Jesus (Luke 6:11). Oort supposes that this proverb arose from the riddle, \"What is worse to meet than a bear?\" Septuagint, \"Care will fall upon a man of understanding; but fools imagine evils.\" The Greek translators take \"bear\" as us d metaphorically for terror and anxiety, but go far astray from the Hebrew text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Whoso rewardeth evil for good. This was David's complaint of the churlish Nabal (1 Samuel 25:21). Ingratitude shall surely he punished. Evil shall not depart from his house. Terribly has the ingratitude of the Jews been visited. They cried in their madness, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\" and their punishment is still going on. Injunctions on this subject are frequent in the New Testament (see Matthew 5:39; Romans 12:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:15; 1 Peter 3:9). The Talmud says, \"Do not throw a stone into the well whose waters you have drunk.\" The Greeks felt the sting of ingratitude. Thus Leiodes complains to Ulysses ('Od.,' 22:319) -NEWLINENEWLINEὩς οὐκ ἔστι χάρις μετόπισθ εὐεργέων Two sayings of Publius Syrus are quoted ('Sent.,' vv. 219, 274): \"Ingratus unus omnibus miseris nocet;\" \"Malignos fieri maxime ingrati docent.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water. The small rift in the bank of a reservoir of water, if not immediately secured, is soon enlarged and gets beyond control, occasioning widespread ruin and destruction; so from small and insignificant causes, which might at first have been easily checked, arise feuds and quarrels which extend in a wide circle, and cannot be appeased. Palestine was largely dependent upon its reservoirs for the storage of water, perennial springs being of rare occurrence. The three pools of Solomon in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, which were connected by channels with Jerusalem, are still to be seen in all their massive grandeur; and, indeed, every town had its reservoir, or tank, as we find in India at the present time. These receptacles had to be kept in good repair, or disastrous consequences might ensue. On the tendency of a quarrel to grow to a dangerous extent, a Bengal proverb speaks of \"going in a needle and coming out a ploughshare.\" Vulgate, Qui dimittit aquam, caput est jurgiorum, which seems to mean that the man who needlessly lets the water of a cistern run to waste gives occasion to quarrels. But St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:13), commenting on the passage, interprets differently: \"It is well said by Solomon, 'He that letteth out water is a head of strife.' For the water is let out when the flowing of the tongue is let loose. And he that letteth out water is made the beginning of strife, in that, by the incontinency of the lips, the commencement of discord is afforded\" (Oxford transl.). Probably, however, in the Latin, as in the Hebrew, the particle of comparison is suppressed, so that the clause means, \"As he who lets out water, so is he who gives occasion to strife.\" Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. The last word חַתְלַֺגּלַּע is of doubtful interpretation. It occurs in Proverbs 18:1 and Proverbs 20:3, and is variously translated, \"before it rushes forward,\" \"before it grows warm,\" \"before a man becomes wrathful.\" But Hitzig, Nowaek, and others take it to signify, \"before men show their teeth,\" like angry dogs snarling at one another. The moralist advises men to subdue angry passions at once before they become exacerbated. The Vulgate seems to have quite mistaken the clause, translating, Antequam patiatur contumeliam, judicium deserit, which seems to mean that a patient, peace-loving man (in contrast with the irascible) avoids lawsuits before he is involved in a lasting quarrel. Septuagint, \"The beginning (ἀρχὴ) of justice gives power to words; but discord and contention lead the way to want.\" The Greek commentators see here an allusion to the clepsydra, the water clock which regulated the length of the speeches in a court of law; but the reference is by no means clear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He that justifieth - in a forensic sense, declares righteous, acquits - the wicked, etc. Two forms of the perversion of justice are censured, viz. the acquittal of a guilty person and the condemnation of an innocent one (comp. Proverbs 24:24; Isaiah 5:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom? A fool thinks that there is a royal road to wisdom, and that it, like other things, is to be purchased with reentry. Vulgate, Quid prodest stulto habere divitias, cum sapientiam emere non possit? The rabbis in later time were not allowed to take fees for teaching; but it was customary to make offerings to seers and wise men, when their services were engaged or their advice was asked (see the case of Saul and Samuel, 1 Samuel 9:7, 8). The last clause gives the reason why it is useless for a fool to try to learn wisdom even at a large expenditure on teachers. Seeing he hath no heart to it; i.e. no capability for receiving it; his mental digestion cannot assimilate it. The heart, as we have already noticed, is regarded as the seat of the understanding. Thus the LXX., \"Why doth a fool have wealth? for a man without heart cannot acquire wisdom.\" In the Gospel Christ calls his disciples \"fools and slow of heart to believe what the prophets had written, and himself opened their mind (τὸν νοῦν), that they might understand the Scriptures\" (Luke 24:25, 45). The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a distich derived from portions of vers. 19, 20, \"He who raises his house high seeketh destruction; and he who perversely declineth from learning (ὁ δὲ σκολιάζων τοῦ μαθεῖν) shall fall into evils.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. Some find a climax in the two clauses, and translate the last as Revised Version margin, \"And is born as a brother for adversity,\" the same person being meant in both members of the sentence. A real friend loves his friend in prosperity and adversity; yea, he is more than a friend in time of need - he is a brother, as affectionate and as trusty as one connected by the closest ties of relationship (comp. Proverbs 18:24). Siracides gives a very cruel version of this proverb, \"A friend cannot be known in prosperity; and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved; but in his adversity even a friend will depart\" (Ecclus. 12:8, etc.). Cicero had a truer notion of the stability of friendship when he quoted Ennius's dictum, \"Amicus certus in re incerta cernitur\" ('De Amicit.,' 17.). Misfortune, says our maxim, is the touchstone of friendship; and one Greek gnome enjoins -NEWLINENEWLINEἸδίας νόμιζε τῶν φίλων τὰς συμφοράςNEWLINENEWLINE\"Thy friend's misfortunes deem to be thine own;\"NEWLINENEWLINEwhile another runs -NEWLINENEWLINEΚρίνει φίλους ὁ καιρὸς ὥς χρυσὸν τὸ πῦρ.NEWLINENEWLINE\"The crisis tests a friend, as fire the gold.\" Septuagint, \"Have thou a friend forevery crisis, and let brethren be useful in adversities; for for this they are made.\" Commenting on the expression, \"is born,\" Wordsworth fancifully remarks, \"Adversity brings him forth. He comes, as it were, out of the womb of calamity, and seems to be born for it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A man void of understanding (Hebrew, heart) striketh hands; clinches the bargain which makes him responsible (see on suretyship, Proverbs 6:1, etc.; and note, Proverbs 20:16). Becometh surety in the presence of his friend; to his friend for some third party. What is here censured is the weakness which, for the sake of perhaps worthless companions, lets itself be hampered and endangered by others' obligations. For, as our adage runs, he that is surety for another is never sure himself. The Septuagint takes the \"striking of hands\" to be a sign of joy (Vulgate, plaudet manibus), \"The foolish man claps (ἐπικροτεῖ) and rejoices in himself, so also he who pledges himself for his friend.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He loveth transgression that loveth strife, because strife leads to many breaches of the commandments (comp. Proverbs 29:22; James 1:20). Septuagint, \"He who loveth sin rejoices in battles.\" And he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. He who builds a sumptuous house and lives in the way that his magnificent surroundings demand draws ruin on himself, either because he affects a state which he is unable to support, or acts so as to provoke reprisals and injurious consequences. The entrance to a Palestinian house would usually be of humble dimensions and sparse ornamentation; any doorway of great architectural pretensions would be uncommon, and would be regarded as a token of extraordinary wealth or reprehensible pride. Aben Ezra, taking \"gate\" as a metaphor for \"mouth,\" explains the hemistich of the danger of random or excessive speech. This makes a good parallel with the first clause; but it is doubtful whether the words will bear this interpretation (see Hitzig); and the two clauses may present two forms of selfishness, captiousness and ostentation, both of which lead to quarrels and ruin (comp. Proverbs 16:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He that hath a froward heart findeth no good. (For \"froward,\" see on Proverbs 11:20; for \"find good,\" on Proverbs 16:20.) The perverse, wilful man shall not prosper, shall win no blessing in his worldly matters, much less in spiritual things. Septuagint, \"He who is hard of heart meeteth not with good things.\" He that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief; literally, he who turns himself about with his tongue, saying one thing at one time and something quite contrary at another. Vulgate, qui vertit linguam; Septuagint, ἀνὴρ εὐμετάβολος γλώσσῃ, \"easily changed in tongue\" (comp. Proverbs 8:13; Proverbs 10:31, where the word is different). \"Mischief\" (ra) \"is trouble,\" \"calamity,\" as in Proverbs 13:17. Speaking of the various aspects which words may assume, Cato ('Dist.,' 4:20) says -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Sermo hominum mores et celat et indicat idem.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Man's words his character reveal,NEWLINEBut often they his mind conceal?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow (comp. ver. 25). The words for \"fool\" in the two clauses are different. Here it is kesil, which implies bold, self-confident folly, the worst form of the vies; in the second hemistich it is nabal, which rather denotes dulness and stupidity, a want of mental power. A conceited, offensive fool causes infinite trouble to his father, both from his need of constant correction, and the watchfulness required to repair the consequences of his foolish actions. There is also the grief at seeing instruction and warning thrown away on a worthless object. Septuagint, \"The heart of a fool is a pain to him who possesseth it.\" The father of a fool hath no joy. The contrast in the case of a good son is seen in Proverbs 15:20 and Proverbs 23:24. The LXX. adds a clause from Proverbs 10:1, with the view of improving the parallelism, \"But a prudent son rejoiceth his mother.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A merry heart doeth good like a medicine. So Aben Ezra, understanding the particle of comparison, which is not in the Hebrew. The ward translated \"medicine\" (gehah) occurs nowhere else, and probably means \"healing\" \"relief.\" The clause is better rendered, a cheerful heart maketh a good healing (comp. Proverbs 15:13; Proverbs 16:25). Vulgate, aetatem floridam facit; Septuagint, εὐεκτεῖν ποιεῖ, \"makes one to be in good case.\" A cheerful, contented disposition enables a men to resist the attacks of disease, the mind, ms every one knows, having most powerful influence over the body. Ecclus. 30:22, \"The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.\" A broken spirit drieth the bones; destroys all life and vigour (comp. Proverbs 3:8; Psalm 22:15; Psalm 32:4). We all remember the distich -NEWLINENEWLINE\"A merry heart goes all the day,NEWLINEYour sad tires in a mile-a.\" So the rabbis enjoin, \"Give ears no room in thine heart, for care hath killed many\" (Dukes, p. 68). Religious gladness is a positive duty, and \"low spirits,\" as Isaac Williams says, \"are a sin.\" Asks the Greek moralist -NEWLINENEWLINEἌρ ἐστὶ συγγενές τι λύπη καὶ βίος And Lucretius (3:473) affirms -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nam dolor ac morbus leti fabricator uterque est.\"NEWLINE\"Workers of death are sorrow and disease.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A gift out of the bosom; i.e. secretly from the fold of the garment, and not from the purse or bag wherein money was ostensibly carried. A corrupt judge \"taketh,\" i.e. receives a bribe conveyed to him secretly (Proverbs 21:14). To pervert the ways of judgment. The judges had no appointed salaries; hence the unprincipled among them were open to bribery. The strict injunctions of the Law, and the stern denunciations of the prophets, were alike ineffectual in checking corruption (see Exodus 23:8; Deuteronomy 16:19; Isaiah 1:23; Jeremiah 22:17; Ezekiel 13:19; Hosea 4:18, etc.). Septuagint, \"The man that receiveth gifts in his bosom unjustly, his ways shall not prosper.\" For, as Job avows (Job 15:34), \"Fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.\" The LXX. adds, \"The impious turns aside from the ways of righteousness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Wisdom is before [the face of] him that hath understanding. The idea is that the intelligent man directs his look towards Wisdom, and therefore she beams upon him with all her light; as the Vulgate puts it, \"In the face of the prudent wisdom shines.\" He has one object to which he directs all his attention (Proverbs 15:14). The Septuagint rendering is not so satisfactory: \"The countenance of a prudent man is wise;\" he shows in his look and bearing the wisdom that guides him. Thus Ecclesiastes 8:1, \"A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.\" The eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. A fool has no one definite object in view; he pursues a hundred different things, as they happen to come in his way, but misses the most important quest of all and fritters away the powers which might have aided him to obtain wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - This verse is more or less a repetition of ver. 21; Proverbs 10:1; Proverbs 15:20; and comp. Proverbs 19:13. A grief (kaas). The Vulgate and Septuagint translate, \"anger.\" A foolish son provokes the wrath of his father, and is bitterness to her that bare him, \"Bitterness\" (memer) oesurs nowhere else; mar and marar are common enough.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Also (gam). This may be intended to connect this verso with what was said above (ver. 23) about the perversion of justice; or, as is more probable, it is used to emphasize what is coming, To punish the just is not good. Damnum inferre justo, Vulgate; ζημιοῦν, Septuagint; and the word has a special reference to punishment by fire. Nor to strike princes for equity; the expression, \"is not good,\" being understood from the former clause. \"Princes\" are the noble in character rather than in position only. Two forms of evil are named, viz. to punish the innocent, and to visit with contumely and injury the man of high character who cannot be induced to pervert justice. Revised Version, nor to smite the noble for their uprightness. So virtually the Vulgate, Septuagint, and Syriac. Another rendering is, \"to strike the noble is against right,\" which seems feeble and less suitable to the parallelism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He that hath knowledge spareth his words; Revised Version, he that spareth his words hath knowledge; he shows his common sense, not by rash talk or saying all he knows, but by restraining his tongue (comp. Proverbs 10:19; James 1:19). 'Pirke Aboth' (1:18), \"All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and have not found aught good for a man but silence; not learning but doing is the groundwork, and whoso multiplies words occasions sin\" Say the Greek gnomes -NEWLINENEWLINEἘνίοις τὸ σιγᾷν ἐστὶ κρεῖττον τοῦ λέγεινNEWLINEΚρεῖττον σιωπᾷν η} λαλεῖν α} μὴ πρέπει And Theognis (5:815) writes -NEWLINENEWLINEΒοῦς μοι ἐπὶ γλώσσης κρατερῷ ποδὶ λὰξ ἐπιβαίνωνNEWLINEἼσχει κωτίλλειν καίπερ ἐπιστάμενον Speech for a shekel, silence for two; it is like a precious stone ('Qoheleth Rabbah,' 5:5). Septuagint, \"He who spareth to utter a harsh speech is prudent\" (ἐπιγνώμων). A man of understanding is of an excellent spirit; Revised Version, he that is of a coot spirit is a man of understanding; i.e. he who considers before he speaks, and never answers in hot haste, proves that he is wise and intelligent. Septuagint, \"The long suffering man is prudent.\" The above is the reading of the Khetib, followed by most interpreters. The Keri gives, \"of a precious spirit\" (pretiosi spiritus, Vulgate), that is, one whose words are weighty and valuable, not lavishly thrown about, but reserved as costly jewels.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs17:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise. Not betraying his ignorance and incapacity by words, a foolish man is credited with possessing sense (comp. Job 13:5). Proverbs to this effect are found in all languages. Thus the Greek -NEWLINENEWLINEΠᾶς τις ἀπαίδευτος φρονιμώτατος ἐστὶ σιωπῶν. Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:3 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Virtutem primam esse puta compescere linguam;NEWLINEProximus ille Deo qui scit ratione tacere.\" Talmud, \"Silence becomes the wise, much more feels.\" The Dutch have appropriated this maxim, \"Zweigen de dwazen zij waren wijs, .... Were fools silent, they would pass for wise.\" \"Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses.\" \"Silence,\" says the Sanskrit gnome, \"is the ornament of the ignorant.\" \"Talking comes by nature,\" say the Germans, \"silence of understanding.\" The LXX. gives a different turn to the first clause: \"A foolish man inquiring of wisdom will have wisdom imputed to him;\" the expressed desire of knowledge will be taken as a proof of intelligence. The second clause is coordinate with the former. He that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding; Revised Version, when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent; Septuagint, \"A man making himself dumb will seem to be prudent.\" Theophrastus is said to have thus addressed a guest who was very silent at table: \"If you are a fool, you act wisely; if you are wise, you act foolishly.\" \"Let every man,\" says St. James (James 1:19), \"be swift to hear, slow to speak.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrough desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This is a difficult verse, and has obtained various interpretations. The Authorized Version gives, Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom; i.e. a man who has an earnest desire for self-improvement will hold himself aloof from worldly entanglements, and, occupying himself wholly in this pursuit, will become conversant with all wisdom. This gives good sense, and offers a contrast to the fool in ver. 2, who \"hath no delight in understanding.\" But the Hebrew does not rightly bear this interpretation. Its conciseness occasions ambiguity. Literally, For his desire a man who separates himself seeks; in (or against) all wisdom he mingles himself. There is a doubt whether the life of isolation is praised or censured in this verse. Aben Ezra and others of Pharisaic tendencies adopt the former alternative, and explain pretty much as the Authorized Version, thus: \"He who out of love of wisdom divorces himself from home, country, or secular pursuits, such a man will mix with the wise and prudent, and be conversant with such.\" But the maxim seems rather to blame this separation, though here, again, there is a variety of interpretation. Delitzsch, Ewald, and others translate, \"He that dwelleth apart seeketh pleasure, against all sound wisdom he showeth his teeth\" (comp. Proverbs 17:14). Nowack, after Bertheau, renders, \"He who separates himself goes after his own desire; with all that is useful he falls into a rage.\" Thus the maxim is directed against the conceited, self-willed man, who sets himself against public opinion, delights in differing from received customs, takes no counsel from others, thinks nothing of public interests, but in his mean isolation attends only to his own private ends and fancies (comp. Hebrews 10:25). The Septuagint and Vulgate (followed by Hitzig) read in the first clause, for taavah, \"desire,\" taanah, \"occasion;\" thus: \"He who wishes to separate from a friend seeks occasions; but at all time he will be worthy of censure.\" The word translated \"wisdom\" (tushiyah) also means \"substance,\" \"existence;\" hence the rendering, \"at all time,\" omni existentia, equivalent to omni tempore.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A fool hath no delight in understanding. This may mean that he takes no pleasure in the wisdom of others, is self-opinionated; or, it may be, does not care for understanding in itself, apart from the use which he can make of it. Vulgate, \"The fool receives not the words of wisdom;\" Septuagint, \"A man of no sense has no need of wisdom.\" To try to teach a fool is to cast pearls before swine, and to give that which is holy unto dogs. But that his heart may discover itself; i.e. his only delight is in revealing his heart, displaying his un-wisdom and his foolish thoughts, as in Proverbs 12:28; Proverbs 13:16; Proverbs 15:2. He thinks that thus he is showing himself superior to others, and benefiting the world at large. The LXX. gives the reason, \"For rather by folly he is led.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt. The contempt here spoken of is not that with which the sinner is regarded, but that which he himself learns to feel for all that is pure and good and lovely (Psalm 31:18). As the LXX. interprets, \"When the wicked cometh into the depth of evil, he despiseth,\" he turns a despiser. So the Vulgate. Going forward in evil, adding sin to sin, he end by casting all shame aside, deriding the Law Divine and human, and saying in his heart, \"There is no God.\" St. Gregory, \"As he who is plunged into a well is confined to the bottom of it; so would the mind fall in, and remain, as it were, at the bottom, if, after having once fallen, it were to confine itself within any measure of sin. But when it cannot be contented with the sin into which it has fallen, while it is daily plunging into worse offences, it finds, as it were, no bottom to the well into which it has fallen, on which to rest. For there would be a bottom to the well, if there were any bounds to his sin. Whence it is well said, 'When a sinner hath come into the lowest depth of sins, he contemneth.' For he puts by returning, because he has no hope that he can be forgiven. But when he sins still more through despair, he withdraws, as it were, the bottom from the well, so as to find therein no resting place\" ('Moral.,' 26:69, Oxford transl.). Even the heathen could see this terrible consequence. Thus Juvenal is quoted ('Sat.,' 13:240, etc.) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nam quisNEWLINEPeccandi finem posuit sibi? quando receiptNEWLINEEjectum semel attrita de fronte ruborem?NEWLINEQuisnam hominum est, quem tu contentum videris unoNEWLINEFlagitio?\" And with ignominy cometh reproach. Here again it is not the reproach suffered by the sinner that is meant (as in Proverbs 11:2), but the abuse which he heaps on others who strive to impede him in his evil courses. All that he says or does brings disgrace, and he is always ready to revue any who are better than himself. Both the Septuagint and the Vulgate make the wicked man the victim instead of the actor, thus: \"but upon him there cometh disgrace and reproach.\" The Hebrew does not well admit this interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters. \"Man\" (ish) here means the ideal man in all his wisdom and integrity, just as in Proverbs 18:22 the ideal wife is intended under the general term \"wife.\" Such a man's words are as deep waters which cannot be fathomed or exhausted. The metaphor is common (see Proverbs 20:5; Ecclesiastes 7:24; Ecclus. 21:13). For \"mouth,\" the Septuagint reads \"heart:\" \"Deep water is a word in a man's heart.\" The second hemistich explains the first: The well spring of wisdom as a flowing (gushing) brook. A man's words are now called a well spring of wisdom, gushing forth from its source, the wise and understanding heart, pure, fresh, and inexhaustible. Septuagint, \"And it leapeth forth (ἀναπηδύει) a river and a fountain of life.\" Or we may, with Delitzsch, take the whole as one idea, and consider that a man's words are deep waters, a bubbling brook, and a fountain of wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - It is not good to accept the person of the wicked. To \"accept the person\" is to show partiality, to be guided in judgment, not by the facts of a case, or the abstract principles of right or wrong, but by extraneous considerations, as a man's appearance, manners, fortune, family. (For the expression, comp. Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 1:17; and in our book, Proverbs 24:23; Proverbs 28:21.) The Septuagint phrase is θαυμάσαι πρόσωπον, which St. Jude adopts (ver. 16). Other writers in the New Testament use λαμβάνειν πρόσωτον in the same sense; e.g. Luke 20:21; Galatians 2:6). To overthrow (turn aside) the righteous in judgment is not good (comp. Isaiah 10:2). The construction is the same as in Proverbs 17:26. The LXX. adds in the second clause, οὐδὲ ὄσιον, which makes the sentence clear; not seeing this, the Vulgate renders, ut declines a veritate judicii. The offence censured is the perversion of justice in giving sentence against a righteous man whose cause the judge has reason to know is just.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A fool's lips enter into contention; literally, come with quarrel (comp. Psalm 66:13); i.e. they lead him into strife and quarrels; miscent se rixis, Vulgate; \"lead him into evils,\" Septuagint. The foolish man meddles with disputes in which he is not concerned, and by his silly interference not only exposes himself to reprisals, but also exacerbates the original difficulty. His mouth calleth for strokes. His words provoke severe punishment, \"stripes for his back,\" as it is said in Proverbs 19:29. Septuagint, \"His mouth which is audacious calls for death.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The results of the fool's disposition and actions are further noted. A fool's mouth is his destruction (comp. Proverbs 10:15; Proverbs 13:9; Ecclesiastes 10:12). A mediaeval adage pronounces, \"Ex lingua stulta veniunt incommoda multa.\" His lips are the snare of his soul; bring his life into danger (see on Proverbs 12:13; comp. Proverbs 13:14; Proverbs 14:27; Proverbs 17:28). So St. Luke (Luke 21:35) speaks of the last day, coming upon men like \"a snare (παγίς),\" the word used by the Septuagint in this passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The words of a tale bearer are as wounds. Nergan, \"tale bearer,\" is better rendered \"whisperer\" (see on Proverbs 16:28). The Authorized Version reminds one of the mediaeval jingle -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Lingua susurronisNEWLINEEst pejor felle draconis.\" The verse recurs in Proverbs 26:22; but the word rendered \"wounds\" (mitlahamim) is to be differently explained. It is probably the hithp. participle of laham,\" to swallow,\" and seems to mean \"dainty morsels,\" such as one eagerly swallows. Thus Gesenius, Schultens, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others. So the clause means, \"A whisperer's words are received with avidity; calumny, slander, and evil stories find eager listeners.\" The same metaphor is found in Proverbs 19:28; Job 34:7. There may, at the same time, be involved the idea that these dainty morsels are of poisonous character. Vulgate, Verba bilinguis, quasi simplicia, \"The words of a man of double tongue seem to be simple,\" which contains another truth. They go down into the innermost parts of the belly (Proverbs 20:27, 30). The hearers take in the slanders and treasure them up in memory, to be used as occasion shall offer. The LXX. omits this verse, and in its place introduces a paragraph founded partly on the next verse and partly on Proverbs 19:15. The Vulgate also inserts the interpolation, \"Fear overthrows the sluggish; and the souls of the effeminate (ἀνδρογύνων) shall hunger.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He also that is slothful (slack) in his work. A man that does his work in some sort, but not heartily and diligently, as one who knows that labour is not only a duty and necessity, but a means of sanctification, a training for a higher life. Is brother to him that is a great waster; a destroyer. \"Brother\" is used as \"companion\" in Proverbs 28:24 (comp. Job 30:29), for one of like attributes and tendencies; as we say, \"next door to;\" and the destroyer is, as Nowack says, not merely one who wastes his property by reckless expenditure, but one who delights in such destruction, finds a morbid pleasure in haves and ruin. So the maxim asserts that remissness in duty is as mischievous as actual destructiveness. \"An idle brain,\" say the Italians, \"is the devil's workshop.\" The word rendered \"great\" is baal (Proverbs 1:19), \"owner,\" patrono (Montanus), domino (Vatablus); and, taking this sense, according to Wordsworth and others, the sentence implies that the servant who is slothful is brother to a master who is a prodigal. But the interpretation given above is best founded. The LXX., reading מתרפא instead of, מתרפה, renders, \"He who healeth not (ὁ μὴ ἰώμενος) himself in his works is brother to him who destroyeth himself.\" Maxims concerning laziness are found in other places; e.g. Proverbs 10:4; Proverbs 12:11, 24; Proverbs 23:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Name of the Lord is a strong tower. The Name of the Lord signifies all that God is in himself - his attributes, his love, mercy, power, knowledge; which allow man to regard him as a sure Refuge. \"Thou hast been a Shelter for me,\" says the psalmist (Psalm 61:3), \"and a strong Tower from the enemy.\" The words bring before us a picture of a capitol, or central fortress, in which, at times of danger, the surrounding population could take refuge. Into this Name we Christians are baptized; and trusting in it, and doing the duties to which our profession calls, with faith and prayer, we are safe in the storms of life and the attacks of spiritual enemies. The righteous runneth into it (the tower), and is safe; literally, is set on high; exaltabitur, Vulgate; he reaches a position where he in set above the trouble or the danger that besets him. Thus St. Peter, speaking of Christ, exclaims (Acts 4:12), \"Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" \"Prayer,\" says Tertullian ('De Orat.,' 29), \"is the wall of faith, our arms and weapons against man who is always watching us. Therefore let us never go unarmed, night or day. Under the arms of prayer let us guard the standard of our Leader; let us wait for the angel's trumpet, praying.\" Septuagint, \"From the greatness of his might is the Name of the Lord; and running unto it the righteous are exalted.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In contrast with the Divine tower of safety in the preceding verse is here brought forward the earthly refuge of the worldly man. The rich man's wealth is his strong city. The clause is repeated from Proverbs 10:15, but with quite a different conclusion. And as an high wall in his own conceit. The rich man imagines his wealth to be, as it were, an unassailable defence, to preserve him safe amid all the storms of life. בְּמַשְׂכִּתו (bemaskitho), rendered \"in his own conceit,\" is, as Venetian has, ἐν φαντασίᾳ αὐτοῦ, \"in his imagination,\" maskith being \"an image or picture,\" as in Leviticus 26:1; Ezekiel 8:12; but see on Proverbs 25:11. Aben Ezra brings out the opposition between the secure and stable trust of the righteous in the Lord's protection, and the confidence of the rich worldling in his possessions, which is only imaginary and delusive. Vulgate, Et quasi murus validus circumdans eum, \"Like a strong wall surrounding him;\" Septuagint, \"And its glory (δόξα) greatly overshadows him;\" i.e. the pomp and splendour of his wealth are his protection, or merely paint him like a picture, having no real substance. The commentators explain the word ἐπισκιάζει in both senses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - (Comp. Proverbs 16:18; Proverbs 15:33; where the maxims are found in almost the same words.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He that answereth a matter, etc. Thus Ecclus. 11:8, \"Answer not before thou hast heard the, cause; neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk.\" A reminiscence of the passage occurs in the Talmud ('Aboth.' 5. 10), \"I weighed all things in the balance, and found nothing lighter than meal; lighter than meal is the betrothed man who dwells in the house of his intended father-in-law; lighter than he is a guest who introduces a friend; and lighter than he is the man who answers before he has heard the other's speech\" (Dukes, p. 72, § 21). So Menander -NEWLINENEWLINEὉ προκαταγιγνώσκων δὲ πρὶν ἀκοῦσαι σαφῶςNEWLINEΑὐτὸς πονηρός ἐστι πιστεύσας κακῶς. Seneca, 'Medea,' 199 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Qui statuit aliquid, parte inaudita altera,NEWLINEAEquum licet statuerit, haud aequus erit.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity. That high property or faculty of man called \"spirit\" enables the body to bear up against trouble and sickness (comp. Proverbs 17:22). The influence of the mind over the body, in a general sense, is here expressed. But taking \"spirit\" in the highest sense, in the trichotomy of human nature, we see an intimation that the grace of God, the supernatural infusion of his presence, is that which strengthens the man and makes him able to endure with patience. But a wounded (broken) spirit who can bear? The body can, as it were, fall back upon the support of the spirit, when it is distressed and weakened; but when the spirit itself is broken, grieved, wearied, debilitated, it has no resource, no higher faculty to which it can appeal, and it must succumb beneath the pressure. Here is a lesson, too, concerning the treatment of others. We should be more careful not to wound a brother's spirit than we are to refrain from doing a bodily injury; the latter may be healed by medical applications; the former is more severe in its effects, and is often irremediable. In the first clause, רוַּח \"spirit,\" is masculine, in the second it is feminine, intimating by the change of gender that in the former case it is a manly property, virile moral quality, in the latter it has become weakened and depressed through affliction. Septuagint, \"A prudent servant soothes a man's wrath; but a man of faint heart (ὀλιγόψυχον) who will endure?\" The LXX. take \"spirit\" in the sense of anger, and \"infirmity\" as standing for a servant, though whore they find \"prudent\" is difficult to say. Vulgate, Spiritum vero ad irascendum facilem, quis poterit sustinere? The Latin interpreter takes one form of weakness of spirit, viz. irascibility, as his interpretation of נכאה, \"wounded.\" St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:78) has yet another version, \"Who can dwell with a man whose spirit is ready to wrath?\" adding, \"For he that does not regulate his feelings by the reason that is proper to man, must needs live alone like a beast.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The first clause is similar to Proverbs 15:14; the second gives a kind of explanation of the former - the understanding of the wise man is always expanding and increasing its stores, because his ear is open to instruction, and his ability grows by wholesome exercise (comp. Proverbs 1:5). Daath, \"knowledge,\" which is used in both clauses, the LXX. translates by two words, αἴσθησιν and ἔννοιαν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A man's gift maketh room for him (comp. Proverbs 19:6). Mattam, \"gift,\" has been taken in different senses. Some consider it to mean a bribe offered for underhand or fraudulent purposes; but the context does not lead to this conclusion, and the parallel passage mentioned above makes against it. Hitzig sees in it a spiritual gift, equivalent to χάρισμα; but such a meaning is not elsewhere attached to the word. The term here signifies the present which duty or friendship offers to one whom one wishes to please. This paves a man's way to a great person's presence. Bringeth him before great men. The Oriental custom of offering suitable gifts to one in authority, when a favour or an audience is desired, is here alluded to (comp. 1 Samuel 10:27; 1 Kings 4:21; 1 Kings 10:25). So the Magi brought gifts so the newborn King at Bethlehem (Matthew 2:11). In a spiritual sense, the right use of riches opens the way to eternal life, evincing a man's practical love of God and man; as Christ says (Luke 16:9), \"Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles\" (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; Revised Version, he that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just. A man who tells his own story, and is the first to open his case before the judge or a third party, seems tot the moment to have justice on his side. But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out (Proverbs 28:11). The \"neighbour\" is the opposing party - ὁ ἀντίδικος Septuagint, which recalls Matthew 5:25 - he sifts and scrutinizes the statements already given, shows them to be erroneous, or weakens the evidence which appeared to support them. Thus the maxims, \"One story is good till the other is told,\" and \"Audi alteram partem,\" receive confirmation. Vulgate, Justus prior est accusator sui. So Septuagint, \"The righteous is his own accuser in opening the suit (ἐν πρωτολογίᾳ).\" He cuts the ground from under the adversary's feet by at once owning his fault. St. Gregory more than once, in his 'Moralia,' adduces this rendering. Thus on Job 7:11, \"To put the mouth to labour is to employ it in the confession of sin done, but the righteous man doth not refrain his mouth, in that, forestalling the wrath of the searching Judge, he falls wroth upon himself in words of self-confession. Hence it is written, 'The just man is first the accuser of himself'\" (so lib. 22:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18 - The lot causeth contentions to cease (comp. Proverbs 16:33). If this verse is taken in connection with the preceding, it refers to the decision in doubtful cases, where the evidence is conflicting and ordinary investigation fails to elicit the truth satisfactorily. The lot, being considered to show the judgment of God, settled the question. And parteth between the mighty. If it were not for the decision by lot, persons of eminence and power would settle their differences by violent means. This peaceful solution obviates all such contentions. The Septuagint, in place of \"lot\" (κλῆρος), reads now σιγηρός, \"silent;\" but it is evidently originally a clerical error, perpetuated by copyists. The error is noted by a second hand in the margin of the Sinaitic Manuscript.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city. Something must be supplied on which the comparative notion min, \"than,\" depends. So we may understand \"resists more,\" or something similar. A brother or a once close friend, when injured or deceived, becomes a potent and irreconcilable enemy. The idea of the preceding verses is carried on, and the primary thought is still concerning lawsuits and matters brought before a judge. This is shown in the second clause by the use of the word \"contentions\" (midyanim). And their contentions are like the bars of a castle. They close the door against reconciliation, shut the heart against all feeling of tenderness. True it is, Ξαλεποὶ πόλεμοι ἀδελφῶν (Eurip., 'Fragm.'). And again, 'Iph. Aul.,' 376 -NEWLINENEWLINEΔεινὸν κασιγήτοισι γίγνεσθαι λόγουςNEWLINEΜάχας θ ὅταν ποτ ἐμπέσωσιν εἰς ἔριν. Aristotle also writes thus ('De Republ.,' 7:7): \"If men receive no return from those to whom they have shown kindness, they deem themselves, not only defrauded of due gratitude, but actually injured. Whence it is said, 'Bitter are the quarrels of friends;' and, 'Those who love beyond measure also hate beyond measure.'\" An English maxim gloomily decides, \"Friendship once injured is forever lost.\" Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:4), \"Ut adamas, si frangi contingat malleis, in minutissimas dissidit crustas, adeo ut vix oculis cerni queant: ita arctissima necessitudo, si quando contingat dirimi, in summam vertitur simultatem, et ex arctissimis foederibus, si semel rumpantur, maxima nascuntur dissidia.\" Ecclus. 6:9, \"There is a friend, who being turned to enmity will also discover thy disgraceful strife,\" i.e. will disclose the quarrel which according to his representation will redound to thy discredit. The Vulgate and Septuagint have followed a different reading from that of the present Hebrew text: \"Brother aided by brother is like a strong and high city, and he is powerful as a well founded palace,\" Septuagint. The last clause is rendered in the Vulgate. Et judicia quasi vectes urbium; where judicia means \"lawsuits,\" legal disputes; these bar out friendship. The first member of the sentence in the Greek and Latin recalls Ecclesiastes 4:9, etc., \"Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour,\" etc. St. Chrysostom, commenting on Ephesians 4:3 ('Hom.,' 9.), writes, \"A glorious bond is this; with this bond let us bind ourselves together alike to one another and to God. This is a bond that bruises not, nor cramps the hands it binds, but it leaves them free, and gives them ample play and greater energy than those which are at liberty. The strong, if he be bound to the weak, will support him, and not suffer him to perish; and if again he be tied to the indolent, he will rather rouse and animate. 'Brother helped by brother,' it is said, 'is as a strong city.' This chain no distance of place can interrupt, neither heaven, nor earth, nor death, nor anything else, but it is more powerful and stronger than all things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - With the first clause, comp, Proverbs 12:14, and with the second, Proverbs 13:2. A man's belly; i.e. himself, his mind and body, equivalent to shall he be filled, or satisfied, in the second clause. A man must accept the consequences of his words, good or evil. The next verse explains this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeath and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Death and life are in the power of the tongue; literally, in the hand of the tongue. The tongue, according as it is used, deals forth life or death; for speech is the picture of the mind (comp. Proverbs 12:18; Proverbs 26:28). The vast importance of our words may be learned from James 3; and our blessed Lord says expressly (Matthew 12:36, etc.), \"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\" Hence the gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEΓλῶσσα τύχη γλῶσσα δαίμωνNEWLINENEWLINEintimating that the tongue is the real controller of man's destiny; and another -NEWLINENEWLINEΛόγῳ διοικεῖται βροτῶν βίος μόνῳNEWLINENEWLINEBy words alone is life of mortals swayed.\" And they that love it (the tongue) shall eat the fruit thereof. They who use it much must abide the consequences of their words, whether by kind and pure and edifying conversation they contribute health and life to themselves and others, or whether by foul, calumnious, corrupting language they involve themselves and others in mortal sin. For \"they that love it,\" the Septuagint has, οἱ κρατοῦντες αὐτῆς, \"they who get the mastery over it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing. A good wife is meant (as the Septuagint has it, γυναῖκα ἀγαθήν; mulierem bonam, Vulgate), a virtuous, prudent helpmate, as in Proverbs 12:4; Proverbs 19:14; and 31. The epithet is omitted, because the moralist is thinking of the ideal wife, the one whoso union is blessed, who alone deserves the holy name of wife. Thus in ver. 4 we had the ideal man spoken cf. Septuagint, εϋρε χάριτας,\" findeth graces,\" viz. peace, union, plenty, ruder (see a different view, Ecclesiastes 7:26-28). And obtaineth favour of the Lord (Proverbs 8:35; Proverbs 12:2); or, hath obtained (Proverbs 3:13), as shown by the consort whom God has given him. Ratson, \"good will,\" \"favour,\" is rendered by the Septuagint ἱλαρότητα, and by the Vulgate, jucunditatem, \"cheerfulness,\" \"joyousness\" (see on Proverbs 19:12). Ecclus. 26:1, etc., \"Blessed is the man that hath a good wife, for the number of his days shall be double. A virtuous (ἀνδρεία) woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. A good wife is a good portion which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.\" \"A good wife,\" says the Talmud. \"is a good gift; she shall be given to a man that feareth God.\" And again, \"God did not make woman from man's head, that she should not rule over him; nor from his feet, that she should not be his slave; but from his side, that she should be near his heart\" (Dukes, p. 69). A Greek gnome runs -NEWLINENEWLINEΓυνή δικαζα τοῦ βίου σωτηρία The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a paragraph which is not in the Hebrew, and only partly in the Syriac. It seems to be a further explanation of the statement in the text, founded on the practice prevalent at the time when the Septuagint Version was composed, which appears to have made divorce a recognized necessity in the case of adultery: \"He who casteth away a good a wife casteth away good things; but he who retaineth an adulteress is a fool and impious.\" The advice of Siracides concerning a wicked wife is austere: \"If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh\" (Ecclus. 25:26). Nothing is here said about the marriage of divorced persons; but the absolute indissolubility of the marriage bond was never held among the Jews, a certain laxity being allowed because of the hardness of their heart (Matthew 5:32; Matthew 19:8, etc.). The original intently of the marriage contract was re-established by Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - This and the following verse, and the first two verses of the next chapter, are not found in the chief manuscripts of the Septuagint, though in later codices they have been supplied from the version of Theodotion. The Codex Venetus Marcianus (23, Holmes and Parsons) is the only uncial that contains them. The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. The irony of the passage is more strongly expressed by Siracides: \"The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal: the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also\" (Ecclus. 13:3). The rich man not only does wrong, but accompanies the injury with passionate language and abuse, as if he were the sufferer; while the poor man has humbly to ask pardon, as if he were in the wrong. Thus the Roman satirist writes -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Libertas pauperis haec est:NEWLINEPulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat,NEWLINEUt liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti.\"NEWLINE(Juv., 'Sat.,' 3:299.) Aben Ezra explains the verse as denoting that a poor man making a submissive request from a rich man is answered cruelly and roughly. The hardening effect of wealth is seen in our Lord's parables of Dives and Lazarus (Luke 16), and the Pharisee and the publican (Luke 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A man that hath friends must show himself friendly. The Authorized Version is certainly not correct. The Hebrew is literally, a man of friends will come to destruction. The word הִתְרועֵעַ (hithroea) is the hithp, infinitive of רעע, \"to break or destroy\" (comp. Isaiah 24:19); and the maxim means that the man of many friends, who lays himself out to make friends of bad and good alike, does so to his own ruin. They will feed upon him, and exhaust his resources, but will not stand by him in the day of calamity, nay, rather will give a helping hand to his downfall. It is not the number of so called friends that is really useful and precious. But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (Proverbs 17:17; Proverbs 27:10).NEWLINENEWLINEΝόμιζ ἀδελφοὺς τοὺς ἀληθινοὺς φίλους.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Thy true friends hold as very brethren.\" The Vulgate has, Vir amabilis ad societatem magis amicus erit quam frater, \"A man amiable in intercourse will be more of a friend than even a brother.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Better is the poor that walkth in his integrity. The word for \"poor\" is, here and in vers. 7, 22, rash, which signifies \"poor\" in opposition to \"rich.\" In the present reading of the second clause, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, there seems to be a failure in antithesis, unless we can understand the fool as a rich fool. This, the repetition of the maxim in Proverbs 28:6 (\"Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich\"), would lead one to admit. The Vulgate accordingly has, Quam dives torquem labia sua, et insipiens, \"Than a rich man who is of perverse lips and a fool.\" With this the Syriac partly agrees. So that, if we take this reading, the moralist says that the poor man who lives a guileless, innocent life, content with his lot, and using no wrong means to improve his fortunes, is happier and better than the rich man who is hypocritical in his words and deceives others, and has won his wealth by such means, thus proving himself to be a fool, a morally bad man. But if we content ourselves with the Hebrew text, we must find the antithesis in the simple, pious, poor man, contrasted with the arrogant rich man, who sneers at his poor neighbour as an inferior creature. The writer would seem to insinuate that there is a natural connection between poverty and integrity of life on the one hand, and wealth and folly on the other. He would assent to the sweeping assertion, Omnis dives ant iniquus aut iniqui heres, \"Every rich man is either a rascal or a rascal's heir.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good. \"Also\" (gam), Wordsworth would render \"even,\" \"even the soul, i.e. life itself, without knowledge is not a blessing;\" it is βίπς οὐ βιωτός. At first sight it looks as if some verse, to which this one was appended, had fallen out; but there is no trace in the versions of any such loss. We have had a verse beginning in the same manner (Proverbs 17:26), and here it seems to emphasize what follows - folly is bad, so is ignorance, when the soul lacks knowledge, i.e. when a man does not know what to do, how to act in the circumstances of his life, has in fact no practical wisdom. Other things \"not good\" are named in Proverbs 18:5; Proverbs 20:23; Proverbs 24:23. And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth; misseth his way. Delitzsch confines the meaning of this hemistich to the undisciplined pursuit of knowledge: \"He who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray,\" because he is neither intellectually nor morally clear as to his path or object. But the gnome is better taken in a more general sense. The ignorant man, who acts hastily without due deliberation, is sure to make grave mistakes, and to come to misfortune. Haste is opposed to knowledge, because the latter involves prudence and circumspection, while the former blunders on hurriedly, not seeing whither actions lead. We all have occasion to note the proverbs, Festina lente; \"More haste, less speed.\" The history of Fabius, who, as Ennius said,NEWLINENEWLINE\"Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,\"NEWLINENEWLINEshows the value of deliberation and caution. The Greeks recognized this -NEWLINENEWLINEΠροπέτεια πολλοῖς ἐστὶν αἰτία κακῶν.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Rash haste is cause of evil unto many.\" Erasmus, in his 'Adagia,' has a long article commenting on Festinatio praepropera. The Arabs say,\" Patience is the key of joy, but haste is the key of sorrow.\" God is patient because he is eternal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The foolishness of man perverteth his way; rather, overturns, turns from the right direction and causes a man to fall (Proverbs 13:6). It is his own folly that leads him to his ruin; but he will not see this, and blames the providence of God. And his heart fretteth against the Lord. Septuagint, \"He accuseth God in his heart\" (comp. Ezekiel 18:25, 29; Ezekiel 33:17, 20). Ecclus 15:11, etc., \"Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I foil away; for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth. Say not thou, He has caused me to err; for he hath no need of the sinful man,\" etc. The latter part of this important passage St. Augustine quotes thus: \"Item apud Salomonem: Deus ab initio constituit hominem et reliquit eum in manu consilii sui: adjecit ei mandata et praecepta; si voles praecepta servare, servabunt te, et in posterum fidem placitam facere. Apposuit tibi aquam et ignem, ad quod vis porrige manum tuam. Ante hominem bonum et malum, vita et mors, paupertas et honestas a Domino Deo sunt\" ('De Per. Just. Hom.,' cap. 19, § 41). And again, \"Manifestum est, quod si ad ignem manum mittit, et malum ac mors ei placet, id votuntas hominis operatur; si autem bonum et vitam diligit, non solum voluntas id agit, sed divinitus adjuvatur\" ('De Gest. Pelag.,' cap. 3, § 7). Homer, 'Od.,' 1:32, etc. -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free,NEWLINECharge all their woes on absolute decree;NEWLINEAll to the dooming gods their guilt translate,NEWLINEAnd follies are miscalled the crimes of fate.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Pope.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Wealth maketh many friends (vers. 6, 7; Proverbs 14:20). A Greek gnome expresses the same truth -NEWLINENEWLINEἘὰν δ ἔχωμεν χρήμαθ ἕξομεν φίλους. The poor is separated from his neighbour. But it is better to make the act of separation emanate from the friend (as the Hebrew allows), and to render, with the Revised Version, The friend of the poor separateth himself from him. The word for \"poor\" is here dal, which means \"feeble,\" \"languid;\" so ver. 17; and the came word (rea), \"friend\" or \"neighbor,\" is used in both clauses. The idea of man's selfishness is carried on in vers. 6 and 7. The Law of Moses had tried to counteract it (Deuteronomy 15:7, etc.), but it was Christianity that introduced the practical realization of the law of love, and the honouring of the poor as members of Christ. Septuagint, \"But the poor is deserted even by his whilom friend.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This verse is repeated below (ver. 9). It comes in awkwardly here, interrupting the connection which subsists between vers. 4 and 6. Its right place is doubtless where it occurs below. The Law not only strictly forbade false witness (Exodus 20:16; Exodus 23:1), but it enacted severe penalties against offenders in this particular (Deuteronomy 19:16, etc.); the lex talionis was to be enforced against them, they were to receive no pity: \"Life shall be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\" He that speaketh lies shall not escape. The Septuagint confines the notion of this clause to false accusers, Ὁ δὲ ἐγκαλῶν ἀδίκως, \"He who maketh an unjust charge shall not escape,\" which renders the two clauses almost synonymous. We make a distinction between the members by seeing in the former a denunciation against a false witness in a suit, and in the second a more sweeping menace against any one, whether accuser, slanderer, sycophant, who by lying injures a neighbour. The History of Susanna is brought forward in confirmation of the well deserved fate of false accusers.NEWLINENEWLINEΨευδὴς διαβολὴ τὸν βίον λυμαίνεται.NEWLINENEWLINE\"A slander is an outrage on man's life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Many will intreat the favour of the prince; Literally, will stroke the face of the prince, of the liberal and powerful man, in expectation of receiving some benefit from him (Proverbs 29:26; Job 11:19). Every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts (see on Proverbs 17:8). The LXX., reading כָל־הְרֵעַ for בָל־הָּרֵעַ, renders, \"Every bad man is a reproach to a man,\" which may mean that a sordid, evil man brings only disgrace on himself; or that, while many truckle to and try to win the interest of a prince, bad courtiers bring on him not glory, but infamy and shame.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - This is one of the few tristichs in the book, and probably contains the mutilated remains of two distichs. The third line, corrected by the Septuagint, which has an addition here, runs into two clauses (Cheyne). All the brethren of the poor do hate him. Even his own brothers, children of the same parents, hate and shun a poor man (Proverbs 14:20). Much more do his friends go far from him. There should be no interrogation. We have the expression (aph-ki) in Proverbs 11:31; Proverbs 15:11, etc. Euripides, 'Medea,' 561 -NEWLINENEWLINEΠένητα φεύγει πᾶς τις ἐκποδὼν φίλοςNEWLINENEWLINE\"Each single friend far from the poor man flies.\" Septuagint. \"Every one who hateth a poor brother will be also far from friendship.\" Then follows an addition not found m the Hebrew, \"Good thought draweth nigh to those who know it, and a prudent man will find it. He who doeth much evil brings malice to perfection (τελεσιουργεῖ κακίαν); and he who rouses words to anger shall not be safe.\" He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him; or, they are gone. He makes a pathetic appeal to his quondam friends, but they hearken not to him. But the sense is rather, \"He pursueth after, craves for, words of kindness or promises of help, and there is naught, or he gets words only and no material aid.\" Wordsworth quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 38:5 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,NEWLINEQua solatus es adlocutione?NEWLINEIrascor tibi. Sic meos amores?\" Vulgate, Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit, \"He who pursues words only shall have naught.\" The Hebrew is literally, \"Seeking words, they are not\" This is according to the Khetib; the Keri, instead of the negation לא, reads לו, which makes the clause signify, \"He who pursues words, they are to him;\" i.e. he gets words and nothing else. Delitzsch and others, supplying the lost member from the Septuagint, read the third line thus: \"He that hath many friends, or the friend of every one, is requited with evil; and he that seeketh (fair) speeches shall not be delivered.\" Cheyne also makes a distich of this line, taking the Septuagint as representing the original reading, \"He that does much evil perfects mischief: He that provokes with words shall not escape.\" That something has fallen out of the Hebrew text is evident; it seems that there are no examples of tristichs in this part of our book, though they are not unknown in the first and third divisions. The Vulgate surmounts the difficulty by connecting this third line with the following verse, which thus is made to form the antithesis, Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit; Qui autem possessor est mentis, diligit animam suam, et custos prudentiae inveniet bona.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul. \"Wisdom\" is, in the Hebrew, leb. \"heart;\" it is a matter, not of intellect only. but of will and affections (see on Proverbs 15:32). Septuagint, ἀγαπᾷ ἑαυτόν, \"loveth himself.\" The contrary, \"hateth his own soul,\" occurs in Proverbs 29:24. By striving to obtain wisdom a man shows that he has regard for the welfare of his soul and body. Hence St. Thomas Aquinas ('Sum. Theol.,' 1:2, qu. 25, art. 7, quoted by Corn. a Lapide) takes occasion to demonstrate that only good men are really lovers of themselves, while evil men are practically self-haters, proving his position by a reference to Arislotle's numeration of the characteristics of friendship, which the former exhibit, and none of which the latter can possess ('Eth. Nic.,' 9:4). He that keepeth understanding shall find good (Proverbs 16:20). A man must not only strive hard and use all available means to get wisdom and prudence, he must guard them like a precious treasure, not lose them for want of care or let them lie useless; and then he will find that they bring with themselves innumerable benefits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A repetition of ver. 5, except that shall perish is substituted for \"shall not escape.\" Septuagint, \"And whosoever shall kindle mischief shall perish by it.\" The Greek translators have rendered the special reference in the original to slanderers and liars by a general term, and introduced the notion of Divine retribution, which is not definitely expressed in the Hebrew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDelight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Delight is not seemly for a fool (comp. Proverbs 17:7; Proverbs 26:1). Taanug, rendered \"delight,\" implies other delicate living, luxury; τρυφή, Septuagint. Such a life is ruin to a fool. who knows not how to use it properly; it confirms him in his foolish, sinful ways. A man needs religion and reason to enable him to bear prosperity advantageously, and these the fool lacks. \"Secundae res,\" remarks Sallust ('Catil.,' 11), \"sapientium animos fatigant,\" \"Even wise men are wearied and harassed by prosperity,\" much more must such good fortune try those who have no practical wisdom to guide and control their enjoyment. Vatablus explains the clause to mean that it is impossible for a fool, a sinner, to enjoy peace of conscience, which alone is true delight. But looking to the next clause, we see that the moralist is thinking primarily of the elevation of a slave to a high position, and his arrogance in consequence thereof. Much less for a servant to have rule over princes. By the unwise favouritism of a potentate, a slave of lowly birth might be raised to eminence and set above the nobles and princes of the land. The writer of Ecclesiastes gives his experience in this matter: \"I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth\" (Ecclesiastes 10:7). The same anomaly is mentioned with censure (Proverbs 30:22 and Ecclus. 11:5). What is the behaviour of unworthy persons thus suddenly raised to high position has formed the subject of many a satire. It is the old story of the \"beggar on horseback.\" A German proverb declares, \"Kein Scheermesser scharfer schiest, als wenn der Bauer zu Herrn wird.\" Claud., 'In Eutrop.,' 181, etc.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Asperius nihil est humili, quum surgit in altum;NEWLINECuncta ferit, dum cuncta timet; desaevit in omnes,NEWLINEUt se posse putent; nec bellua tetrior ullaNEWLINEQuam servi rabies in libera colla furentis.\" As an example of a different disposition, Cornelius a Lapide refers to the history of Agathocles. Tyrant of Syracuse, who rose from the humble occupation of a potter to a position of vast power, and, to remind himself of his lowly origin, used to dine off mean earthenware. Ausonius thus alludes to this humility ('Epigr.,' 8.) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Fama est fictilibus coenasse Agathoclea regem,NEWLINEAtque abacum Samio saepe onerasse luto;NEWLINEFercula gemmatis cum poneret horrida vasis,NEWLINEEt misceret opes pauperiemque simul.NEWLINENEWLINEQuaerenti causam, respondit: Rex ego qui sumNEWLINESicaniae, figulo sum genitore satusNEWLINEFortunam reverenter habe, quicunque repenteNEWLINEDives ab exili progrediere loco.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; maketh him slow to anger. \"A merciful man is long suffering,\" Septuagint; \"The teaching of a man is known by patience,\" Vulgate. (See Proverbs 14:17, 29.) The Greek moralist gives the advice -NEWLINENEWLINEΝίκησον ὀργὴν τῷ λογίζεσθαι καλῶςNEWLINE\"Thine anger quell by reason's timely aid.\" The contrary disposition betokens folly (Proverbs 14:17). It is his glory to pus over a transgression. It is a real triumph and glory for man to forgive and to take no notice of injuries offered him. Thus in his poor way he imitates Almighty God (Micah 7:18, \"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his auger forever, because he delighteth in mercy\"). Here it is discretion or prudence that makes a man patient and forgiving; elsewhere the same effect is attributed to love (Proverbs 10:12; Proverbs 17:9). The Septuagint Version is hard to understand: Τὸ δὲ καύχημα αὐτοῦ ἐπέρχεται παρανόμοις, \"And his glorying cometh on the transgressors;\" but, taken in connection with the former hemistich, it seems to mean that the patient man's endurance of the contradictions of sinners is no reproach or disgrace to him, but redounds to his credit and virtue. \"Vincit qui patitur,\" \"He conquers who endures.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion, which inspires terror, as preluding danger and death. The same idea occurs in Proverbs 20:2 (comp. Amos 3:4, 8). The Assyrian monuments have made us familiar with the lion as a type of royalty; and the famous throne of Solomon was ornamented with figures of lions on each of its six steps (1 Kings 10:19, etc.). Thus St. Paul. alluding to the Roman emperor, says (2 Timothy 4:17), \"I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.\" \"The lion is dead,\" announced Marsyas to Agrippa, on the decease of Tiberius (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:06, 10). The mondist here gives a monition to kings to repress their wrath and not to let it rage uncontrolled, and a warning to subjects not to offend their ruler, lest he tear them to pieces like a savage beast, which an Eastern despot had full power to do. But his favour is as dew upon the grass. In Proverbs 16:15 the king's favour was compared to a cloud of the latter rain; here it is likened to the dew (comp. Psalm 72:6). We hardly understand in England the real bearing of this comparison. \"The secret of the luxuriant fertility of many parts of Palestine,\" says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 1:72, etc.), \"lies in the rich supply of moisture afforded by the seawinds which blow inland each night, and water the face of the whole land. There is no dew, properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dewdrops by the coolness of the night, as in a climate like ours. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard; and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse.... To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands The amount of moisture thus poured on the thirsty vegetation during the night is very great. Dew seemed to the Israelites a mysterious gift of Heaven, as indeed it is. That the skies should be stayed from yielding it was a special sign of Divine wrath, and there could be no more gracious conception of a loving farewell address to his people than where Moses tells them that his speech should distil as the dew. The favour of an Oriental monarch could not be more boneficially conceived than by saying that, while his wrath is like the roaring of a lion, his favour is as the dew upon the grass.\" רצון (ration), \"favour,\" is translated by the Septuagint, τὸ ἱλαρόν, and by the Vulgate, hilaritas, \"cheerfulness\" (as in Proverbs 18:22), which gives the notion of a smiling, serene, benevolent countenance as contrasted with the angry, lowering look of displeased monarch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - With the first clause we may compare Proverbs 10:1; Proverbs 15:20; Proverbs 17:21, 25. Calamity in the Hebrew is in the plural number (contritiones, Pagn.), as if to mark the many and continued sorrows which a bad son brings upon his father, how he causes evil after evil to harass and distress him. The contentions of a wife are a continual dropping (comp. Proverbs 27:15). The flat roofs of Eastern houses, formed of planks loosely joined and covered with a coating of clay or plaster, were always subject to leakage in heavy rains. The irritating altercations and bickering of a cross-grained wife are compared to the continuous drip of water through an imperfectly constructed roof. Tecta jugiter perstillantia, as the Vulgate has it. The Scotch say, \"A leaky house and a scolding wife are two bad companions.\" The two clauses of the verse are coordinate, expressing two facts that render home life miserable and unendurable, viz. the misbehaviour of a son and the ill temper of a wife. The Septuagint, following a different reading, has, \"Nor are offerings from a harlot's hire pure,\" which is an allusion to Deuteronomy 23:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHouse and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - House and riches are an inheritance of (from) fathers. Any man, worthy or not, may inherit property from progenitors; any man may bargain for a wife, or give a dowry to his son to further his matrimonial prospects. But a prudent wife is from the Lord. She is a special gift of God, a proof of his gracious care for his servants (see on Proverbs 18:22). Septuagint, Παρὰ δὲ Κυρίου ἀρμόζεται γυνὴ ἀνδρί, \"It is by the Lord that a man is matched with a woman.\" There is a special providence that watches over wedlock; as we say, \"Marriages are made in heaven.\" But marriages of convenience, marriages made in consideration of worldly means, are a mere earthly arrangement, and claim no particular grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSlothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; \"causes deep sleep to fall upon a man\" (comp. Proverbs 6:9; Proverbs 13:4). The word for \"sleep\" (תַרדֵמָה, tardemah) is that used for the supernatural sleep of Adam when Eve was formed (Genesis 2:21), and implies pro. found insensibility. Aquila and Symmachus render it, ἔκστασιν, \"trance.\" Slothfulness enervates a man, renders him as useless for labour as if he were actually asleep in his bed; it also enfeebles the mind, corrupts the higher faculties, converts a rational being into a witless animal. Otium est vivi hominis sepultura, \"Idleness is a living man's tomb.\" An idle soul shall suffer hunger. We have many gnomes to this effect (see Proverbs 10:4; Proverbs 12:24; Proverbs 20:13; Proverbs 23:21). The LXX. has introduced something of this verse at Proverbs 18:8, and here render, Δειλία κατέχει ἀνδρόγυνον, \"Cowardice holdeth fast the effeminate, and the soul of the idle shall hunger.\" \"Sloth,\" as the proverb says, \"is the mother of poverty.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Keepeth his own soul. Obedience to God's commandments preserves a man's natural and spiritual life (comp. Proverbs 13:13; Proverbs 16:17). So we read in Ecclesiastes 8:5, \"Whoso keepeth the commandment (mitsvah, as here) shall feel no evil thing.\" He that despiseth his ways shall die. He that cares nothing what he does, whether his life pleases God or not, shall perish. Ἀπολεῖται, Septuagint; mortificabitur, Vulgate. The result is understood differently. The Khetib reads, יוּמַת (iumath), \"shall be punished with death\" according to the penalties enacted in the Mosaic Law. The Keri reads, יָמוּת (iamuth), \"shall die,\" as in Proverbs 15:10; and this seems more in agreement with what we find elsewhere in the book, as in Proverbs 10:21; Proverbs 23:13. This insensate carelessness leads to ruin, whether its punishment be undertaken by outraged law. or whether it be left to the Divine retribution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord. English Church people are familiar with this distich, as being one of the sentences of Scripture read at the Offertory. The word for \"poor\" is here dal, \"feeble\" (see on vers. 1 and 4). It is a beautiful thought that by showing mercy and pity we are, as it were, making God our debtor; and the truth is wonderfully advanced by Christ, who pronounces (Matthew 25:40), \"Inasmuch as ye have done it mite one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\" (see on Proverbs 11:24; 28:27). St. Chrysostom ('Hom.,' 15, on 1 Corinthians 5), \"To the more imperfect this is what we may say, Give of what you have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For, saith he, 'He that giveth unto the poor lendeth unto God.' But if you are in a hurry, and wait not for the time of retribution, think of those who lend money to men; for not even these desire to get their interest immediately; but they are anxious that the principal should remain a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided only the repayment be secure, and they have no mistrust of the borrower. Let this be done, then, in the present case also. Leave them with God, that he may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the whole here; for if you recover it all here, how will you receive it back there? And it is on this account that God stores them up there, inasmuch as this present life is full of decay. But he gives even here also; for, 'Seek ye,' saith he, 'the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.' Well, then, let us look towards that kingdom, and not be in a hurry for the repayment of the whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us wait for the fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that kind, but is such as is meet to be given by God. This, then, having collected together in great abundance, so let us depart hence, that we may obtain beth the present and the future blessings\" (Oxford transl.). That which he hath given will he pay him again; Vicissitudinem suam reddet ei, Vulgate, \"According to his gift will he recompense him.\" גִּמוּל (gemul), \"good deed\" (Proverbs 12:14, where it is rendered \"recompense\"). Ecclus. 32(35):10, etc., \"Give unto the Most High according as he hath enriched thee; and as thou hast gotten give with a cheerful eye. For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times as much.\" There are proverbs rife in other lands to the same effect. The Turk says, \"What you give in charity in this world you take with you after death. Do good, and throw it into the sea if the fish does not know it, God does.\" And the Russian, \"Throw bread and salt behind you, you get them before you\" (Lane).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTChasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Chasten thy son while there is hope; or. seeing that there is hope. Being still young and impressionable, and not confirmed in bad habits, he may be reformed by judicious chastisement. The same expression occurs in Job 11:18; Jeremiah 31:16. \"For so he shall be well hoped of\" (εὔελπις), Septuagint (comp. Proverbs 23:13). And let not thy soul spare for his crying. \"It is better,\" says a German apothegm, \"that the child weep than the father.\" But the rendering of the Authorized Version is not well established, and this second clause is intended to inculcate moderation in punishment. Vulgate, Ad interfectionem autem ejus ne ponas animam tuam; Revised Version. Set not thine heart on his destruction. Chastise him duty and sufficiently, but not so heavily as to occasion his death, which a father had no right to do. The Law enjoined the parents who had an incorrigibly bad son to bring him before the judge or the eiders, who alone had the power of life and death, and might in certain cases order the offender to be stoned (Deuteronomy 21:18, etc.). Christianity recommended moderation in punishment (see Ephesians 6:4; Colossians 3:21). Septuagint, \"Be not excited in the mind to despiteful treatment (εἰς ὕβριν);\" i.e. be not led away by passion to unseemly acts or words, but reprove with gentleness, while you are firm and uncompromising in denouncing evil. This is much the same advice as that given by the apostle in the passages just cited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Some connect this verse with the preceding, as though it signified, \"If you are too severe in chastising your son, you will suffer for it.\" But there is no connecting particle in the Hebrew, and the statement seems to be of a general nature. A man of great wrath; literally, rough in anger; Vulgate, impatiens; Septuagint, κακόφρων ἀνήρ. Such a one shall suffer punishment; shall bear the penalty which his want of self-control brings upon him. For if thou deliver him, yet must thou do it again. You cannot save him from the consequences of his intemperance; you may do so once and again, but while his disposition is unchanged, all your efforts will be useless, and the help which you have given him will only make him think that he may continue to indulge his anger with impunity, or, it may be, he will vent his impatience on his deliverer.NEWLINENEWLINEΒλάπτει τὸν ἄνδρα θυμὸς εἰς ὀργὴν πεσών Anger, says an adage, \"is like a ruin, which breaks itself upon what it falls.\" Septuagint, \"If he destroy (ἐὰν δὲ λοιμεύηται), he shall add even his life;\" if by his anger he inflict loss or damage on his neighbour, he shall pay for it in his own person; Vulgate, Et cum rapuerit, aliud apponet. Another interpretation of the passage, but not so suitable, is this: \"If thou seek to save the sufferer (e.g. by soothing the angry man), thou wilt only the more excite him (the wrathful): therefore do not intermeddle in quarrels of other persons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - (Comp. Proverbs 8:10; Proverbs 12:15.) The Septuagint directs the maxim to children, \"Hear, O son, the instruction of thy father.\" That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. Wisdom gathered and digested in youth is seen in the prudence and intelligence of manhood and old age. Job 8:7, \"Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.\" Ecclesiastes 25:6, \"O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour! Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.\" \"Wer nicht horen will,\" say the Germans, \"muss fuhlen,\" \"He that will not hear must feel.\" Among Pythagoras's golden words we read -NEWLINENEWLINEΒουλεύου δὲ πρὸ ἔργου ὅπως μὴ μῶρα τέληται.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Before thou doest aught, deliberate,NEWLINELest folly thee befall.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The immutability of the counsel of God is contrasted with the shifting, fluctuating purposes of man (comp. Proverbs 16:1, 9; Numbers 23:19; Malachi 3:6). Aben Ezra connects this verse with the preceding, as though it gave the reason for the advice contained therein. But it is most natural to take the maxim in a general sense, as above Wisd. 9:14, \"The thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.\" The counsel of the Lord, that shall stand; permanebit, Vulgate; εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα μενε1FC0;ι, \"shall abide forever,\" Septuagint (Psalm 33:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The desire of a man is his kind. nose. The Revised Version rather paraphrases the clause, The desire of a man is the measure of his kindness; i.e. the wish and intention to do good is that which gives its real value to an act. The word for \"kindness\" is chesed, \"mercy;\" and, looking to the context, we see the meaning of the maxim to be that a poor man's desire of aiding a distressed neighbour, even if he is unable to carry out his intention, is taken for the act of mercy. \"The desire of a man\" may signify a man's desirableness, that which makes him to be desired or loved; this is found in his liberality. But the former explanation is most suitable. Septuagint, \"Mercifulness is a gain unto a man,\" which is like ver. 17; Vulgate, Homo indigens misericors est, taking a man's desire as evidenceing his need and poverty, and introducing the idea that the experience of misery conduces to pity, as says Dido (Virgil, 'AEn.,' 1:630) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.\" A poor man is better than a liar. A poor man who gives to one in distress his sympathy and good wishes, even if he can afford no substantial aid, is better than a rich man who promises much and does nothing, or who falsely professes that he is unable to help (comp. Proverbs 3:27, 28). Septuagint, \"A poor righteous man is better than a rich liar.\" A Buddhist maxim says, \"Like a beautiful flower, full of colours, but without scent, are the fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly\" (Max Muller).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The fear of the Lord tendeth to life (Proverbs 14:27). True religion, obedience to God's commandments, was, under a temporal dispensation, rewarded by a long and happy life in this world, an adumbration of the blessedness that awaits the righteous in the world to come. And he that hath it shall abide satisfied. The subject passes from \"the fear\" to its possessor. Perhaps better, and satisfied he shall pass the night, which is the usual sense of לוּן (lun), the verb here translated \"abide\" (so Proverbs 15:31). God will satisfy the good man's hunger, so that he lays him down in peace and takes his rest (comp. Proverbs 10:3). Vulgate, In plenitudine commorabitur, \"He shall dwell in abundance.\" He shall not be visited with evil, according to the, promises (Leviticus 26:6: Deuteronomy 11:15, etc.). Under our present dispensation Christians expect not immunity from care and trouble, but have hope of protection and grace sufficient for the occasion, and conducive to edification and advance in holiness. The LXX. translates thus: \"The fear of the Lord is unto life for a man; but he that is without fear (ὁ δὲ ἄφοβος) shall sojourn in places where knowledge is not seen;\" i.e. shall go from bad to worse, till he ends in society where Divine knowledge is wholly absent, and lives without God in the world. The Greek interpreters read דּע (dea), \"knowledge,\" instead of רע (ra), \"evil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A slothful man hideth him hand in his bosom; Revised Version, the sluggard burieth his hand in the disk. The word tsallachath, translated \"bosom\" here and in the parallel passage, Proverbs 26:15 (where see note), is rightly rendered \"dish\" (2 Kings 21:13). At an Oriental meal the guests sit round a table, on which is placed a dish containing the food, from which every one helps himself with his fingers, knives, spoons, and forks being never used (comp. Ruth 2:14; Matthew 26:23). Sometimes the holt himself helps a guest whom ha wishes to honour (comp. John 13:26). And will not so much as bring it to him mouth again He finds it too great an exertion to feed himself, an hyperbolical way of denoting the gross laziness which recoils from the slightest labour, and will not take the least trouble to win its livelihood. An Arabic proverb says, \"He dies of hunger under the date tree.\" Septuagint, \"He who unjustly hideth his hands in his bosom will not even apply them to his mouth;\" i.e. he who will not work will never feed himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSmite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware; will learn prudence, Revised Verson (comp. Proverbs 21:11; and see note on Proverbs 1:22). The scorner is hardened to all reproof, and is beyond all hope of being reformed by punishment; in his case it is retribution for outraged virtue that is sought in the penalty which he is made to pay. Τιμωρία, not κόλασις - retributive, not corrective punishment. Seeing this, the simple, who is not yet confirmed in evil, and is still open to better influences, may be led to take warning and amend his life. So St. Paul enjoins Timothy, \"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear\" (1 Timothy 5:20). There is the trite adage -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Happy theyNEWLINEWho from their neighbours' perils caution learn.\" Septuagint, \"When a pestilent fellow is chastised, a fool will be cleverer (πανουργότερος) So Vulgate, Pestilente flagellato stultus sapientior erit. Reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand, knowledge. The scorner does not profit by severe punishment, but the intelligent man is improved by censure, and admonition (comp. Proverbs 13:1; Proverbs 15:12).

Verse 26. - He that wasteth his father. The verb shadad, used here and in Proverbs 24:15, may be taken in the sense of \"to spoil,\" \"to deprive of property;\" but it is better to adopt a more general application, and to assign to it the meaning of \"to maltreat,\" whether in person or property. Chaseth away his mother; by his shameless and evil life makes it impossible for her to continue under the same roof with him; or, it may be, so dissipates his parents' means that they are driven from their home.

This version fairly represents the terse original, if musar, \"instruction,\" be taken in a bad sense, like the \"profane and vain babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called,\" censured by St. Paul (1 Timothy 6:20). But as musar is used in a good sense throughout this book, it is better to regard the injunction as warning against listening to wise teaching with no intention of profiting by it: \"Cease to hear instruction in order to err,\" etc.; i.e. if you are only going to continue your evil doings. You will only increase your guilt by knowing the way of righteousness perfectly, while you refuse to walk therein. The Vulgate inserts a negation, \"Cease not to hear doctrine, and be not ignorant of the war, is of knowledge;\" Septuagint, \"A son who fails to keep the instruction of his father will meditate evil sayings.\" Solomon's son Rehoboam greatly needed the admonition contained in this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - An ungodly (worthless) witness scorneth judgment; derides the Law which denounces perjury and compels a witness to speak truth (Exodus 20:16; Leviticus 5:1), and, as is implied he bears false testimony, thus proving himself \"a witness of Belial,\" according to the Hebrew term. Septuagint, \"He who becometh security for a foolish child outrages judgment.\" The mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity; swallows it eagerly as a toothsome morsel (Proverbs 18:8). So we have in Job 15:16,\"A man that drinketh iniquity like water\" (see on Proverbs 26:6). Such a man will lie and slander with the utmost pleasure, living and battening on wickedness. Septuagint, \"The mouth of the impious drinketh judgments (κρίσεις),\" i.e. boldly transgresses the Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs19:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Judgments are prepared for scorners (see on ver. 25). The judgments here are those inflicted by the providence of God, as in Proverbs 3:34. Scorners may deride and affect to scorn the judgments of God and man, but they are warned that retribution awaits them. And stripes for the back of fools; Vulgate, Et mallei percutientes stultorum corporibus (comp. Proverbs 10:13: 26:3). We had the word here rendered \"stripes\" (מַהַלוּמות mahalumoth) in Proverbs 18:6. The certainty of punishment in the case of transgressors is a truth often insisted on even by heathens. Examples will occur to all readers, from the old Greek oracle, Οὐδεὶς ἀνθρώπων ἀδικῶν τίσιν οὐκ ἀποτίσει, to Horace's \"Raro antecedentem scelestum,\" etc. (See on Proverbs 20:30, where, however, the punishment is of human infliction.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The proverbs of Solomon. The word which is here translated \"proverbs\" is the original mishle (מִשְׁלֵי), the construct case of mashal (מָשָׁל), which, again, is derived from the verb mashal (מָשַׁל), signifyingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"to make like,\" \"to assimilate,\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"to have dominion\" (Gesenius).NEWLINENEWLINEThe radical signification of mashal is \"comparison\" or \"similitude,\" and in this sense it is applied generally to the utterances of the wise. In Numbers 23:7, 8 it is used of the prophetic predictions of Balaam; certain didactic psalms, e.g. Psalm 49:5 and Psalm 78:2, are so designated, and in Job (Job 27:1 and Job 29:1) it describes the sententious discourses of wise men. While all these come under the generic term of m'shalim, though few or no comparisons are found in them, we find the term mashal sometimes used of what are proverbs in the sense of popular sayings. Compare \"Therefore it became a proverb (מָשָׁל), Is Saul also among the prophets?\" (1 Samuel 10:12); and see also other instances in Ezekiel 16:4 and Ezekiel 18:2. In this sense it is also found in the collection before us. The predominant idea of the term, however, is that of comparison or similitude, and as such it is better represented by the Greek παραβολή (from παραβάλλω, \"to set or place side by side\"), literally, a placing beside, or comparison, than by παροιμία, \"a byword,\" or \"a trite wayside saying,\" though in the Greek of the synoptic Gospels παροιμία is equivalent to παραβολή. The English word \"proverb\" insufficiently renders the wider scope of meaning conveyed in the Hebrew mashal, and is not quite accurately rendered here, since of proverbs in our ordinary signification of that word there are comparatively few in this collection. The Hebrew word here means \"maxims,\" \"aphorisms,\" \"wise counsels.\" Of Solomon. Most modern commentators (Delitzsch, Zockler, Fuerst, Stuart, Plumptre, etc.), while attributing, in a greater or less degree, the authorship of the book to Solomon, regard the insertion of his name in the title as indicating rather that he is the dominant spirit among those wise men of his age, some of whose sayings are here incorporated with his own. King of Israel, as forming the second hemistich of the verse, goes with \"Solomon,\" and not \"David.\" This is indicated in the Authorized Version by the position of the comma. The Arabic Version omits allusion to David, and reads, \"Proverbia, nempe documenta Salomonis sapientis, qui regnavit super filios Israel.\" The proverbial or parabolic form of teaching was a recognized mode of instruction among the Hebrews, and in the Christian Church is recommended by St. Clement of Alexandria ('Strom.,' lib. 11, init.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - To know wisdom and instruction. In this verse we have a statement of the first general aim or object of the Proverbs. \"To know\" (לָדַעַת, ladaath) is somewhat indefinite in the Authorized Version, and might be more accurately rendered. \"from which men may know\" (De Wette, Noyes); cf. unde scias (Munsterus). The ל which is here prefixed to the infinitive, as in vers. 2, 8, and 6, gives the clause a final character, and thus points out the object which the teaching of the Proverbs has in view. The teaching is viewed from the standpoint of the learner, and hence what is indicated here is not the imparting of knowledge, but the reception or aprrspriation thereof on the part of the laemer. Schultens states that the radical meaning of דָּעַת (daath) is the reception of knowledge into one's self. Wisdom. It will be necessary to go rather fully into this word here on its first appearance in the text. The Hebrew is חָכְמָה (khokhmah). Wisdom is mentioned first, because it is the end to which all knowledge and instruction tend. The fundamental conception of the word is variously represented as eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the \"power of judging,\" derived from צּצּצּ, \"to be wise,\" from the Arabic, \"to judge\" (Oesenlus); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"the fixing of a thing for cognition,\" derived from the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew חָכַם, as before, which signifies \"to fasten\" (Zockler), or \"compactness,\" from the same root as before, \"to be firm, or closed.\" It is also variously definedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as \"insight into that upright dealing which pleases God - a knowledge of the right way which is to be followed before God, and of the wrong one which is to be shunned\" (Zockler);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) as \"piety towards God,\" as in Job 28:28 (Gesenius);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) as \"the knowledge of things in their being and in the reality of their existence\" (Delitzsch), The word is translated in the LXX. by σοφία, and in the Vulgate by sapientia. The Hebrew khokhmah and the Greek σοφία so far agree as philosophical terms in that the end of each is the same, viz. the striving after objective wisdom, the moral fitness of things; but the character of the former differs from that of the latter in being distinctly religious. The beginning and the end of the khokhmah, wisdom, is God (cf. ver. 7). Wisdom, then, is not the merely scientific knowledge, or moral philosophy, but knowledge κατ ἐξοχήν, i.e. religious knowledge or piety towards God; i.e. an appreciation of what God requires of us and what we conversely owe to God. \"Sapientia est de divinis\" (Lyra). Wisdom will, of course, carry with it the notions of knowledge and insight. Instruction. As the preceding word represents wisdom in its intellectual conception, and has rather a theoretical character, so \"instruction,\" Hebrew, מְוּסָר (musar), represents it on its practical side, and as such is its practical complement. The Hebrew musar signifies properly \"chastisement,\" from the root yasar (יָסַר), \"to correct,\" or \"chastise,\" and hence education, moral training; and hence in the LXX. it is rendered by παιδεῖα, which means both the process of education (cf. Plato, 'Repub.,' 376, E.; Arist., 'Pol.,' 8, 3) and its result as learning (Plato, 'Prob.,' 327, D.). The Vulgate has disciplina. In relation to wisdom, it is antecedent to it; i.e. to know wisdom truly we must first become acquainted with instruction, and hence it is a preparatory step to the knowledge of wisdom, though here it is stated rather objectively. The words, \"wisdom and instruction,\" are found in exactly the same collocation in Proverbs 4:13 and Proverbs 23:23. In its strictly disciplinary sense, \"instruction\" occurs in Proverbs 3:11, with which comp. Hebrews 12:5. Holden takes this word as \"moral discipline\" in the highest sense. To perceive the words of understanding; literally, to discern the words of discernment; i.e. \"to comprehend the utterances which proceed from intelligence, and give expression to it\" (Delitzsch). Understanding; Hebrew, vinah (בִינָה), connected with the hiph. (לְהָבִין l'havin), properly \"to distinguish,\" hence \"to discern,\" of the same clause, signifies the capability of discerning the true from the false, good front bad, etc. With this agrees Cornelius a Lapide, who says, \"Unde prudenter discernas inter bonum et malum, licitum et illicitum, utile et noxium, verum et falsum,\" and from which you are enabled to know what to do in any circumstances, and what not to do. The LXX. renders the word by φρόμησις, the Vulgate by prudentia. Φρόνησις, in Plato and Aristotle, is the virtue concerned in the government of men, manage-merit of affairs, and the like (see Plato, 'Sym.,' 209, A.; Arist.,' Eth.,' N. 6, 5 and 8), and means practical wisdom, prudence, or moral wisdom. Van Ess, Allioli, Holden, translate \"prudence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To receive the instruction of wisdom. This verse carries on the statement of the design of the Proverbs. To receive; Hebrew, לְקַחַת (lakakhath), not the same word as \"to know\" (לָדַּעַת), in ver. 2, though regarded as synonymous with it by Delitzsch. Its meaning is well represented by the LXX. δέξασθαι, and the Authorized Version \"to receive.\" The Hebrew, לָקַחַת, is infinitive, and means properly \"to take, or lay hold of,\" hence \"to receive,\" Greek, δέχομαι, No doubt it conveys the idea of intellectual reception (cf. Proverbs 2:1). The instruction of wisdom; Hebrew, מוּסַר הַשְׂכֵּל (musar has'kel); i.e. the discipline or moral training which leads on to reason, intelligence, or wisdom (as Hitzig, Fuerst, Zockler); or discipline full of insight, discernment, or thoughtfulness (as Umbreit, Ewald, Delitzsch). The phrase does not mean the wisdom which instruction imparts. The word musar occurs here in a slightly different sense from its use in ver. 2; there it is objective, here its meaning as a medium for the attainment of wisdom is more distinctly brought out. Wisdom (haskel) is properly \"thoughtfulness\" (so Umbreit. Ewald, Delitzsch, Plumptre). It is strictly the infinitive absolute of שָׂכַל (sakal), \"to entwine or involve,\" and as a substantive it stands for the thinking through of a subject, so \"thoughtfulness.\" The LXX. renders this sentence, δέξασθαί τε στροφὰς, which St. Jerome understands as \"versutias sermonum et solutiones aenigmatum\" (\"the cunning or craftiness of words and the explication of enigmas\"). Justice, and judgment, and equity. These words seem to be the unfolding of the meaning contained in the expression, \"the instruction of wisdom.\" Holden regards the last four words as objective genitives dependent on \"instruction,\" but wrongly. Cornelius a Laplde states that \"justice and judgment and equity\" indicate the same thing in different aspects. \"Justice stands for the thing itself - that which is just; judgment in respect of right reason, which says it is just; and equity in respect of its being agreeable to the Law of God.\" Justice; Hebrew, צֶדֶק (tsedek), from the root צָדַק (tsadak), \"to be right, or straight;\" in a moral sense it means \"rectitude,\" \"right,\" as in Isaiah 15:2 (Gesenius). The underlying idea is that of straightness. Heidenheim, quoted by Delitzsch, maintains that in tsedek the conception of the justum prevails; but the latter enlarges its meaning, and holds that it also has the idea of a mode of thought and action regulated, not by the letter of the Law, but by love, as in Isaiah 41:2; Isaiah 42:6. Plumptre thinks \"righteousness\" would be a better translation of the word, on the ground that the Hebrew includes the ideas of truth and beneficence. Compare with this the LXX. δικαιοσύνη. Zockler also renders \"righteousness,\" i.e. \"that which is in accord with the will and ordinances of God as Supreme Judge.\" In the Authorized Version, in Proverbs 2:9, where we have the same collocation of words, tsedek is translated \"righteousness;\" cf. Proverbs 12:17, \"He who utters truth shows forth righteousness (tsedek).\" Judgment; Hebrew, מְשְׁפָּט (mish'pat), from the root שָׁפַּט (shapat), \"to adjust, judge,\" corresponds with the Hebrew in meaning; it is the delivery of a correct judgment on human actions. Compare the LXX. κρίμα κατευθύνειν. Equity; i.e. rectitude in thought and action (Delitzsch), or integrity (Zockler). This quality expresses upright demeanour or honoumble action on one's own part individually, while \"judgment\" has regard both to our own and the actions of others. The Hebrew, mesharim (מֵשָׁרִים), used only in the plural, is from the root יָשַׁר (yashar), \"to be straight or even,\" and is equal to \"uprightness.\" The plural form is reproduced in the marginal reading \"equities;\" comp. Psalm 17:2, \"Let thine eyes beheld the things that are equal (mesharim).\" The Vulgate reads aequitas and the Syriae rectitudo. The two ideas in judgment and equity appear to be expressed in the LXX. by the phrase. κρίμα κατευθύνειν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - To give subtilty to the simple. In this verse and the following we are introduced to the classes of persons to whom the proverbs will be beneficial The ל with the infinitive, לָתֵת (latheth) shows that in construction this proposition is so ordinate with those in vers. 2 and 3, and not dependent as represented by ἵνα δῷ (LXX.)and iut detur (Vulgate). Subtilty; Hebrew, עַרְמָה (ar'mah), from the root עָרַם, (aram), \"to be crafty or wily,\" properly means \"nakedness\" or \"smoothness;\" hence in a metaphorical sense it expresses \"the capacity for escaping from the wiles of others\" (Umbreit). We have this idea expressed as follows in Proverbs 22:3, \"The prudent man (עָרוּם, arum) foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself.\" In the Arabic Version it is rendered by calliditas, \"shrewdness,\" in a good sense. The Hebrew ar'mah, like the Latin calliditas, also means \"craftiness,\" as appears in the use of the cognate adjective arum in Genesis 3:1, where we read, \"The serpent was more subtle,\" etc. For \"subtilty\" the LXX. has πσνουργία, a Greek word which appears to be employed altogether in a bad sense, as \"trickery,\" \"villainy,\" \"knavery;\" but that scarcely appears to be the meaning of the Hebrew here, since the aim of the Proverbs is ethical and beneficial in the highest degree. The Vulgate astutia, the quality of the astutus, beside the bad sense of craftiness, also boars the good sense of shrewdness, sagacity, and so better represents the Hebrew. \"Subtilty may turn to evil, but it also takes its place among the highest moral gifts\" (Plumptre). The simple; Hebrew, פְתָאִים (ph'thaim), plural of פְתִּי (p'ti) from the root פָתַח (pathakh), \"to be open,\" properly means the open-hearted, i.e. those who are susceptible to external impressions (Zockler), and so easily misled. The word occurs in Proverbs 7:7; Proverbs 8:5; Proverbs 9:6; Proverbs 14:18; and Proverbs 27:12. The LXX. properly renders the word ἄκακοι, \"unknowing of evil.\" The same idea is indirectly expressed in the Vulgate parvuli, \"the very young;\" and the term is paraphrased in the Arabic Version, iis in quibus non est malitia (\"those who are without malice\"). The Hebrew here means \"simple\" in the sense of inexperienced. To the young man knowledge and discretion. The Hebrew naar (נַעַר) is here used representatively for \"youth\" (cf. LXX., παῖς νέος; Vulgate, adolescens) in general, which stands in need of the qualities here mentioned. It advances in idea beyond \"the simple.\" Knowledge; Hebrew, דַּעַת (daath), i.e. experimental knowledge (Delitzsch); insight (Gesenius); knowledge of good and evil (Plumptre). The LXX. has αἴσθησις, which clasically means perception by the senses and also by the mind. Discretion; Hebrew, מְזִמָּה (m'zimmah), properly \"thoughtfulness,\" and hence \"circumspection\" or \"caution\" (Zockler), or \"discernment,\" that which sets a man on his guard and prevents him being duped by others (Plumptre). Αννοια was probably adopted by the LXX. in its primary sense as representing the act of thinking; intellectus (Vulgate), equivalent to \"a discerning\" (see the marginal \"advisement\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A wise man will hear, and will increase learning. The change of construction in the original is reproduced in the Authorized Version, but has been rendered variously. Thus Umbreit and Elster, regarding the verb יִשְׁמַע (yish'ma) as conditional, translate, \"if the wise man hear;\" on the other hand, Delitzsch and Zockler take it as voluntative,\" let the wise man hear,\" ete. The principle here enunciated is again stated in Proverbs 9:9, \"Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser,\" and finds expression under the gospel economy in the words of our Lord, \"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance\" (Matthew 13:12; cf. 25:29; Mark 4:25; Luke 8:18 and Mark 14:26). Learning; Hebrew, לֶקַח (lekakh), in the sense of being transmitted or received (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Dunn). A man of understanding (LXX., ὁ νοήμων; Vulgate, intelligens) is a person of intelligence who lays himself open to be instructed. Wise counsels; Hebrew, תַּחְבֻּלות (takh'buloth). This word is derived from חֹבֶל (khevel), a ship rope, a denominative of חֹבֵל (khovel), and only occurs in the plural. It signifies those maxims of prudence by which a man may direct his course aright through life (cf. regimen, Arabic). The imagery is taken from the management of a vessel, and is reproduced in the LXX. κυβέρνησις, and the Vulgate gubernatio. \"Navigationi vitam comparat\" (Mariana). The word is almost exclusively confined to the Proverbs, and occurs in Proverbs 11:14; Proverbs 12:5; Proverbs 20:18; and Proverbs 24:6, usually in a good sense, though it has the meaning of \"stratagem\" in Proverbs 12:5. In the only other passage where it is found it is used of God's power in turning about the clouds; cf. Job 37:12, \"And it [i.e. the bright cloud] is turned round about by his counsels (בְּתַחְבּוּל תָוּ, b'thakh'bulothau).\" It is the practical correlative of \"learning,\" in the first part of the verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - To understand a proverb. This verse carries on the idea which is stated in ver. 5. The end of the wise and intelligent man's increase in learning and prudence is that he may be thus enabled to understand other proverbs. Schultens, followed by Holden, takes the verb לְהָבִין (l'havin) as a gerund, intelligendo sententias. This rendering does not represent the end, but points to the proverbs, etc., as means by which the wise generally attain to learning and prudence. And the interpretation; Hebrew, מְלִיצָה (m'litsah). It is difficult to determine the exact meaning of this word. By Gesenius it is rendered \"enigma, riddle;\" by Bertheau and Hitzig, \"discourse requiring interpretation:\" by Delitzsch, \"symbol; by Havernick and Keil, \"brilliant and pleasing discourse;\" and by Fuerst, \"figurative and involved discourse.\" By comparing it with the corresponding words, \"dark sayings,\" it may be regarded as designating that which is obscure and involved in meaning; compare σκοτεινὸς λόγος (LXX.). It only occurs here and in Habakkuk 2:6, where it is rendered \"taunting proverb.\" The marginal reading is \"an eloquent speech,\" equivalent to facundia, \"eloquence.\" Vatablus says that the Hebrews understood it as \"mensuram et pondus verbi.\" The words of the wise; i.e. the utterances of the khakhamim (חֲכָמִים). This expression occurs again in Proverbs 22:17, and also in Ecclesiastes 9:19 and Ecclesiastes 12:11. In the latter they are described as \"goads and as nails fastened by the ministers of assemblies\" (i.e. \"authors of compilations,\" as Mendelssohn), because they cannot fail to make an impression on everybody good or bad. The expression, as used in Proverbs 22:17, implies that other than Solomonic proverbs are included in this collection. And their dark sayings; Hebrew, וְחִידֹתָם (v'khidotham). The Hebrew khidah (חִידָה), as m'litsah (מְלִיצָה)# its parallel in the preceding hemistich, designates obscure, involved utterances. It plainly has the sense of \"enigma\" (Fleischer, apud Delitzsch). Compare αἰνίγματα (LXX.), and aenigmata (Vulgate), which latter is followed by the Chaldea Paraphrase and Syriac (see also Psalm 78:2, \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter dark sayings of old\"). Gesenius derives it from the root חוּד (khud), \"to tie knots,\" and hence arrives at its meaning as an involved or twisted sententious expression, an enigma.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7-ch. 9:18. - Part II. INTRODUCTORY SECTION. The first main section of the book begins here and ends at Proverbs 9:18. It consists of a series of fifteen admonitory discourses addressed to youth by the Teacher and Wisdom personified, with the view to exhibit the excellence of wisdom, and generally to illustrate the motto, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,\" or wisdom. It urges strong encouragements to virtue, and equally strong dissuasives from vice, and shows that the attainment of wisdom in its true sense is the aim of all moral effort. Verse 7. - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. This proposition is by some commentators regarded as the motto, symbol, or device of the book (Delitzsch, Umbreit, Zockler, Plumptre). Others, following the Masoretic arrangement of the Hebrew text, consider it as forming part of the superscription (Ewald, Bertheau, Elster, Keil). As a general proposition expressing the essence of the philosophy of the Israelites, and from its relation to the rest of the contents of this book, it seems rightly to occupy a special and individual position. The proposition occurs again in the Proverbs in Proverbs 9:10, and it is met with in similar or slightly modified forms in other books which belong to the same group of sacred writings, that is, those which treat of religious philosophy - the Khokhmah; e.g. Job 28:28; Psalm 111:10; Ecclesiastes 12:13; Ecclus. 1:16, 25. With this maxim we may compare \"The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom\" (Proverbs 15:33). The fear of the Lord (יִרְאַת יְהוָה, yir'ath y'hovah); literally, the fear of Jehovah. The expression describes that reverential attitude or holy fear which man, when his heart is set aright, observes towards God. The original word, יִרְאַת (yir'ath) for \"fear,\" is properly the infinitive of יָרֵא, (yare), \"to fear or reverence,\" and as a substantive means \"reverence or holy fear\" (Gesenius). Servile or abject fear (as Jerome, Beda, Estius) is not to be understood, but filial fear (as Gejerus, Mercerus, Cornelius a Lapide, Cartwright), by which we fear to offend God - that fear of Jehovah which is elsewhere described as \"to hate evil\" (Proverbs 8:13), and in which a predominating element is love. Wardlaw remarks that the \"fear of the Lord\" is in invariable union with love and in invariable proportion to it. We truly fear God just in proportion as we truly love him. The fear of the Lord also carries with it the whole worship of God. It is observable that the word Jehovah (יְהוָה) is used in the Hebrew, and not Elohim (אְלֶהִים), a peculiarity which is invariably marked in the Authorized Version by small capitals. The beginning; Hebrew, רֵאשִׁית (reshith). This word has been understood in three different senses:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) As initium, the beginning; i.e. the initial step or starting point at which every one who wishes to follow true wisdom must begin (Gejerus, Zockler, Plumptre).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) As caput; i.e. the most excellent or principal part, the noblest or best wisdom. This sense is adopted in the marginal reading (comp. also Proverbs 4:7) (Holden, Trapp).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) As the principium (Vulgate); i.e. the origin, or basis, as in Micah 1:12, \"She is the origin, or basis (reshith) of the sin of the daughter of Zion.\" Delitzsch regards the original, reshith, as embracing the two ideas of commencement and origin, in the same way as the Greek ἀρχὴ. Wisdom has its origin in God, and whoever fears him receives it if he prays in faith (cf. James 1:5, sqq.) (Vatablus, Mercerus, Delitzsch). That the first sense, viz. that of beginning, is to be understood here appears from the parallel passage in Proverbs 10:10, where the corresponding word is תְּחִלָּת. (t'killath), \"beginning,\" from the root חָלַל (khalal), \"to begin;\" cf. also the LXX. ἀρχὴ, in this sense, and the initium of the Syriac and Arabic Versions. All previous knowledge to \"the fear of the Lord\" is comparative folly. He who would advance in knowledge must first be imbued with a reverence or holy fear of God. But fools despise wisdom and instruction; or, according to the inverted order of the words in the original, wisdom and instruction fools despise, the association of ideas in the three words, \"knowledge,\" \"wisdom,\" and \"instruction,\" thus being more continuously sustained. This arrangement links on the two latter words with \"the fear of the Lord,\" and so helps towards the elucidation of the sense in which \"fools\" is to be understood Fools; ךאוִילִים (evilim), plural of ךאוִיּל (evil), from the root אָוַל (aval), \"to be perverse,\" here properly designates the incorrigible, as in Proverbs 27:22, and those who are unwilling to know God (Jeremiah 4:22), and hence refuse and despise wisdom and salutary discipline, those \"who set at nought all his counsel, and will none of his reproof.\" The word is opposed to the \"prudent\" (Proverbs 12:16) and to the \"wise\" (Proverbs 10:14). Delitzsch understands it as \"thick, hard, stupid,\" from the root aval, coalescere, incrassari. Schultens uses παχεῖς, equivalent to erassi pro stupidis, to represent the original. Dunn takes it in the same sense as \"gross or dull of understanding.\" Fuerst, adopted by Wordsworth, regards it in the sense of having no moral stamina, from the root meaning \"to be slack, weak, lax, or lazy.\" But none of these explanations seems, in my opinion, to coincide sufficiently with the evil and depraved activity expressed in the verb \"despise,\" which follows, and which describes the conduct of this class. The LXX. renders the word or action by ἀσεβεῖς, equivalent to impii, \"godless,\" \"profane,\" and the Vulgate by stulti. Despise; בָּזוּ (bazu) is perfect, but is properly translated by the present, because the perfect here represents a condition long continued and still existing (Gesenius, § 126); cf. the Latin odi, memini, etc. The LXX. uses the future ἐξουθενήσουσιν, i.e. they will set at nought; the Vulgate, the present (despiciunt). The radical meaning is most probably contemptuous trampling under the feet (Geseuius). Wisdom and instruction (see ver. 2). The latter clause of this verse is antithetical to the former, but the antithesis is obscurely expressed. In the Authorized Version it is marked by the adversative conjunction \"but,\" which, however, is not in the original. The LXX. has a striking interpolation in this verse between the first and second clauses, which is partly taken from Psalm 111:10 (Σύνεσις δέ ἀγαθὴ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτήν εὐσέβεια δὲ εἰς Θεὸν ἀρχὴ αἰσθήσεως, \"And a good understanding have all they that do it: and reverence towards God is the beginning of knowledge\"). Compare the Arabic Version, which has the same interpolation: Et intellectus bonus onmibus facientibus eam. Sana religio in Deum est initium prudentiae.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-19. - 1. First admonitory discourse. Warning against enticements to robbery and bloodshed. Verse 8. - My son, hear the instruction of thy father. The transition in this verse from what may be regarded as filial obedience towards God to filial obedience towards parents is suggestive of the moral Law. The same admonition, in a slightly altered form, occurs again in ch. 6, \"My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother\" (cf. also Proverbs 4:1). My son; בְּנִבי (b'ni) from בֵּן (ben), \"a son.\" The form of address here adopted was that in common use by teachers towards their pupils, and marks that superintending, loving, and fatherly care and interest which the former felt in and towards the latter. It occurs frequently in the introductory section (Proverbs 2:1; Proverbs 3:1, 21; Proverbs 4:10, 20; Proverbs 5:1; Proverbs 6:1; Proverbs 7:1), and reappears again towards the close (Proverbs 23:15, 19, 26; Proverbs 24:13, 21; Proverbs 27:11) in the teacher's address. The mother of Lemuel uses it (Proverbs 31:2) in the strictly parental sense. In other passages of the Old Testament the teacher, on the other hand, is represented as a \"father\" (Judges 17:10 Isaiah 10:12; 2 Kings 2:21). We find the same relation assumed in the New Testament, both by St. Paul (1 Corinthians 4:15; Philemon 1:10; Galatians 4:19) and by St. John (1 John 2:1; 1 John 5:2); but under the economy of the gospel it has a deeper significance than here, as pointing to the \"new birth,\" which, being a later revelation, lies outside the scope of the moral teaching of the Old Testament dispensation. The instruction (מֶוּסַר musar); as carrying with it the sense of disciplinary education (cf. LXX., παιδεία; Vulgate, disciplina; see also ver. 2), and of the correction with which it may be enforced (cf. Proverbs 13:24; Proverbs 22:15; Proverbs 23:13, 14), the writer attributes appropriately to the father, while the milder torah, \"law,\" he uses of the mother (Delitzsch). Father. The nature of the exhortation conveyed in this verse requires that we should understand the terms \"father\" and \"mother\" in their natural sense as designating the parents of the persons addressed, though a symbolical meaning has Been attached to them by the rabbis (see Rabbi Salomon, in loc.), \"father\" being understood as representing God, and \"mother,\" the people. But the terms are more than merely figurative expressions (Stuart). Those who look upon the Proverbs as the address of Solomon to his son Rehoboam naturally take \"father\" as standing for the former. Naamah, in this case must be the mother (1 Kings 14:31). It is almost unnecessary to state that pious parents are presupposed, and that only that instruction and law can be meant which is not inconsistent with the higher and more perfect Law of God (Gejerus, Wardlaw). And forsake not the law of thy mother. Forsake. The radical meaning of הִּטּשׁ (tittosh) is that of \"spreading,\" then of \"scattering\" (Aiken), and so the word comes to mean \"forsake, reject, or neglect.\" The LXX. reads ἀπώσῃ, from ἀποθέω, abjicere, \"to push away, reject.\" Cf. abjicias (Arabic). The Vulgate has dimittas, i.e. \"abandon,\" and the Syriac, obliviscaris, i.e. \"forget.\" The law; תּורַת (torath), construct case of תּורַה (torah), from the root יָרָה (yarah), \"to teach,\" hence here equivalent to \"a law\" in the sense of that which teaches - a precept (doctrina, Jun. et Tremell., Piscat., Castal., Versions). With one exception (Proverbs 8:10), it is the term which always expresses the instruction given by Wisdom (Delitzsch). The law (torah) of the mother is that preceptive teaching which she imparts orally to her son, but torah is also used in a technical sense as lex, νόμος δέσμος, that which is laid down and established, a decretum or institutum, and designates some distinct provision or ordinance, as the law of sacrifice (Leviticus 6:7). In Joshua 1:8 we find it employed to signify the whole body of the Mosaic Law (sepher hatorah). Mother. Not inserted here as a natural expansion of the idea of the figure required by the laws of poetic parallelism (as Zockler), since this weakens the force of the passage. Mothers are mentioned because of their sedulousness in imparting instruction (Bayne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For they (shall be) an ornament of grace unto thy head. The sentiment here expressed is put forward as an inducement to youth to observe obedience towards the instruction of the father and the law of the mother, and the meaning is that, just as in popular opinion ornaments and jewels are supposed to set off the personal form, so obedience towards parents in the ways of virtue embellishes the moral character (Bayne, Cartwright, Holden). An ornament of grace; Hebrew, לִוְיַת הֵן (liv'yath khen); literally, a wreath or garland of grace. We meet with the same expression in Proverbs 4:9, \"She [i.e. wisdom] shall give to thine head an ornament of grace.\" The Hebrew לִוְיה (liv'yah) is derived from the root לָוָה (lavah), \"to wind a roll\" (Delitzsch) or \"to be joined closely with\" (Gesenius), and hence signifies an ornament that is twisted, and so a wreath or garland. Gejerus and Schultens translate the phrase by corolla gratiosa, i.e. \"a crown full of grace,\" and so meaning conferring or producing grace, just as the expression, \"the chastisement of our peace\" (Isaiah 53:5), means the chastisement bringing or procuring our peace. So again a \"precious stone,\" in Proverbs 17:8, margin, \"a stone of grace,\" is one conferring gracefulness. The marginal reading, \"an adding\" (additamentum, Vatablus), conveys, though obscurely, the same idea; and this sense is again reproduced in the Vulgate, ut addatur gratia capiti suo (\"in order that grace may be added to thy head\"). The LXX. reads, στέφανος χαρίτων. And chains about thy neck. Chains; properly, necklaces; עֲנָקִים (anakim), plural of עֲנָק (anak), \"a cellar or necklace;\" the κλοιός χρύσεος, or \"golden collar,\" of the LXX., and torques (i.e. twisted neckchain) of the Vulgate. There is a very apposite parallel to this verse in Proverbs 6:20, 21 (cf. Proverbs 3:3; see also Judges 8:26). The gold chain round the neck was a mark of distinction, and was conferred on Joseph by Pharaoh when investing him with authority and dignity (Genesis 41:42), and on Daniel by Belshazzar in the same way (Daniel 5:29; see Song of Solomon 4:9). The mere adornment of the person with gold and pearls, without the further adornment of the moral character with Christian graces, is deprecated both by St. Paul and St. Peter (see 1 Timothy 2:9, 10, and 1 Peter 3:3, 4). Neck, גַּרְגְּרֹת (gar'g'roth) only occurs in the plural (Gesenius). (See Proverbs 3:3, 22; Proverbs 6:21.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - My son, if sinners entice thee. (As to the form of address, see ver. 8.) It is here used because the writer is passing to a warning against bad company, and hence the term is emphatic, and intended to call especial attention to what is said. It is repeated again in ver. 15, at a further stage in this address, with the same view. Sinners; חַטָּאִים (khattaim), the plural of חַטָּא (khatta), from the root חָטָּא (khata), properly \"to miss the mark, to err;\" cf. Greek, ἀμαρτάνω, \"to sin\" (Gesenius), here equivalent to \"habitual, abandoned sinners,\" and those especially who make robbery and bloodshed a profession. Not simply peccantes, i.e. sinners as a generic designation of the human race, for \"All have sinned and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23), but peccatores (Chaldee, Syriac, Pagin., Tigur., Versions and Vulgate). \"sinners,\" i.e. those who sin habitually, knowingly, wilfully, and maliciously (Gejerus), or those who give themselves up to iniquity, and persuade others to follow their example (Cartwright). In the New Testament they are styled ἀμαρτωλοὶ. They are those of whom David speaks in strikingly parallel language in Psalm 26:9, \"Gather not my soul with sinners (khattaim), nor my life with bloody men\" (cf. Psalm 1:1). The LXX. has ἄνδρες ἀσεβεῖς (i.e. ungodly, unholy men). Entice thee; 'יְפַתּוּך (y'phattukha); the piel form, פִתָּה (pitah), of the kal פָתָּה (patah), \"to open,\" and hence to make accessible to persuasion, akin to the Greek πειθεῖν, \"to persuade.\" The noun פְּתִי (p'thi), is \"one easily enticed or persuaded\" (Gesenius). The LXX. reads μὴ πλανήσωσιν, \"let them not lead thee astray.\" The idea is expressed in the Vulgate by lactaverint; i.e. \"if sinners allure or deceive thee with fair words.\" The Syriac, Montan., Jun. et Tremell., Versions read pellexerint, from pellicio, \"to entice.\" Consent thou not. (אַלאּתֹּבֵא, al-tove א). The Masoretic text here has been emended by Kennicott and De Rossi, who, on the joint authority of fifty-eight manuscripts, maintain that תֹּבֵא (tove א) should be written תּלֺאבֵא (tosves). Others read תָּבלֺא (tavos), i.e. \"thou shalt not go,\" which, though good sense, is incorrect. אַלאּ (al) is the adverb of negation, i.q. μὴ, ne. The Hebrew תֹּבֵא (toves) is derived from אָבָה (avah). \"to agree to, to be willing\" (Gesenius, Delitzsch), the preformative א being omitted, and is accurately rendered by the LXX., μὴ βουληθῇς, and the Vulgate, ne acquiescas. The warning is especially brief and striking. The only answer to all enticements of evil is a decided negative (Plumptre). Compare St. Paul's advice to the Ephesians (Ephesians 5:11, \"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood. The teacher here puts into the mouth of the sinners, for the sake of vivid representation, the first inducement with which they seek to allure youth from the paths of rectitude, viz. privacy and concealment (Cartwright, Wardlaw). Both the verbs אָרַב (arav) and צָפַן, (tzaphan) mean \"to lay in wait\" (Zockler). The radical meaning of arav, from which נֶאֶרְבָה (neer'vah), \"let us lay in wait\" (Authorized Version) is taken, is \"to knot, to weave, to intertwine.\" Verbs of this class are often applied to snares and craftiness (cf. the Greek δόλον ὑδαίνειν, and the Latin insidias nectere, \"to weave plots, or lay snares\"). Generally, arav is equivalent to \"to watch in ambush\" (Gesenius); cf. the Vulgate, insidiemur sanguini; i.e. \"let us lay wait for blood.\" The LXX. paraphrases the expression, κοινώνησον αἵματος, i.e. \"let us share in blood.\" On the other hand, צָפַן (tzaphan), from which נִצְפְנָה (nitz'p'nah), translated in the Authorized Version, \"let us lurk privily,\" is \"to hide or conceal,\" and intrans. \"to hide one's self,\" or ellipt., \"to hide nets, snares\" (Gesenius, Holden). This sense agrees with the Vulgate abscondamus tendiculas; i.e. \"let us conceal snares.\" Delitzsch, however, holds that no word is to be understood with this verb, and traces the radical meaning to that of restraining one's self, watching, lurking. in the sense of speculari, \"to watch for,\" insidiari, \"to lay wait for.\" The two verbs combine what may be termed the apparatus, the arrangement of the plot and their lurking in ambush, by which they will await their victims. For blood (לְדָם, l'dam). The context (see vers. 12 and 16), bearing as it does upon bloodshed accompanying robbery, requires that the Hebrew לְדָם (l'dam) should be understood here, as Fleischer remarks, either elliptically, for \"the blood of men,\" as the Jewish interpreters explain, or synedochically, for the person, with especial reference to his blood being shed, as in Psalm 94:21. Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide. and Gesenius support the latter view (cf. Micah 7:2, \"They all lie in wait for blood,\" i.e. for bloodshed, or murder. דָם (dam) may be also taken for life in the sense that \"the blood is the life\" (Deuteronomy 12:23). Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. The relation of the phrase. \"without cause\" (חִנָּם, khinnam), in this sentence is a matter of lnueh dispute. It may be taken either withNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the verb (as in the Authorized Version, Wordsworth, Luther, Van Ess, Noyes, Zockler, Delitzsch, Hatzig, LXX., Syriac, Rashi, Ralbac), and then \"lurk privily without cause\" is equivalent toNEWLINENEWLINE(a) without having any reason for revenge and enmity (Zockler), i.e. though they have not provoked us, nor done us any injury, yet let us hurt them, in the sense of absque causa (Munsterus, Paganini Version, Piscatoris Version, Mercerus), ἀδικῶς (LXX.), inique (Arabic);NEWLINENEWLINE(b) with impunity, since none will avenge them in the sense of Job 9:12 (this is the view of Lowestein, but it is rejected by Delitzsch); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it may be taken with the adjective \"innocent,\" in which case it means him that is innocent in vain; i.e. the man whose innocence will in vain protect (Zockler, Holden), who gets nothing by it (Plumptre), or, innocent in vain, since God does not vindicate hint (Cornelius a Lapide). On the analogy of 1 Samuel 19:5; 1 Samuel 25:31; Psalm 35:19; Psalm 69:4; Lamentations 3:52, it seems preferable to adopt the first connection, and to take the adverb with the verb. In the whole of the passage there is an evident allusion to an evil prevalent in the age of Solomon, viz. the presence of bands of robbers, or banditti, who disturbed the security and internal peace of the country. In the New Testament the same state of things continued, and is alluded to by our Lord in the parable of the man who fell among thieves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Let us swallow them up alive as the grave. A continuation of ver. 11, expanding the idea of bloodshed ending in murder, and showing the determination of the sinners to proceed to the most violent means to effect their covetous ends. The enticement here put before youth is the courage and boldness of their exploits (Wardlaw). The order of the words in the original is, \"Let us swallow them up, as the grave, living,\" which sufficiently indicates the meaning of the passage. Alive; חַיִּים (khayyim), i.e. \"the living,\" refers to the pronomiual suffix in נִבְלָעֵם (niv'laem), as in the Authorized Version and Zockler (cf. Psalm 55:15; Psalm 124:3). Umbreit and Hitzig are grammatically incorrect in connecting כִּשְׁאול (kish'ol) \"as the grave,\" with \"the living,\" and translating \"like the pit (swallows) that which lives.\" The כִּ (ki) with a substantive, as here in kish'ol, is a preposition, said not a conjunction (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon'). It denotes a kind of resemblance, but does not introduce a coordinate sentence. The allusion is undoubtedly in the teacher's mind to the fate of Korah and his company (Numbers 16:30-33), and as in that case \"the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up\" in the flush of life, so here the robbers say that they will as suddenly and effectively destroy their victims, בָּלַע (dala); from which niv'laem, in a figurative sense, means \"to destroy utterly\" (Geseuius). The change from the singular, \"the innocent\" (לְנָקִי, l'naki), to the plural in \"let us swallow them up,\" is noticeable. Like the pit (כִּשְׁאול kish'ol); literally, like Sheol, or Hades, the great subterranean cavity or world of the dead. The all-devouring and insatiable character of sheol is described in Proverbs 27:20, where the Authorized Version translates \"Hell (sheol) and destruction are never full,\" and again in Proverbs 30:15, where it (sheol, Authorized Version, \"the grave\") is classed with the four things that are never satisfied. Vulgate, infernus; LXX., ᾅδης. And whole, as those that go down into the pit. The parallelism of ideas requires that the word \"whole\" (תְּמִימִים, t'mimim) should be understood of those physically whole (see Mercerus, Delitzsch), and not in a moral sense, as the upright (Luther, Grief, Holden, Plumptre). The word is used in an ethical signification in Proverbs 2:21. Gesenius gives it the meaning of \"safe, secure.\" Those that go down into the pit (יורדֵי בור, yorde vor); i.e. the dead. The phrase also occurs in Psalm 28:1; Psalm 30:4; Psalm 88:4; Psalm 143:7; Isaiah 38:18). The pit (בור, vor); or, the sepulchre, the receptacle of the dead, is here synonymous with sheol. The LXX. substitutes for the latter part of the verse, Καὶ ἄρωμεν αὐτοῦ τὴν μνήμην ἐκ γῆς, \"And let us remove his memory from the earth.\" The robbers, by drawing a comparison between themselves and Hades and the grave, which consign to silence all who are put therein, imply their own security against detection. They will so utterly destroy their victims that none will be left to tell the tale (see Musset, in loc.). This, we know, is a fancied, and at the best only a temporary, security.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - We shall find all precious substance. This verse carries on the proposal of the sinners one step further, and puts forward a third enticement, viz. that of' the profit of crime, or the prospect of immediate riches, before youth to join in crime. A short cut to wealth, and to the acquirement of that which costs others long years of steady application and carefulness, is a strong inducement (Wardlaw). We shall find; נִמְצָא (nim'tza), from מָצָא (matza), properly \"to reach to,\" and \"to find,\" in the sense of \"to come upon;\" cf. Latin invenio. Substance (הון, hon); i.e. substance in the sense of riches. The radical meaning of הוּן (hun), from which it is derived, is the same as in the Arabic word, \"to be light, easy, to be in easy circumstances, and so to be rich\" (Gesenius). In its abstract sense, hon, \"substance,\" means ease, comfort, and concretely riches which bring about that result (see also Fleischer, as quoted by Delitzsch); cf. the LXX. κτῆσις, i.e. collectively, possessions, property. The Piscatoris Version, for \"precious substance,\" reads divitias, \"riches.\" Precious; יָקָר (yakar), properly \" heavy,\" is found with הון (hon), \"substance,\" in Proverbs 12:27 and Proverbs 24:4. The collocation of the ideas of lightness and heavineess in these two words is striking, but we need not necessarily suppose that any oxymoron is intended, as Schnltens. Such combinations occur in other languages, and reside more in the radical meanings of the words than in the mind or intention of the writer or speaker. We shall fill our houses with spoil; i.e. they promise not only finding, but full possession (Gejerus, Muffet). Spoil; שָׁלָל (shalal), from שָׁלַל (shalal), same as the Arabic verb \"to draw,\" and hence \"to strip off' (Gesenius); and equivalent to the Greek σκῦλα (LXX.), the arms stripped off a slain enemy, spoils, and the Latin spolia (Vulgate). Shalal is used generally, as here, for \"prey,\" \"booty\" (Genesis 49:27; Exodus 15:9). Our gains, say the robbers, will not only be valuable, but numerous and plentiful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Cast in thy lot among us. The fourth and last enticement put forward, viz. honourable union and frank and open hearted generosity. It has distinct reference to the preceding verse, and shows how the prospect of immediate wealth is to be realized (see Delitzsch, Wardlaw). Cast in thy lot cannot mean, as Mercerus, \"cast in your inheritance with us, so that we all may use it in common,\" though גּורָל (goral) does mean \"inheritance\" in the sense of that which comes to any one by lot (Judges 1:3) (Gesenius), since that would be no inducement to youth to join the robbers. Goral properly is \"a little stone or pebble,\" κλῆρος, especially such as were used in casting lots, and so equivalent to a \"lot\" here - that with which the distribution was made, as in Leviticus 16:8; Nehemiah 10:34; and the custom of freebooters dividing the spoil by lot is here alluded to (Holden); comp. Psalm 22:18 in illustration of the practice of casting lots, \"They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.\" The sense is, \"you shall equally with the others cast lots for your share of the spoil\" (Zockler, Delitzsch). Let us all have one parse. Purse; כִּיס (kis), the βαλάντιον of the LXX., the marsupium of the Vulgate, is the receptacle in which money is placed for security. In Proverbs 15:11 it is used for the bag in which traders kept their weights, \"the weights of the bag;\" and in Proverbs 23:31 it is translated \"cup,\" the wine cup. It here signifies the common stock, the aggregate of the gains of the robbers contributed to a common fund. The booty captured by each or any is to be thrown into one common stock, to form one purse, to be divided by lot among all the members of the band. On this community of goods among robbers, compare the Hebrew proverb, In localis, in poculis, in ira. Community of goods among the wicked carries with it community in crime, just as the community of goods among the early Christians implied community in good works and in the religious sentiments of the Christian body or Church. The Rabbi Salomon Isacides offers another explanation (which leaves the choice open to youth either to share in the spoil by lot, or to live at the expense of a common fund, as he may prefer): \"Si voles, nobiscum spolia partieris, si etiam magis placebit, sociali communique marsupio nobiscum vives\" - \"If thou wilt, thou shalt share with us the booty; ay, if it like thee more, thou halt live with us on a confederate and common purse\" (see Cornelius a Lapide).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My son, walk not thou in the way with them. The admonitory strain of ver. 10 is again resumed, and in vers. 16-19 the teacher states the reasons which should dissuade youth from listening to the temptations of sinners. My son. The recurrence of these words for the third time in this address marks the affectionate interest, the loving solicitude, in which the admonition is addressed. Walk not thou. Immediate and entire abandonment is counselled. The warning is practically a repetition of ver. 10, and is given again in Proverbs 4:14, \"Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.\" Way; דֶרֶך (derek) means, figuratively, the way of living and acting (Gesenius). \"Mores et consuetudines\" (Bayne); cf. Proverbs 12:15, \"the fool's way;\" 22:25; and Psalm 1:1. The meaning is \"associate not with them, have no dealings whatever with them.\" Refrain thy foot from their path; i.e. keep back thy foot, or make not one step in compliance, resist the very first solicitations to evil. Compare the legal maxim, Initiis obsta. Refrain; מְגַע (m'na) is from מָנַע (mana), \"to keep back, restrain;' LXX., ἔκκινον (cf. Psalm 119:101, \"I have refrained my feet from every evil way;\" Jeremiah 14:10, \"Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet\"). Restraining the foot carries with it indirectly the natural inclination or propensity of the heart, even of the good, towards evil (Cartwright). Foot (רֶגֶל regel) is, of course, used metaphorically, and means less the member of the body than the idea suggested by it; hence the use of the singular (Gejerus, Delitzsch). Bayne remarks that the Hebrews understood this passage as meaning \"neither in public nor private life have any dealings with sinners.\" Path (נָתִיב, nathiv) is a beaten path, a pathway, a byway; from the unused root נָתַב (nathav), \"to tread, trample;\" and hence, while \"way\" may mean the great public high road, \"path\" may stand for the bypath, less frequented or public. The same distinction probably occurs in Psalm 25:4, \"Show me thy ways, O Lord; and teach me thy paths.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. This is the first dissuasive urged to enforce the warning against evil companionship, as showing the extremes to which entering upon the ways of the wicked lead ultimately. At once the youth who listens will be hurried along impetuously to the two crimes of robbery and murder, which God has expressly forbidden in the eighth and sixth commandments respectively of the moral code. Evil (רַע, ra) is \"wickedness,\" τὸ κακόν, generally, but here more specifically highway robbery, latrocinism (Cornelius a Lapide), as appears from vers. 11-13, where also murder, the laying in wait for blood, is proposed. The Rabbis Salomon and Salazar understand the evil to refer to the evil or destruction which sinners bring upon themselves, and the shedding of blood to the fact that they lay themselves open to have their own blond shed by judicial process (see also Holden). The former explanation seems preferable to this, as putting a higher law than that of self-preservation before youth. The fear of judges who can condemn to death is notbing comparatively to the fear of him \"who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.\" This verse is wanting in the Vatican LXX., and Arabic, and hence Hitzig has concluded that it is an interpolation made from Isaiah 59:7, but upon insufficient evidence, as it is found in the Alexandrian LXX., Chaldea Paraphrase, Vulgate, and Syriac Versions, all which follow the Hebrew text. The latter part of the verse is quoted by St. Paul in Romans 3:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Surely in vain the net is spread in the face of any bird. The teacher here advances a second reason in support of his warning in ver. 15, under the form of a proverb in its strict sense. It is based on the ill-advised audacity of sinners in flying in the face of God's judgments. In vain (חִנָּם khinnam), see ver. 11, may be taken in two senses.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) I.e. to no purpose, gratis, frustra (Vulgate, Chaldee Paraphrase, Arabic). The meaning of the proverb here used then is, \"to no purpose is the net spread before birds,\" i.e. though they see the net spread before them, they nevertheless fly into it (romp. Proverbs 7:23, \"As a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life\"). So sinners, when they are plotting for others, plunge into their own destruction with their eyes open. Therefore do not associate with them, do not imitate their crass folly, be warned by their example, or you will share their fate. This view is supported by the LXX. reading, Οὐ γὰρ ἀδίκως ἐκτείνεται δίκτυα πτερωτοῖς, \"For not unreasonably is the net spread before birds;\" i.e. they fall into the snare (see Luther, Patrick, Umbreit, Ewatd, Hitzig, Zockler, Plumptre).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Others, as Delitzsch, Ziegler, Beda, Doderlein, Bertheau, Wardlaw, take khinnam in a different sense, as indicating the escape of the birds - the birds see the snare and fly away, and so in vain the net is spread in their sight. This explanation is in agreement with Ovid's statement, \"Quae nimis apparent retia vitat avis.\" The moral motive put before youth in this case is the aggravation of his guilt if he listens to the enticements of sinners. The teacher seems to say, \"Imitate the birds, flee from temptation; if you listen to sinners, you will sin with your eyes open.\" Is spread; מְזֹרָה (m zorah), expansum, not conspersum est, i.e. besprinkled or strewn with corn as a bait, as Rashi. M'zorah is the participle passive of pual, זֹרָה (zorah), \"to be strewn,\" from kal זָרָה (zarah). \"to scatter, or disperse\" (Gesenius), and means expansum, because when a net is scattered or dispersed it is spread out (see Delitzsch). Of any bird (כָּל־בַּעַל כָּנָפ khal-baal khanaph); literally, of every possessor of a wing, or, as margin, of everthing that hath a wing, i.e. of every bird. Compare the same expression in Ecclesiastes 10:20, בַּעַל חַכְּנָפַיִם (baal hach naphayim); i.e. \"that which hath wings\" (Authorized Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And they lay wait for their own blood, etc. The third reason or argument why the teacher's warning should be followed, drawn from the destruction which overtakes the sinners themselves. \"Lay wait,\" and \"lurk privily,\" as in ver. 11, from which this verse is evidently borrowed. They propose, as they say, to lay wait for the blood of others; but it is, says the teacher, for their own blood. לְדָמָם (l'dhammam), contra sanguinem suum; they lurk privily. as they say, for the innocent, but in reality it is for their own lives; לְנַפְשֹׁתָם (l'naph'shotham); contra animus suas (Vulgate); or, as the LXX. puts it, Αὐτοὶ γὰρ οἱ φόνον μετέχοντες θησαυρίζουσιν ἑαυτοῖς κατὰ, \"For they who take part in murder treasure up evils for themselves;\" that is, they am bringing a heavier and surer destruction upon themselves than they can ever inflict upon others (Wardlaw). The LXX. adds, at the close of the verse, Ἡ δὲ καταστροφὴ ἀνδρῶν παρανόμων κακή, \"And the overthrowing or destruction of transgressors is wrest, or evil.\" The Arabic Version has a similar addition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - So am the ways of every one that is greedy of gain. The epiphonema or moral of the preceding address. So are the ways, or such is the lot (as Delitzsch), or such are the paths (as Zockler), i.e. so deceitful, so ruinous, are the ways. כֵּן (chen,) is here used as a qualitative adverb. Ways; אָרְחות (ar'khoth), the plural of לֺארַח (orakh), a poet. word, equivalent in the first instance to \"way,\" i.q. דֶרֶך (derekh), and metaphorically applied to any one's ways, his manner of life and its result, and hence lot, as in Job 8:12, and hence the expression coven the three preceding verses. That is greedy of gain (בֹצֵעַ בָּצַע, botsea batsa); literally, concupiscentis concupiscentium lucri; i.e. eagerly longing after gain; he who greedily desires riches (avari, Vulgate). Gain; batsa in pause, from בֶּצַע. (betsa), which takes its meaning from the verb בָּצַע (batsa), \"to out in pieces, to break,\" and hence means properly that which is cut or broken off and taken by any one for himself, and so unjust gain - anything whatever fraudulently acquired, as in Proverbs 28:16, where it is translated \"covetousness\" (Authorized Version); cf. Isaiah 33:15; Proverbs 15:27. The idea of greed and covetousness enters largely into the word. Which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. The pronoun \"which\" does not occur in the original. The nominative to \"taketh away\" (יִקָּת, yikkath) is \"gain;\" the \"unjust gain.\" (betsa) takes away the life of its owners, i.e. of those who are under its power. Owners thereof (בְּעָלָיו, b'alayo) does not necessarily imply that they are in actual possession of the unjust gain, but rather refers to the influence which the lust for gain exercises over them. The expression in this second hemistich does not mean that the rapacious take the life of their comrades who possess the gain, as Rabbi Salomon; nor as the Vulgate, \"the ways of the avaricious man take away the lives of those who possess them.\" For the phrase, \"taketh away the life,\" as importing a violent taking away, cf. Psalm 31:13; 1 Kings 19:10. The sentiment of the verse is well expressed in 1 Timothy 6:10, \"For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-33. - 2. Second admonitory discourse. Address of Wisdom personified, exhibing the folly of those who wilfully reject, and the security of those who hearken to, her counsels. The sacred writer, in this section, as also in ch. 8, uses the rhetorical figure of prosopopceia, or impersonation. Wisdom is represented as speaking and as addressing the simple, scorners, and fools. The address itself is one of the noblest specimens of sacred eloquence, expressing in rapid succession the strongest phases of feeling - pathetic solicitude with abundant promise, indignant scorn at the rejection of her appeal, the judicial severity of offended majesty upon offenders, and lastly the judicial complacency which delights in mercy towards the obedient. The imagery in part is taken from the forces of nature in their irresistible and overwhelming violence and destructive potency. Verse 20. - Wisdom crieth without. Wisdom. The Hebrew word (khochmoth) here used to designate Wisdom seems to be an abstract derivation from the ordinary khochmah. The form is peculiar to the Proverbs and Psalms, in the former occurring four times (Proverbs 1:22; Proverbs 9:1; Proverbs 14:1; Proverbs 24:7), and in the latter twice only (viz. Psalm 49:4; Psalm 78:15). As in Proverbs 9:1 and Proverbs 24:7, it is a pluralis excellentiae of the feminine gender, a variety of the pluralis extensivus, as Bottcher prefers to denominate it. The feminine form may he determined by the general law which associates purity and serenity with womanhood (Plumptre). The idea of plurality, however, is not that of extension, but of comprehension, i.e. it is not so much all kinds of wisdom which is presented to us, as all the varieties under which wisdom par excellence may be regarded and is comprehended. The plural form of the word denotes the highest character or excellence in which wisdom can be conceived; or, as the marginal reading expresses it, wisdoms, i.e. excellent wisdom. Other instances of the pluralis excellentiae are met with in Holy Writ, e.g. Elohim, God, i.e. \"God of Gods,\" either from the polytheistic view, or from the monotheistic view as expressive of God's might in manifestation, passim; k'doshim, \"the Holy (God),\" Proverbs 9:10; Proverbs 30:3; adonim, for adon \"lord\" (Gesenius, 'Gram.,' § 108. 2 b). In the conception of Wisdom here presented to us in the text we have the germ of an idea which, on the principles of expansion, developed subsequently in the consciousness of the Christian Church into a definite identification of Wisdom with the Second Person of the blessed Trinity. There is a striking parallel to this passage in Luke 11:49, where Christ speaks of himself as ἡ Σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ, \"the Wisdom of God,\" that shall send prophets and apostles into the world, and thereby identifies himself with Wisdom (cf. this with vers. 20, 21; ch. 7.). Again, a striking similarity is observable between the teaching of Divine Wisdom and that of the Incarnate Word, as much in their promises as in their threats and warnings. But it is difficult to determine with accuracy to what extent the Messianic import of the personification was present to the consciousness of the sacred writers, and whether Wisdom as here presented to us is simply a poetic and abstract personification or a distinct by-postatizing of the Word. Dorner ('Pers. of Christ,' Introd., p. 16), with reference to ch. 8:22, etc., says that though Wisdom is introduced speaking as a personality distinct from God, still the passage does not lead clearly to an hypostatizing of the Khochmah. Dollinger ('Heidenthum und Judenthum,' bk. 10. pt. 3. sec. 2 a, and Proverbs 8:22, etc.) maintains that Wisdom is \"the personified idea of the mind of God in creation,\" rather than the presence of \"a distinct hypostasis.\" Lucke (see references in Liddon, 'Bampton Lects.') holds that in Proverbs Wisdom is merely a personification It is clear that whatever is predicated of Wisdom in ch. 8. must be also predicated of her in the passage before us, in reference either to the hypostatic or opposite view. On the other hand, a large number of expositors, dating from the earliest periods of the Christian Church down to the present time, see in Wisdom a distinct hypostasis, or person - the Lord Jesus Christ. A fuller investigation of this subject will be seen in our remarks on ch. 8. For the present we observe that Wisdom is essentially Divine. Her authority, her utterances, whether of promise, threat, scorn, or vengeance, are the authority, the utterances, of God. Crieth; rather, crieth loudly, or aloud. The Hebrew verb ranan (רָנַן) is \"to vibrate the voice,\" and conveys the idea of the clear loud ringing tones with which proclamations were made; cf. the Vulgate praedicare, and the Arabic clamitate, \"to cry with a loud voice.\" Fleischer remarks that the Arabic rannan, which is allied to the Hebrew verb, is used of a speaker who has a clear piercing voice. In such a way does Wisdom cry without when making her address. She elevates her voice that all may hear. The verb in the original is tazonnah, the feminine singular of ranan, and predicate to \"Wisdom,\" according to the rule that verbs in the singular are construed with plural nouns having a singular signification, especially the pluralis excellentiae (see Gesenius, 'Gram.,' § 146. 2). Without. בַּהוּצ (bakhuts) is here used adverbially, as in Genesis 9:22, and signifies \"in the open places,\" i.e. abroad, without, as opposed to the space within the walls. The writer here begins his enumeration of the five places wherein Wisdom preaches, viz.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) without,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) in the streets,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) in chief places of concourse,NEWLINENEWLINE(4) in the opening of the gates,NEWLINENEWLINE(5) in the city, all of which are public, and thus indicate the publicity of her announcements (with those comp. Proverbs 8:1; Proverbs 9:3). She uttereth her voice; or, causeth her voice to be beard; represented in the Vulgate by dat vocem suam. and in the LXX. by παῥῤησίαν ἄγει (equivalent to \"she observes free-spokenness\"). The instrumentality which Wisdom uses in her public preaching are the prophets and teachers (Ecclus. 24:33; Zockler, Vatablus, Mercerus). In the streets; literally, in the wide spares; the Hebrew, רחֹבות (r'khovoth), being, as in Genesis 26:22, \"wide spaces,\" and corresponding to the πλατεία of the LXX.; plateae, Vulgate. The same places are indicated in Luke 14:21, where, in the parable of the marriage supper, the servants are bidden to go out into the streets (πλατείαι) and lanes of the city. The word is connected with the adjective rakhav (רָחַב), \"broad,\" \"wide;\" and in 2 Chronicles 32:6 is used to designate the ample space at the gates of Oriental cities (Gesenius), though here it seems to refer rather to \"squares,\" large open spaces, not uncommon in Oriental cities - I saw one such at Aden - or it may refer to the broad crowded thoroughfares. The Syriac reading, in compitis, gives a different sense, as compitum, equivalent to \"crossroads.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - She crieth in the chief place of concourse. The chief place is literally the head (רלֺאשׁ, rosh); here used figuratively for the place where streets or roads branch off in different directions, as in Ezekiel 16:25, \"the beginning of streets,\" or \"the head of the way;\" comp. Genesis 2:10, where it is used of the point at which the four streams branched off; and the corresponding expression in Proverbs 8:2, \"She staudeth in the top (rosh) of high places.\" Of concourse; הֹמִיּות (homiyyoth) is the plural of the adjective, הומִי (homi): literally, \"those who are making a noise,\" or \"the tumultuous;\" here, as in Isaiah 22:2 and 1 Kings 1:41, used substantively for \"boisterous, noisy places\" (compare the Vulgate, in capite turbaram). The variation in the LXX., \"on high walls,\" or \"on the tops of the walls\" (ἐπ᾿ ἄκρων δὲ τειχέων, super summos muros), which is adopted also in the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic Versions, arises from reading חומות (khomoth), \"walls,\" for the Masoretic homiyyoth. In the openings of the gates. The opening (פֶתַח pethakh) is the opening of the gate, or the entrance by the gate (שַׁעַר, shaar), i.e. of the city, the introitus portae of the Chaldee and Syriac Versions. The openings of the gates would be thronged, as courts of justice were held at the gates (Deuteronomy 16:18; 2 Samuel 15:2); business was carried on there, as the selling and redemption of land (Genesis 23:10-16; Ruth 4:1); markets were also held there (2 Kings 7:1-18); and the same localities were used for the councils of the state and conferences (Genesis 34:20; 2 Samuel 3:27; 2 Chronicles 18:9; Jeremiah 17:19; comp. Proverbs 31:33, \"Her husband is known in the gates\"). In place of the expression, \"in the openings of the gates,\" the LXX. reads, Ἐπὶ δὲ πύλαις δυναστῶν παρεδρεύει, \"And at the gates of the mighty she sits\" - an interpolation which only partially represents the sense of the original, and which is adopted in the Arabic. In the next clause, for \"in the city\" is substituted ἐπὶ δὲ πύλαις πόλεως, \"at the gates of the city.\" The Vulgate combines the separate clauses of the original in one - in foribus portarum urbis, \"in the entrances and openings of the gates of the city.\" In the city (בָעִיר, bair); i.e. in the city itself (so Aben Ezra, ap. Gejerus), as opposed to the entrance by the gates, and so used antithetically (as Umbreit, Bertheau, Hitzig). The publicity of the teaching of Wisdom, observable in the places she selects for that purpose, also marked the public ministry of our Lord and his disciples, and finds an illustration in his command, \"What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops\" (Matthew 10:27); i.e. give it all the publicity possible. The spirit of Wisdom, like that of Christianity, is aggressive (see Wardlaw, 'Lectures on Proverbs 4,' vol. 1. pp. 40, 41).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? etc. From this verse to the end of the chapter the sacred writer puts before us the words of Wisdom herself. The discourse begins in the same way as in Psalm 4:2 (Zockler), and the classification of the persons addressed - the simple, the scorners, and the sinners - closely resembles that of Psalm 1:1. In the order there is a progression from the least to the most culpable. The simple (פְתָיִם, p'thayim), as in ver. 4, those who are indifferent through thoughtlessness and inconsiderateness, and are thereby open to evil. The scorners (לֵצֵים, letsim); or, mockers, the same as the (לָצון, latson) \"scornful men\" of Proverbs 29:8, derived from the root לּוּצ (luts), \"to deride, mock,\" probably by imitating the voice in derision. The mockers are those who hold all things in derision, both human and Divine, who contemn God's admonitions, and treat with ridicule both threatenings and promises alike. Fools; כְסִילִים (ch'silim), a different word from the evilim of ver. 7, but signifying much the same, i.e. the obdurate, the hardened, stolidi, those who walk after the sight of their eyes and the imagination of their hearts - a class not ignorant of knowledge, but hating it because of the restraint it puts them under. The word occurs in Proverbs 17:10, in the sense of the incorrigible; in Proverbs 26:3, 4 as a term of the greatest contempt. The enallage, or interchange of tenses in the original - the verbs \"love\" and \"hate\" being future, and \"delight\" being perfect - is not reproducible in English. The perfect is used interchangeably with the future where the action or state is represented as first coming to pass or in progress, and, as Zockler remarks, may be inchoative, and so be rendered \"become fond of,\" instead of \"be fond of.\" But it appears to represent not so much a state or action first coming to pass as in progress (see Geseuius, 'Gram.,' § 126, 3). Bottcher (§ 948, 2) translates it by concupiverint, i.e. \"How long shall ye have delighted in scorning?\" The futures express \"love\" and \"hate\" as habitual sentiments (Delitzsch). It is to be noted that the language of Wisdom, in vers. 22 and 23, is expressive of the most tender and earnest solicitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Turn you at my reproof. A call is here made to repentance. The meaning seems to be \"return to my reproof,\" i.e. place yourselves under my reproof (as Gejerus, Delitzsch), the לְ Being represented by ad, as in the Vulgate: convertimini ad correptionem meam. It is susceptible, however, of a different reading, i.e. \"in consequence of, or because of (propter), my reproof,\" the prefix לְ being found in Numbers 16:34, \"They fled at the cry,\" i.e. because of the cry. Reproof (תֶוכַחַת thochakhath); i.e. rebuke, or correction, by words. The LXX. ἔλεγχος conveys the argumentative conviction which will be present in the reproof. The word occurs again in vers. 23, 25, and 30 of this chapter, and also in Proverbs 3:11; Proverbs 5:12; Proverbs 6:23; Proverbs 27:5; Proverbs 29:15. Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. The promise consequent upon, and the encouragement to, repentance. The promise is conditioned - if those addressed will heed the reproof of Wisdom, then she will pour forth her Spirit upon them, and cause them to know her words The verb hibbia (הִבִּיעַ), \"to stream forth, or gush out,\" is here used figuratively. The outflow of the Spirit of Wisdom will be like the abundant and continuous gushing forth of water from the spring or fountain. The verb unites in it the figures of abundant fulness and refreshing invigoration (Umbreit, Elster); comp. Proverbs 15:2, 28; Psalm 59:7; Psalm 119:171; Ecclesiastes 10:1. We have here striking anticipation of the prophecy of Joel (Joel 2:28). The Spirit is that of Wisdom \"and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and godly strength, the Spirit of knowledge and true godliness\" (see Confirmation Office). The explanation of Beda, that it signifies her anger, is clearly inadmissible. I will make known my words unto you; i.e. as the LXX., \"I will teach you my word\" (διδάξω), or as the Vulgate \"show\" (ostendam), \"expound, or make clear.\" My words (d'vari); i.e. precepts, or doctrine, or secrets. An intimate relation subsists between the \"Spirit\" of Wisdom and her \"words,\" with which it is parallel. The former is the illuminating, invigorating principle which infuses life and power into the \"words\" of Wisdom, which she has already given, and which are already in our possession. Wisdom stands in the same relation to her words as the Divine Logos does to his utterances, into which he infuses himself. \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:63. See Delitzsch, Wardlaw, in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Because I have called, and ye refused. A pause may be imagined, and seems to be implied, between this and the preceding verses (22 and 23), when the address passes into a new phase - from that of invitation and promise to that of judgment and stern denunciation (vers. 24-27). In the subsection the antecedent clauses are vers. 24, 25, introduced by the conjunction \"because\" (יַעַן, yaan; quia, Vulgate), which expresses the reason or cause for the conclusion in vers. 26 and 27, introduced by \"I also,\" to which the \"because\" answers. A similar grammatical construction and judgment is to be found in Isaiah: \"I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I Spake, they did not hear\" (Isaiah 66:4; see also Jeremiah 7:13). Refused; i.e. refused to hearken, as signified in the LXX. ὑπακούσατε. I have stretched out my hand. A forensic gesture to arrest attention. The expression is equivalent to \"I have spread out my hands\" (Isaiah 65:2); cf. \"Then Paul stretched forth the hand (ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα)\" (Acts 26:1). Regarded (מַקְשִׁיב, mak'shiv). The original idea of the verb קַשַׁב (kashav), used here, is that of erecting or pricking up the ear, like the Latin arrigere, sc. aures, in Plaut., 'Rud.,' 5, 2, 6; and cf. \"arrectisque auribus adstant\" (Virgil, 'AEneid,' 1:153).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Ye have set at nought; rather, rejected (Umbreit, Ewald, et alii). The Authorized Version rendering here is equivocal, inasmuch as it is capable of meaning \"despised,\" whereas פְרַע (para) signifies \"to let loose,\" \"to let go\" (cf. the German fahren lassen), and hence \"to overlook, or reject.\" Its force is fairly represented in the LXX., Ἀκύρους ἐποιεῖτε ἐμὰς βουλὰς, \"Ye rendered my counsel of no effect.\" Counsel (עֵצָה etsah); i.e. advice, in the sense of recommendations for doing good, as opposed to reproofs for the avoidance of evil (see vers. 23 and 30). Would none. The same verb, אַבַה (avah), occurs in vers. 10 and 30, hence used with the negative לא (lo) in the sense of ἀπειθεῖν (LXX.), \"to refuse compliance with,\" as in AEschylus, 'Agam.,' 1049.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I also will laugh at your calamity; or, more accurately, in the time of your calamity; as in the Vulgate, in interitu vestro ridebo. The preposition prefixed to the substantive b'eyd'chem (בְּאֵידְכֵם) refers to the time, or state, or condition (Gesenius, 'Gram.,' 154, 3). In the time of their calamity wisdom will exult or rejoice. The LXX., Τῇ ὑμετέρᾳ ἀπλείᾳ ἐπιγελάσομαι, however, favours the rendering of the Authorized Version. Calamity (אֵיד, eyd) is heavy overwhelming misfortune, that which oppresses and crushes its victims. The terrific nature of the punishment of the wicked is marked by a succession of terms all of terrible import - calamity, fear, desolation, destruction, distress, and anguish (vers. 26, 27). When these come upon them, then Wisdom will laugh and have them in derision. The verbs \"laugh\" (שָׂחַק, sakhak) and \"mock\" (גאאל לָעַג) are the same as in Psalm 2:4, where they are rendered \"to mock\" and \"have in derision.\" When your fear cometh; i.e. has actually arrived. Fear (פַחַד pakhad); here used metonymically for that which causes the fear or terror (id, quod timebatis, Vulgate). There is a similar use of φόβος in 1 Peter 3:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - When your fear cometh as desolation. The imagery in this verse is borrowed from nature - from the tempest and whirlwind, which, in their impetuous fury, involve all in irretrievable ruin. The two leading ideas here in the writer's mind are calamity and fear. These - their fear, that which causes their fear; and their destruction, i.e. calamity - both representing Wisdom's, and so God's, judgment, will come on sinners as a wasting tempest and sweeping hurricane. The terror and devastation caused by these latter as they pass over the face of nature are employed to depict the alarm and ruin of sinners. Desolation; שַׁאֲוָה (shaavah) is a wasting, crashing tempest (cf. Proverbs 3:25; Zephaniah 1:15), derived from שָׁאַה (shaah). \"to make a crash,\" as of a house falling. The Vulgate reads, repentura calamitas; the LXX., ἄφνω θόρυβος; both bringing out the idea of suddenness, and the latter that of the uproar of the tempest. The Khetib, or traditional text of the manuscripts (כְשַׁאֲוָה), is equivalent to the Keri, or emended reading (כְשׁואָה), and both appear to have the same root meaning. Destruction (אֵיד, eyd); the same as \"calamity ' in the preceding verse. Whirlwind; סוּפָה (suphah), from the root סוּפ (suph), \"to snatch, or carry away,\" means a whirlwind carrying everything before it - the καταγίς of the LXX., or hurricane, as in Arist., 'Mund.,' 4, 16. Distress and anguish (צָרָה וְצוּקָה, tsarah v'tzukah). A corresponding alliteration occurs in Isaiah 30:6 and Zephaniah 1:15. The root signification of the former is that of compression, reproduced in the LXX. θλίψις, and the Vulgate tribulatio; that of the latter is narrowness. LXX., πολιορκία, \"a beleaguering;\" VUlgate, angustga. The LXX. adds, at the close of this verse, η} ὅταν ἔρχηται ὑμῖν ὅλεθρος as explanatory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The phase which the address now enters upon continues to the thirty-first verse. The change in this verse from the second to the third person is striking. It implies that Wisdom thinks fools no longer worthy of being addressed personally - \"Quasi stultos indignos censunt ulteriori alloquio\" (Gejerus and Michaelis). The declaration is the embodiment of the laughter and scorn of ver. 26. The three verbs, \"they shall call,\" \"they shall seek,\" \"they shall find,\" occur in uncommon and emphatic forms in the original. They are some out of the few instances where the future terminations are inserted fully before the pronominal suffix. I will not answer. The distress and anguish consequent upon their calamity and fear lead them to pray, but there will be no answer nor heed given to their cry. They are not heard, because they do not cry rightly nor in the time of grace (Lapide). See the striking parallel to the tenor of this passage in Luke 13:24-28. They shall seek me early; i.e. diligently. The verb שָׁחַר (shakhar) is the denominative from the substantive שַׁחַר (shakar), \"the dawn, morning,\" and signifies to go out and seek something in the obscurity of the morning twilight (Delitzsch, Zockler), and hence indicates diligence and earnestness in the search. Gesenius gives the same derivation, but connects it with the dawn in the sense of the light breaking forth, and thus, as it were, seeking (see also Proverbs 2:27; 7:15; 8:17; Hosea 5:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29 and 30 belong to ver. 28, and are not the antecedent clauses to ver. 31, as Zochler remarks. They recapitulate the charges already made against the sinners in vers. 22 and 25, and now set them forth as the ground or reason why Wisdom, on her part, turns a deaf ear to their entreatries. Wisdom will disregard the n because they have previously disregatded her. The connection is denoted in the LXX. by γὰρ, for the Hebrew takbath ki, equivalent to \"because,\" and in the Authorized Version by the punctuation. Did not choose the fear of the Lord. The verb \"to choose\" (בָּחַר, bakhar) combines in itself the meanings of eligere and diligere (Fleischer), and therefore signifies here not only choice of, but also the fuller sense of love for, the fear of the Lord. They despised; i.e. rejected the reproof with scorn or derision, sneered or turned up their noses at it (μυκτηρίζειν, LXX.), disparaged it (detrahere, Vulgate), or, more strongly, as Gejerus says, execrated it. Their rejection of reproof is stigmatized in stronger terms than in ver. 25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Therefore they shall eat, etc. A further enlargement of the declaration of Wisdom, showing that their calamity is the result of their own ways. The futures are resumed in the original from ver. 28. The word \"therefore\" does not occur, but it is met with in the LXX., τοιγαροῦν; in the Vulgate, igitur; and in the Syriac, ideo. The truth here expressed is accordant with the tenor of the teaching of the Scripture (comp. Proverbs 14:14; Proverbs 22:8; Job 4:8; Isaiah 3:10; Galatians 6:7, 8), and with our daily experience of God's moral government of the world (see Butler, 'Analogy,' part 1, ch. 2, ad fin.). This sentiment of retributive punishment also found expression in Terence, \"Tute hoc intristi, tibi omne est edendum\" ('Phorm.,' 2. 1. 4). When we are punished, the blameworthiness lies not with God, but with us sinners (Wardlaw). They shall be filled; rather, satiated, or surfeited; saturabuntur (Vulgate). The verb שָׁבַע (shava) means not only \"to fill,\" but \"to be satiated or cloyed\" (cf. Proverbs 14:14; Proverbs 25:16; Psalm 88:3; Psalm 123:4). Michaelis remarks on this word, \"Ad nauseam implebuntur et comedent, ita ut consiliorum suorum vehementer tandem, sed nimis sero, ipsos poeniteat\" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores in Prov.'), \"They shall be filled and eat ad nauseam, so that at length, but too late, they shall vehemently repent them of their own counsels.\" Counsels (מועֵצות, moetsoth); i.e. ungodly counsels, or evil devices. The word only occurs in the plural.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Wisdom now brings her address to a close by contrasting the destruction and ruin of the foolish, and the security of those who listen to her voice. The turning away; מְשׁוּבָה (m'shuvah), from שׁוּב(shuv), \"to turn about, or to return\" (which is used metaphorically of conversion), here means defection, turning away; and hence apostasy (aversio Vulgate, Chaldee Paraphrase, Syriac; perversitio, Cast. Version); the \"backsliding\" of Jeremiah 8:5; Hosea 11:7. Abea Ezra understands it to signify \"ease,\" as in the marginal reading; but there seems no warrant for taking the word in that sense. The LXX. renders the passage quite differently, Ἀνθ ῶν γὰρ ἠδίκουν νηπίους φονευθησονταί \"For because they wronged the young, they shall be slain;\" so also the Arabic. The turning away is from the warnings and invitations of Wisdom, and implies rebelliousness against God. The prosperity. The word in the original (שַׁלְוָה, shal'vah) is here used in a bad sense, and means \"carelessness, indolence,\" that carnal security which is induced by prosperity and worldly success, as in Jeremiah 22:21, \"I spoke to thee in thy prosperity (security), but thou saidst, I will not hear\" (cf. Ezekiel 16:49, where it is translated \"idleness.\" So Dathe translates, \"Incuria ignavorum eos perdit.\" The Chaldee Paraphrase and Syriac Versions read \"error.\" It occurs in a good sense as \"tranquillity,\" \"security,\" in Proverbs 17:1 and Psalm 122:7. The derivation of the word is from שָׁלָה (shalah). \"to be tranquil, to be safe, secure.\" Marines remarks that it is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity, because we endure adversity, we are corrupted by prosperity, and prosperity or ease makes fools mad. The false security of the prosperous is illustrated by our Lord in his parable of the rich fool (Luke 12:16-21). The LXX. differs again from the Hebrew in the second clause of this verse, καὶ ἐξετασμός ἀσεβεῖς ὀλεῖ; i.e. the carefully considered judgment of God concerning them shall destroy them. The LXX, is followed by the Arabia. Them; i.e. the fools themselves, and not other sinners, as Ben Ezra says, though the apparent security of fools, the impunity with which they seem to go on in their wickedness, and the success of their plans, may lead others to destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs1:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Hearkeneth unto me. Wisdom, in closing her address, draws a beautiful picture of the real security and peace of the righteous, as contrasted with the false security of the wicked. As on the one side rejection of her counsels, her warnings, and invitations, carries with it punishment and irretrievable ruin; so, on the other, the hearkening to her words, and loving obedience, are rewarded by her with the choicest blessings. Shall dwell safely; that is, with confidence, without danger (absque terrore, Vulgate). The phrase, ָשכַן בֶּטַד (shachan betakh), is used in Deuteronomy 33:12-18 of the safety with which the covenant people should dwell in the land that God had given them; but it is capable of a further extension of meaning beyond mere temporal security, viz. to the spiritual peace of the righteous. The psalmist also employs it to describe the confidence with which he awaits the resurrection, when he says, \"My flesh also shall rest in hope [or, 'dwell confidently']\" (Psalm 16:9). So here Wisdom promises that he who hearkens to her shall dwell calmly and undisturbed amidst the distractions of the world. The promise agrees with the description of Wisdom elsewhere that \"her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" And shall be quiet; (שַׁאֲנַן, shaanan, perfect pilel). Wisdom regards her assurance as already accomplished, and hence the perfect in the original is used for the future. The hearers and doers of her will shall live in tranquillity; nay, they are already doing so. It is a thing not only in prospect, but in possession. From fear of evil; i.e. either without any fear of evil, fear being removed (timore sublato, Vulgate), or, as the Authorized Version expresses it, connecting the phrase more intimately with the verb - \"quiet from fear of evil.\" It is not only evil, רֲעַה (raah), in its substantial form, as calamity, they are to be free from, but even the fear of it. The tranquillity will be supreme.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Wine is a mocker; or, scorner, the word (luts) being taken up from the last chapter. The liquor is, as it were, personified, as doing what men do under its influence. Thus inebriated persons scoff at what is holy, reject reproof, ridicule all that is serious. Septuagint, Ἀκόλαστον οϊνος, \"Wine is an undisciplined thing;\" Vulgate, Luxuriosa res, vinum. Strong drink is raging; a brawler, Revised Version. Shekar, σίκερα (Luke 1:15), is most frequently employed of any intoxicating drink not made from grapes, e.g. palm wine, mead, etc. The inordinate use of this renders men noisy and boisterous, no longer masters of themselves or restrained by the laws of morality or decency. Septuagint, Υβιστικὸν μέθη, \"Drunkenness is insolent.\" Theognis has some sensible lines on this matter ('Parch.,' 479) -NEWLINENEWLINEΟς δ α}ν ὑπερβάλλῃ πόσιος μὲτρον οὐκέτιNEWLINEΤῆς αὐτοῦ γλώσσης καρτερὸς οὐδὲ νόουNEWLINEΜυθεῖται δ ἀπάλαμνα τὰ νήφοσι γίγνεται αἰσχράNEWLINEΑἰδεῖται δ ἕρδων οὐδὲν ὅταν μεθύῃNEWLINEΤὸ πρὶν ἐὼν σώφρων τότε νήπιος Whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

The terror which a king causes when his anger is rising is like the roar of a lion, which betokens danger. Septuagint, \"The threat of a king differeth not from the wrath of a lion.\" Whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul; imperils his life, which he has no right wilfully to jeopard. Septuagint, \"He who enrageth him (ὁ παροξύνων αὐτόν).\" The Complutensian and some Greek versions introduce the words, καὶ ἐπιμιγνύμενος, \"and has intercourse with him;\" i.e. he who having aroused a king's resentment does not avoid his presence, exposes himself to certain death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It is an honour to a man to cease from strife; or better, as Delitzsch and others, to remain far from strife. A prudent man will not only abstain from causing quarrel, but will hold himself aloof from all contention, and thus will have due care for his own honour and dignity. How different is this from the modern cede, which makes a man's honour consist in his readiness to avenge fancied injury at the risk of his own or his neighbour's life! Septuagint, \"It is a glory to a man to hold himself aloof from revilings.\" Every fool will be meddling (see on Proverbs 17:14; 18:1). Delitzsch, \"Whoever is a fool showeth his teeth,\" finds pleasure in strife. Septuagint, \"Every fool involves himself in such,\" as in ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold; propter frigus, Vulgate. But חֹרֶפ (choreph) denotes the time of gathering - the autumn; so we would translate, \"At the time of harvest the sluggard ploughs not\" - just when the ground is most easily and profitably worked. \"The weakness of the coulter and other parts of the plough requires that advantage be taken, in all but the most friable soils, of the softening of the surface by the winter or spring rains; so that the peasant, if industrious, has to plough in the winter, though sluggards still shrink from its cold, and have to beg in the harvest\" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:491). Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. So the Vulgate, Mendicabit ergo aestate, et non dabitur illi. But this does not accurately represent the meaning of the clause. If ever the prosperous are disposed to relieve the needy, it would be at the time when they have safely garnered their produce; an appeal to their charity at such a moment would not be made in vain. Rather the sentence signifies that the lazy man, having neglected to have his land ploughed at the proper time, \"when he asks (for his fruits) at harvest time, there is nothing.\" He puts off tilling his fields day after day, or never looks to see if his labourers do their duty, and so his land is not cultivated, and he has no crop to reap when autumn comes. \"By the street of By-and-by one arrives at the house of Never\" (Spanish proverb). Taking a different interpretation of the word choreph, the LXX. renders, \"Being reproached, the sluggard is not ashamed, no more than he who borrows corn in harvest.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCounsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water. The thoughts and purposes of a man are hidden in his breast like deep water (Proverbs 18:4) in the bosom of the earth, hard to fathom, hard to get. But a man of understanding will draw it out. One who is intelligent and understands human nature penetrates the secret, and, by judicious questions and remarks, draws out (ἐξαντλήσει, Septuagint) the hidden thought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMost men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness; chesed, \"kindness,\" \"mercy,\" \"liberality,\" as in Proverbs 19:22. So Ewald and others, Hitzig and Kamphausen translate, \"Many a man one names his dear friend;\" Delitzsch and Nowack prefer, \"Most men meet a man who is gracious to them;\" i.e. it is common enough to meet a man who seems benevolent and well disposed. Vulgate, \"Many men are called merciful;\" Septuagint, \"Man is a great thing, and a merciful man is a precious thing.\" The renderings of most modern commentators imply the statement that love and mercy are common enough, at least in outward expression. The Authorized Version pronounces that men are ready enough to parade and boast of their liberality, like the hypocrites who were said proverbially to sound a trumpet when they performed their almsdeeds (Matthew 6:2). Commenting on the Greek rendering of the clause given above, St. Chrysostom observes, \"This is the true character of man to be merciful; yea, rather the character of God to show mercy... Those who answer not to this description, though they partake of mind, and are never so capable of knowledge, the Scripture refuses to acknowledge them as men, but calls them dogs, and horses, and serpents, and foxes, and wolves, and if there be any animals more contemptible\" ('Hom. 4 in Phil.' and 'Hom. 13 in 1 Tim.,' Oxford transl.). The contrast between show, or promise, and performance is developed in the second clause. But a faithful man who can find? The faithfulness intended is fidelity to promises, the practical execution of the vaunted benevolence; this is rare indeed, so that a psalmist could cry, \"I said in my haste, All men are liars\" (Psalm 116:11; comp. Romans 3:4). Lesetre refers to Massillon's sermon, 'Sur la Gloire Humaine,' where we read (the preacher, of course, rests on the Latin Version), \"Ces hommes vertueux dont le monde se fait tant d'honneur, n'ont au fond souvent pour eux que l'erreur publique. Amis fideles, je le veux; mais c'est le gout, la vanite ou Pin teret, qui les lie; et dans leur amis, ils n'amient qu' eux-memes En un mot, dit l'Ecriture, on les appelle misericordieux, ils ont toutes les vertus pour le public; mais n'etant pas fideles a Dieu, ils n'en ont pas une seule pour eux-memes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The just man walketh in his integrity. It is better to connect the two clauses together, and not to take the first as a separate sentence, thus: \"He who as a just man walketh in his integrity\" - Blessed are his children after him (comp. Proverbs 14:26). So the Septuagint and Vulgate. The man of pure life, who religiously performs his duty towards God and man, shall bring a blessing on his children who follow his good example, both during his life and after his death. The temporal promise is seen in Exodus 20:6; Deuteronomy 4:40; Psalm 112:2, etc. Some see here an instance of utilitarianism; but it cannot be supposed that the writer inculcates virtue for the sake of the worldly advantages connected with it; rather he speaks from experience, and from a faithful dependence on Providence, of the happy results of a holy life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - A royal and right noble maxim. A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. The king, sitting on the tribunal and executing his judiciary office, sees through all devices and pretences which cloak evil, and scatters them to the winds, as the chaff flies before the winnowing fan. Nothing unrighteous can abide in his presence (comp. ver. 26; Proverbs 16:10, etc.). See here an adumbration of the characteristic of the Messiah, the great King whose \"eyes behold, whose eyelids try, the children of men\" (Psalm 11:4): who is \"of purer eyes than to behold evil\" (Habakkuk 1:13); who \"with righteousness shall judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall slay the wicked\" (Isaiah 11:4; comp. Matthew 3:12). Septuagint, \"When the righteous king shall sit upon his throne, nothing that is evil shall offer itself before his eyes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? The question implies the answer, \"No one.\" This is expressed in Job 14:4, \"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.\" At the dedication of the temple, Solomon enunciates this fact of man's corruption, \"There is no man that sinneth not\" (1 Kings 8:46). The prophet testifies, \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is desperately sick: who can know it?\" (Jeremiah 17:9). And St. John warns, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us\" (1 John 1:8). The heart is cleansed by self-examination and repentance; but it is so easy to deceive one's self in this matter, sins may lurk undetected, motives may be overlooked, so that no one can rightly be self-righteous, or conceited, or proud of his spiritual state. The \"my sin\" at the end of the clause is rather possible than actual sin; and the expression means that no one can pride himself on being secure from yielding to temptation, however clean for a time his conscience may be. The verse, therefore, offers a stern corrective of two grievous spiritual errors - presumption and apathy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDivers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Divers weights, and divers measures; literally, stone and stone, ephah and ephah. The stones were used for weighing: dishonest traders kept them of different weights, and also measures of different capacities, substituting one for the other in order to defraud unwary customers. The Septuagint makes this plain by rendering, \"A weight great and small, and measures double\" (see on Proverbs 11:1 and Proverbs 16:11; and comp. ver. 23). The ephah was a dry measure, being one-tenth of the homer, and occupying the same position in solids as the bath did in liquids. It equalled about three pecks of our measure. Both of them are alike abomination to the Lord (Proverbs 17:15; comp. Leviticus 19:36; Deuteronomy 25:13, etc.); Septuagint, \"Are impure before the Lord, even both of them, and he who doeth them.\" Pseudo-Bernard ('De Pass. Dom.,' 17.), applying the passage mystically, teaches that a man may be said to keep a double measure, who, being conscious of his own evil character, endeavours to appear righteous to others; who, as he puts it, \"Suo judicio terrae proximus est, et aliis cupit elevatus videri.\" Others, connecting this verse in thought with the preceding, see in it a warning against judging a neighbour by a standard which we do not apply to ourselves. The Septuagint Version arranges the matter from ver. 10 onwards differently from the Hebrew, omitting vers. 14-19, and placing vers. 10-13 after ver. 22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Even a child is known (maketh himself known) by his doings. (For \"even\" (gam), see on Proverbs 17:26.) A child is open, simple, and straightforward in his actions; he has not the reserves and concealments which men practise, so you see by his conduct what his real character and disposition are. Ewald takes מעלליו in the sense of \"play,\" \"games;\" but it seems never to have this meaning, and there is no need to change the usual signification. The habits of a life are learned in early age. The boy is father of the man. Delitzsch quotes the German proverbs, \"What means to become a hook bends itself early,\" and \"What means to become a thorn sharpens itself early;\" and the Aramaean, \"That which will become a gourd shows itself in the bud:\" Whether his work be pure (\"clean,\" as ver. 9 and Proverbs 16:2), and whether it be right. His conduct will show thus much, end will help one to prognosticate the future. Septuagint (according to the Vatican), \"In his pursuits (ἐπιήδευμασιν) a young man will be fettered in company with a holy man, and his way will be straight,\" which seems to mean that a good man will restrain the reckless doings of a giddy youth, and will lead him into better courses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them. This apothegm, which seems to be nothing but a trite truism, brings to notice many important consequences. First, there is the result noted in Psalm 94:9, \"He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?\" Hence we learn the sleepless providence of God. So 'Pirke Aboth,' \"Know that which is above thee, an eye that seeth all, an ear that heareth all.\" We learn also that all things are directed and overruled by God (comp. Proverbs 15:3; Proverbs 16:4). Then there is the thought that these powers of ours, being the gift of God, should be used piously and in God's service. \"Mine ears hast thou opened... Lo, I come... I delight to do thy will, O my God\" (Psalm 40:6, etc.). The eye should be blind, the ear deaf, to all that might defile or excite to evil (see Isaiah 33:15). But it is the Lord alone that enables the spiritual organs to receive the wondrous things of God's Law; they must be educated by grace to enable them to perform their proper functions. \"God hath given us eyes,\" says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 22 in 1 Corinthians'), \"not that we may look wantonly, but that, admiring his handiwork, we may worship the Creator. And that this is the use of our eyes is evident from the things which are seen. For the lustre of the sun and of the sky we see from an immeasurable distances, but a woman's beauty one cannot discern so far off. Seest thou that for this end our eye was chiefly given? Again, he made the ear, that we should entertain not blasphemous words, but saving doctrines. Wherefore you see, when it receives anything dissonant, both our soul shudders and our very body also. And if we hear anything cruel or merciless, again our flesh creeps; but if anything decorous and kind, we even exult and rejoice.\" \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" Septuagint, \"The ear heareth and the eye sooth, and both are the works of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLove not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Love not sleep lest thou come to poverty (see Proverbs 6:9, etc.). The fate of the sluggard is handled again in Proverbs 23:21, as often before; e.g. Proverbs 12:11; Proverbs 19:15. The LXX., taking שֵׁנָה (shenah), \"sleep,\" as perhaps connected with the verb שְׁנָה (shanah), translate, \"Love not to rail, that thou be not exalted (ἵνα μὴ ἐξαρωῇς),\" i.e. probably, \"Do not calumniate others in order to raise yourself;\" others translate, \"lest thou be cut off.\" Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satired with bread. These words seem to connect this clause with ver. 12. God gives the faculty, but man must make due use thereof. The gnomist urges, \"Do not slumber at your post, or sit downwardly waiting; but be up and doing, be wakeful and diligent, and then you shall prosper.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer. The purchaser depreciates the goods which he wants, in order to lower the price demanded - a practice as common now as in old time. \"I don't want it, I don't want it,\" says the Spanish friar; \"but drop it into my hood.\" The Scotch say, \"He that lacks (disparages) my mare would buy my mare\" (Kelly). But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. When he has completed his purchase and obtained the goods at his own price, he boasts how he has tricked the seller. The LXX. omits vers. 14-19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - There is gold, and a multitude of rubies. For peninim, which is rendered \"rubies,\" \"pearls,\" or \"coral,\" see on Proverbs 3:15. There is gold which is precious, and there is abundance of pearls which are still more valuable. But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel, and worth more than all. We had the expression, \"lips of knowledge,\" in Proverbs 14:7; it means lips that utter wisdom. Keli, often translated \"jewel\" in the Authorized Version, also boars the meaning of \"vessel,\" \"utensil.\" So here the Vulgate, vas pretiosum; and the wise man's lips are called a vessel because they contain and distribute the wisdom that is within. (On the excellence and value of wisdom, see ch. Proverbs 3:14, etc; Proverbs 8:11, etc.) Connecting this with the preceding verse, we are led to the thought of buying, and the Lord's parable of the merchant seeking goodly pearls, and bartering all his wealth to gain possession of a worthy jewel (Matthew 13:45, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Take his garment that is surety for a stranger. The maxim is repeated in Proverbs 27:13; and warnings against suretyship are found in Proverbs 6:1, etc.; Proverbs 11:15; 17:18; 22:26, etc. The second portion of the clause is translated also, \"For he is surety for another.\" If a man is so weak and foolish as to become security for any one, and is unable to make good his engaged payment, let him lose his garment which the creditor would seize; his imprudence must bring its own punishment. And take a pledge of him for a strange woman. The Authorized Version probably adopts this rendering in conformity with Proverbs 27:13, where it occurs in the text, as here in the margin (the Keri). But the Khetib has, \"for strangers,\" which seems to be the original reading; and the first words ought to be translated, \"hold him in pledge;\" i.e. seize his person for the sake of the strangers for whom he has stood security, so as not to suffer loss from them. The Law endeavoured to secure lending to needy brethren without interest (see Psalm 15:5; Ezekiel 18:8, 13, etc.; Ezekiel 22:12): but it allowed the creditor to secure himself by taking pledges of his debtor, while it regulated this system so as to obviate most of its severity and oppressiveness (see the restrictions in Exodus 22:26, etc.; Deuteronomy 24:6, 12, etc.). \"Where the debtor possessed nothing which he could pledge, he gave the personal security of a friend. This was a very formal proceeding. The surety gave his hand both to the debtor and to the creditor before an assembly legally convened, he deposited a pledge, and, in accordance with this twofold promise, was regarded by the creditor in just the same light as the debtor himself, and treated accordingly. If the debtor, or in his place the surety, was unable to pay the debt when it fell due, he was entirely at the mercy of the creditor. The authorities troubled themselves but little about these relations, and the law, so far as it is preserved to us, gave no directions in the matter. We see, however, from many allusions and narratives, what harsh forms these relations actually took, especially in later times, when the ancient national brotherly love which the Law presupposed was more and more dying out. The creditor could not only forcibly appropriate all the movable, but also the fixed property, including the hereditary estate (this at least till its redemption in the year of jubilee), nay, he could even (if he could find nothing else of value) carry off as a prisoner the body of his debtor, or of his wife and child, to employ them in his service, though this could only he done for a definite period\" (Ewald, 'Antiquities,' p. 184, etc., transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; Revised Version, bread of falsehood; i.e. bread gained without labour, or by unrighteous means (comp. Proverbs 10:2). This is agreeable because it is easily won, and has the relish of forbidden fruit. \"Wickedness is sweet in his mouth\" (Job 20:12). But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. He will find in his \"bread\" no nourishment, but rather discomfort and positive injury (comp. Job 20:14). The expression, \"to eat gravel,\" is intimated in Lamentations 3:16, \"He hath broken my teeth with gravel stones;\" it implies grievous disappointment and unprofitableness. See here a warning against evil plesaures -NEWLINENEWLINEΦεῦγ ἡδονὴν φέρουσαν ὕστερον βλάβηνNEWLINENEWLINE\"Sperne voluptates: nocet empta dolore voluptas.\" Oort supposes that the gnome in the text is derived from a riddle, which asked, \"What is sweet at first, but afterwards like sand in the mouth?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Every purpose is established by counsel (comp. Proverbs 15:22, where see note). The Talmud says, \"Even the most prudent of men needs friends' counsels;\" and none but the most conceited would deem himself superior to advice, or would fail to allow that, as the Vulgate puts it, cogitationes consillis roborantur. This is true in all relations of life, in great and small matters alike, in peace, and, as our moralist adds, in war. With good advice make war; Vulgate, Gubernaculis tractanda sunt bella; Revised Version, By wise guidance make thou war. The word here used is takebuloth, for which see note, Proverbs 1:5. It is a maritime metaphor, rightly retained by the Vulgate, and might be rendered \"pilotings,\" \"steerings.\" War is a necessary evil, but it must be undertaken prudently and with a due consideration of circumstances, means, etc. Our Lord illustrates the necessity of due circumspection in following him by the case of a threatened conflict between two contending kings (Luke 14:31, etc.). Grotius quotes the gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEΓνῶμαι πλέον κρατοῦσιν η} σθένος χερῶν.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Titan strength of hands availeth counsel more.\" To which we may add -NEWLINENEWLINEΒουλῆς γὰρ ὀρθῆς οὐδὲν ἀσφαλέστερον.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Good counsel is the safest thing of all.\" (Comp.

Almost the same proverb occurs in Proverbs 11:13, The gadding gossiper is sure to let out any secret entrusted to him; therefore, it is implied, be careful in what you say to him. Meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips; rather, that openeth wide his lips - that cannot keep his mouth shut, a babbler, as Proverbs 13:3 (where see note). The Vulgate erroneously makes one sentence of the verse, \"With him who reveals secrets, and walketh deceitfully, and openeth wide his lips, have no dealings.\" Talmud, \"When I utter a word, it hath dominion over me; but when I utter it not, I have dominion over it.\" Says the Persian poet, \"The silent man hath his shoulders covered with the garment of security.\" Xenocrates used to say that he sometimes was \"sorry for having spoken, never for having kept silence\" (Cahen).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This is an enforcement of the fifth commandment, by denouncing the punishment which the moral government of God shall exact from the unnatural child. The legal penalty may be seen (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9); but this was probably seldom or never carried into execution (comp. Matthew 15:4; Mark 7:10). His lamp shall be put out in obscure (the blackest) darkness (comp. Proverbs 13:9). The expression is peculiar; it is literally, according to the Khetib, In the apple of the eye of darkness, as in Proverbs 7:9; i.e. in the very centre of darkness; he will find himself surrounded on all sides by midnight darkness, without escape, with no hope of Divine protection. \"Lamp\" is a metaphor applied to the bodily and the spiritual life, to happiness and prosperity, to a man's fame and reputation, to a man's posterity; and all these senses may be involved in the denunciation of the disobedient and stubborn child. He shall suffer in body and soul, in character, in fortune, in his children. His fate is the exact counterpart of the blessing promised in the Law. Septuagint, \"The lamp of him that revileth father and mother shall be extinguished, and the pupils of his eyes shall behold darkness.\" Talmud, \"Whosoever abandons his parents means his body to become the prey of scorpions.\" Cato, 'Dist.,' 3:23 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Dilige non aegra caros pietate parentes;NEWLINENec matrem offendas, dum vis bonus esse parenti.\" One of the evil generations denounced by Agur (Proverbs 30:11) is that which curseth parents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning - or, which in the beginning, is obtained in haste - but the end thereof shall not be blessed; or, its end shall not be blessed. The Khetib gives מְבֹהֶלֶת, which (comp. Zechariah 11:8) may mean \"detested,\" but this gives no sense; it is better, with the Keri, to replace kheth with he, and read מְבֹהֶלֶת (meboheleth), \"hastened,\" \"hastily acquired\" (see Proverbs 13:11, Septuagint). The maxim, taken in connection with the preceding verse, may apply to a bad son who thinks his parents live too long, and by violence robs them of their possessions; or to one who, like the prodigal in the parable, demands prematurely his portion of the paternal goods. But it may also be taken generally as denouncing the fate of those who make haste to be rich, being unscrupulous as to the means by which they gain wealth (see on Proverbs 23:11; 28:20, 22). A Greek gnome says roundly -NEWLINENEWLINEΟὐδεὶς ἐπλούτησεν ταχέως δίκαιος ὤν.NEWLINENEWLINE\"No righteous man e'er grew rich suddenly.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Say not thou, I will recompense evil (Proverbs 24:29). The jus talonis is the natural feeling of man, to do to others as they have done unto you, to requite evil with evil. But the moralist teaches a better lesson, urging men not to study revenge, and approaching nearer to Christ's injunction, which gives the law of charity, \"Whatsoever ye would (οπσα α}ν θέλητε) that men should do to you, do ye even so to them\" (Matthew 7:12). The Christian rule is expounded fully by St. Paul (Romans 12:14, 17, etc). It was not unknown to the Jews; for we read in Tobit 4:15, \"Do that to no man which thou hatest;\" and Hillel enjoins, \"Do not thou that to thy neighbour which thou hatest when it is done to thee.\" Even the heathens had excogitated this great principle. There is a saying of Aristotle, preserved by Diogenes Laertius, \"Act towards your friends as you would wish them to act towards you.\" The Chinese have a proverb, \"Water does not remain on the mountain, or vengeance in a great mind.\" Wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee. The pious writer urges the injured person to commit his cause to the Lord, not in the hope of seeing vengeance taken on his enemy, but in the certainty that God will help him to bear the wrong and deliver him in his own good time and way. The Christian takes St. Peter's view, \"Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?\" (1 Peter 3:13), knowing that \"all things work together for good to them that love God\" (Romans 8:28; comp. Ecclus. 2:2, 6). Septuagint, \"Say not, I will avenge myself on my enemy, but wait on the Lord, that (ἵνα) he may help thee.\" The last clause may be grammatically rendered thus, but it is more in accordance with the spirit st' the proverb, as Delitzsch observes, to regard it as a promise. Vulgate, et liberabit te.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDivers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23 - This is a repetition, with a slight variation, of ver. 10 and Proverbs 11:1 (where see notes). Is not good. A litotes, equivalent to \"is very evil,\" answering to \"abomination\" in the first member. Septuagint, \"is not good before him\" (comp. Proverbs 24:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMan's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Man's goings are of the Lord. In the first clause the word for \"man\" is geber, which implies \"a mighty man;\" in the second clause the word is adam, \"a human creature.\" So the Septuagint has ἀνὴρ in one clause and θνητὸς in the other. The proverb says that the steps of a great and powerful man depend, as their final cause, upon the Lord; he conditions and controls results. Man has free will, and is responsible for his actions, but God foreknows them, and holds the thread that connects them together; he gives preventing grace; he gives efficient grace: and man blindly works out the designs of Omnipotence according as he obeys or resists. A similar maxim is found in Psalm 37:23, \"A man's goings are established of the Lord,\" but the meaning there is that it is God's aid which enables a man to do certain actions. Here we have very much the same intimation that is found in Proverbs 2:6 and Proverbs 19:21; and see note on Proverbs 16:9. Hence arises the old prayer used formerly at prime, and inserted now (with some omissions) at the end of the Anglican Communion Service: \"O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, our thoughts, words, and actions, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection we may be preserved both here and forever.\" If man cannot see all sides, as God does, cannot comprehend the beginning, middle, and end in one view, how then can a man (a weak mortal) understand his own ways. How can he find out of himself whither he should go, or what will be the issue of his doings (comp. Proverbs 16:25; Jeremiah 10:23)? St. Gregory, \"It is well said by Solomon [Ecclesiastes 9:1], 'There are righteous and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God; and yet no man knoweth whether he is deserving of love or of hatred; but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come.' Hence it is said again by the same Solomon, 'What man will be able to understand his own way?' And any one doing good or evil is doubtless known by the testimony of his own conscience. But it is said that their own way is not known to men, for this reason, because, even if a man understands that he is acting rightly, yet he knows not, under the strict inquiry, whither he is going\" ('Moral.,' 29:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy. This verse, which is plainly a warning against rash vows, has received more than one interpretation. The Vulgate has, Ruina est homini devorare sanctos, which is explained to mean that it is destruction for a man to persecute the saints of God. But the word devorare is not certain, as the manuscripts vary between this and four other readings, viz. devotares, denotare, devovere, and devocare. The Authorized Version signifies that it is a sin to take for one's own consumption things dedicated to God, as firstfruits, the priests' portions, etc.: or a man's snare, i.e. his covetousness (1 Timothy 6:9), leads him to commit sacrilege. So Wordsworth. But it is best, with Delitzsch, to take יָלַע (yala) as the abbreviated future of לוּע or לָעַע, \"to speak rashly;\" and then kodesh, \"holiness,\" will be an exclamation, like korban (Mark 7:11). The clause will then run, \"It is a snare to a man rashly to cry, Holiness!\" equivalent to \"It is holy!\" i.e. to use the formula for consecrating something to holy purposes. Septuagint, \"It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate something of his own\" (comp. Ecclesiastes 5:2, 4, etc.). And after vows to make inquiry; i.e. after he has made his vow, to begin to consider whether he can fulfil it or not. This is a snare to a man, strangles his conscience, and leads him into the grievous sins of perjury and sacrilege. Septuagint, \"For after vowing ensueth repentance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - A wise king scattereth the wicked (ver. 8). The verb is zarah, which means \"to winnow, or sift.\" The king separates the wicked and the good, as the winnowing fan or shovel divides the chaff from the wheat. The same metaphor is used of Christ (Matthew 3:12), \"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire\" (comp. Jeremiah 15:7). Septuagint, \"A winnower (λικμήτωρ) of the ungodly is a wise king.\" And bringeth the wheel over them. The threshing wheel is meant (see Isaiah 28:27; Amos 1:3). This was a wooden frame with three or four rollers under it armed with iron teeth. It was drawn by two oxen, and, aided by the weight of the driver, who had his seat upon it, it crushed out the grain, and cut up the straw into fodder. Another machine much used in Palestine was made of two thick planks fastened together side by side, and having sharp stones fixed in rows on the lower surface. It is not implied that the king employed the corn drag as an instrument of punishment, which was sometimes so used in war, as possibly may be inferred from 2 Samuel 12:31; 1 Chronicles 20:3; and Amos 1:3. The idea of threshing is carried on, and the notion is rather of separation than of punishment, though the latter is not wholly excluded. The wise ruler will not only distinguish between the godless and the good, but will show his discrimination by visiting the evil with condign puuishment. Septuagint, \"He will bring the wheel upon them;\" the Vulgate has curiously, Incurvat super eos fornicem, \"He bends an arch over them,\" which Latin commentators explain as a triumphal arch, meaning that the king conquers and subdues the wicked, and celebrates his victory over them. A patent anachronism which needs no comment!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The spirit of men is the candle (lamp) of the Lord. Neshamah, \"spirit,\" or \"breath,\" is the principle of life breathed into man by God himself (Genesis 2:7), distinguishing man from brutes - the conscious human soul. We may consider it as equivalent to what we Christians call conscience, with its twofold character of receiving light and illumination from God, and sitting as judge and arbiter of actions. It is named \"the Lord's lamp,\" because this moral sense is a direct gift of God, and enables a man to see his real condition. Our Lord (Matthew 6:23) speaks of the light that is in man, and gives a solemn warning against the danger of letting it be darkened by neglect and sin; and St. Paul (1 Corinthians 2:11) argues, \"Who among men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man, which is in him?\" As Elihu says (Job 32:8), \"There is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.\" And Aristotle speaks of practical wisdom (φρόνησις) combined with virtue as \"the eye of the soul (ὄμμα τῆς ψυχῆς).\" Searching all the inward parts of the belly; i.e. the very depths of the soul, probing thoughts, desires, affections, will, and approving or reproving, according as they are in conformity with or opposition to God's Law. We must remember that Eastern houses, before the introduction of glass, had very scanty openings to admit light, and lamps were necessary if for any purpose the interior had to be thoroughly illuminated. Hence the metaphor used above would strike an Oriental more forcibly than it strikes us. Septuagint, \"The breath (πνοὴ, as Proverbs 11:13) of man is a light of the Lord, who searches the chambers of the belly.\" St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 12:64), \"We ought to bear in mind that in holy Writ by the title of the 'belly,' or the 'womb,' the mind is used to be understood. For the light of grace, which comes from above, affords a 'breathway' to man unto life, which same light is said to 'search all the inward parts of the belly,' in that it penetrates all the secrets of the heart, that the things which were hidden in the soul touching itself it may bring back before the eyes thereof\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Mercy and truth preserve the king. (For \"mercy and truth,\" see note on Proverbs 3:3.) The love and faithfulness which the king displays in dealing with his subjects elicits the like virtues in them, and these are the safeguard of his throne. His throne is upholden by mercy; or, love. So the king is well called the father of his people, and in modern times the epithet \"gracious\" is applied to the sovereign as being the fountain of mercy and condescension. Sallust, 'Jugurtha,' 10, \"Non exercitus neque thesauri praesidia regni sunt, verum amici, quos neque armis cogere neque auro parare queas; officio et fide pariuntur.\" Septuagint, \"Mercy (ἐλεημοσύνη) and truth are a guard to a king, and will surround his throne with righteousness.\" \"The subject's love,\" says our English maxim, \"is the king's lifeguard.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The glory of young men is their strength. That which makes the ornament (tiphereth) of youth is unimpaired strength and vigour, which can only be attained by due exercise combined with self-control. The moralist (Ecclesiastes 11:9) bids the young man rejoice in his youth, and let his heart cheer him in those happy days, but at the same time remember that he is responsible for the use which he makes of his powers and faculties, for for all these things God will bring him to judgment. The Greek gives a needful warning -NEWLINENEWLINEΜέμνησο νέος α}ν ὡς γέρων ἔσῃ ποτέNEWLINENEWLINE\"In youth remember thou wilt soon be old.\" Septuagint, \"Wisdom is an ornament to young men.\" But koach is bodily, not mental, power. The beauty of old men is the grey head (Proverbs 16:31). That which gives an honorable look to old age is the hoary head, which suggests wisdom and experience (comp. Ecclus. 25:3-6). On the other hand, the Greek gnomist warns -NEWLINENEWLINEΠολιὰ χρόνου μήνυσις οὐ φρονήσεως.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Grey hairs not wisdom indicate, but age.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs20:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil. So the Vulgate, Livor vulneris absterget mala. Chaburoth means \"stripes,\" and the proverb says that deep-cutting stripes are the only effectual cure of evil; i.e. severe punishment is the best healing process in cases of moral delinquency (Proverbs 19:29). Painful remedies, incisions, cauteries, amputations, are often necessary in the successful treatment of bodily ailments; spiritual sickness needs sterner, more piercing, remedies. So do stripes the inward parts of the belly; or better, and strokes that reach, etc. The stings of conscience, warnings and reproofs which penetrate to the inmost recesses of the heart, chastisement which affects the whole spiritual being. - these are needful to the correction and purification of inveterate evil. Aben Ezra connects this verse with the preceding thus: as strength gives a glory to young men, and hoar hairs adorn an old man, so wounds and bruises, so to speak, ornament the sinner, mark him out, and at the same time heal and amend him. It may also be connected with ver. 27. If a man will not use the lamp which God has given him for illumination and correction, he must expect severe chastisement and sternest discipline. Septuagint, \"Bruises (ὑπώπια) and contusions befall bad men, and plagues that reach to the chambers of the belly.\" St. Gregory, 'Moral.,' 23:40, \"By the blueness of a wound he implies the discipline of blows on the body. But blows in the secret parts of the belly are the wounds of the mind within, which are inflicted by compunction. For as the belly is distended when filled with food, so is the mind puffed up when swollen with wicked thoughts. The blueness, then, of a wound, and blows in the secret parts of the belly, cleanse away evil, because both outward discipline does away with faults, and compunction pierces the distended mind with the punishment of penance. But they differ from each other in this respect, that the wounds of blows give us pain, the sorrows of compunction have good savour. The one afflict and torture, the others restore when they afflict us. Through the one there is sorrow in affliction, through the other there is joy in grief\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water. We are to think of the little channels used for irrigation. As these are altogether under the gardener's control, so the heart of the king, who might seem to have no superior, is directed by God. He turneth it whithersoever he will. By hidden influences and providential arrangements God disposes the monarch to order his government so as to carry out his designs, to spread around joy and plenty. The system of irrigation signified in this passage is still to be seen in Eastern lands. \"Flower beds and gardens of herbs are always made at a little lower level than the surrounding ground, and are divided into small squares, a slight edging of earth banking the whole round on each side. Water is then let in, and floods the entire surface till the soil is thoroughly saturated; after which the moisture is turned off to another bed, by simply closing the opening in the one under water, by a turn of the bare foot of the gardener, and making another in the same way with the foot, in the next bed, and thus the whole garden is in due course watered .... Only, in this case, the hand is supposed to make the gap in the clay bank of the streamlet, and divert the current\" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 1:9).

The superiority of moral obedience to ceremonial worship is often inculcated (see note on Proverbs 15:8, and below, ver. 27; and comp. Micah 6:6-8 and Matthew 12:7). \"Justice\" and \"judgment\" (tsedakah and mishpat) are combined in Genesis 18:19; 2 Samuel 8:15; Job 37:23; Isaiah 56:1, etc. They imply equity and justice proceeding, not from bare regard to law, but from the principle of love. Septuagint, \"To do justify and to speak the truth are more pleasing to God than the blood of sacrifices.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - An high look and a proud heart; Vulgate, exaltatio oculorum est dilatatio cordis, \"The lifting up of the eyes is a swelling of the heart.\" But it is best to make the whole verse one idea, as in the Authorized Version. The lifting of the eyes is a term implying pride, as shown in supercilious looks, as if other people were of inferior clay and not worthy of notice. So we have \"haughty eyes\" in Proverbs 6:17 (where see note); and in Proverbs 30:13 we read, \"There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.\" \"The enlargement of the heart\" is the cause of the proud look, for it signifies the evil affections and concupiscence of the will, wholly filled up with self, and controlling the actions and expression of the body. Septuagint, \"A high-minded man (κεηαλόφρων) is stout-hearted in his pride.\" And the ploughing of the wicked is sin. The Authorized Version takes the reading נִר (nir), which means \"tillage' (Proverbs 13:23), or, as Delitzsch supposes, \"land ploughed for the first time\" (novale). The proverb, taken thus, will mean, \"high look, proud heart, even all the field which the godless cultivate, all that they do, is sin.\" \"Pride,\" says the Talmud, \"is worse than sin.\" But another pointing gives a different and very appropriate (comp. Proverbs 13:9; Proverbs 24:20) meaning. נֵר (ner) signifies \"a lamp.\" Thus the Vulgate, Lucerna impiorum peccatum, \"The lamp of the wicked is sin;\" and the Septuagint, Λαμπτὴρ δὲ ἀσεβῶν ἁμαρτία \"Lamp\" is, as often, a metaphor for prosperity and happiness (comp. 2 Samuel 22:29; 1 Kings 11:36); and it is here said that the sinner's outward prosperity and joyousness, springing from no good source, being founded in self, and not resting on virtue and godliness, are in themselves sinful and displeasing to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness. Patient industry is rewarded by a certain increase (comp. Proverbs 12:11; Proverbs 13:11; Proverbs 14:23). Says an English maxim, \"Diligence is a fair for tune, and industry a good estate,\" The Greek gnomists have said tersely -NEWLINENEWLINEΑπαντα τὰ καλὰ τοῦ πονοῦντος γίγνεταιNEWLINEΤῷ γὰρ πονοῦντι καὶ Θεὸς συλλαμβάνειNEWLINENEWLINE\"To him who labours all good things accrueNEWLINEThe man who labours God himself assists.\" But of every one that is hasty only to want. Diligence is contrasted with hastiness. The hasting to be rich by any, even nefarious, means (Proverbs 20:21; Proverbs 28:20) will bring a man to poverty. There are numerous proverbs warning against precipitancy, which will occur to everyone: Festina lente; \"More haste, less speed;\" \"Eile mit Weile.\"NEWLINENEWLINEΠροπέτεια σολλοῖς ἐστὶν αἰτία κακῶν. (See a long dissertation on Festinatio praepropera in Erasmus's 'Adagia.') This verse is omitted in the chief manuscripts of the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The getting of treasures by a lying tongue - the acquisition of wealth by fraud and falsehood - is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. The latter clause is variously rendered and interpreted. The Hebrew is literally, a fleeting breath, those seeking death. The Revised Version makes the last words a separate proposition, \"They that seek them seek death.\" But this seems unnecessary, and somewhat opposed to the gnomic style, which often combines two predicates in one construction; and there is no reason why we should not render the words, as in the Authorized Version, \"of seekers of death.\" Such a mode of obtaining wealth is as evanescent and unstable as the very breath, and ends in death, which is practically the result of their quest. Thus Wisd. 5:14, \"The hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with the tempest, and passeth away. as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.\" Some think that the comparison regards the mirage of the desert, which deceives travellers with the phantasms of cool waters and refreshing shade. Such an allusion is found in Isaiah 35:7. The Talmud enjoins, \"Speak no word that accords not with the truth, that thy honour may not vanish as the waters of a brook.\" The Septuagint and Vulgate have followed a different reading (מוק שׁי־מות), and render thus: Vulgate, Vanus et excors est, et impingetur ad laqueos mortis, \"He is vain and foolish, and will be taken in the snares of death;\" Septuagint, \"pursues vain things unto the snares of death (ἐπὶ παγίδας)\" (Proverbs 13:14; Proverbs 14:27). So St. Paul says (1 Timothy 6:9), \"They that desire to be rich fall into a into a temptation and a snare (παγίδα), and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; Vulgate, rapinae impiorum detrahenteos; Revised Version, \"The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away,\" like chaff before the wind. The violence with which they treat others shall rebound on themselves, shall bring its own punishment; they shall sink in the pit that they made, and their foot shall be taken in the net which they hid (Psalm 9:15; comp. Proverbs 1:18, 19). Septuagint, \"Destruction shall sojourn as guest (ἐπιξενωθήσεται) with the ungodly.\" The reason of this fate is given in the concluding hemistich: Because they refuse to do judgment. This is a judicial retribution on them for wilfully declining (ver. 25) to do what is right.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The way of man is froward and strange; Vulgate, Perversa via viri, aliens est. Both this and the Authorized Version miss the antithesis between the guilty and the pure man, which is intended. In וזר, translated \"and strange\" (which seems to mean \"alien from what is right\"), the vav is not the copulative, but part of the word, which is an adjective signifying \"laden with guilt;\" so that the clause ought to be rendered, \"Crooked is the way of a guilty man\" (see note on Proverbs 2:15, where, however, the word is different, though the idea is analogous). An evil man's way of life is not open and straightforward, simple and uniform, but stealthy, crooked, perverse, whither his evil inclinations lead him. Septuagint, \"To the crooked (σκολιοὺς) God sendeth crooked ways;\" which recalls Psalm 18:26, \"With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.\" God allows the wicked to punish themselves by falling into mischief. As for the pure, his work is right; or, straight (Proverbs 20:11). The pure in heart will be right in action; he follows his conscience and God's law, and goes direct on his course without turning or hesitation. The LXX. refers the clause to God: \"for pure and right are his ways.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop. One is to think of the flat roof of an Eastern house, which was used as an apartment for many purposes: e,g. for sleeping and conference (1 Samuel 9:25, 26), for exercise (2 Samuel 11:2), for domestic matters (Joshua 2:6), for retirement and prayer (Psalm 102:7; Acts 10:9). This, though exposed to the inclemency of the weather, would be not an uncomfortable situation during a great part of the year. But the proverb implies a position abnormally inconvenient as an alternative preferable to a residence inside. Hence, perhaps, it is advisable to render, with Delitzsch, \"Better to sit on the pinhole of a house roof.\" Septuagint, \"It is better to dwell in a corner of a place open to the sky (ὑπαίθρου).\" Than with a brawling (contentious) woman in a wide house; literally, a house of society; i.e. a house in common (comp. ver. 19 and Proverbs 25:24). A solitary corner, replete with inconveniences, is to be preferred to house shared with woman, wife or other female relation, of a quarrelsome and vexatious temper. The LXX. puts the matter forcibly, \"than in cieled rooms with unrighteousness and in a common house.\" So the Latin proverb, \"Non quam late, sed quam laete habites, refert.\" The Scotch have a proverb to the same effect: \"A house wi' a reek and a wife wi' a reerd (scold) will sune mak' a man run to the door.\" \"I had rather dwell,\" says the Son of Sirach (Ecclus. 25:16), \"with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The soul of the wicked desireth veil. A wicked man cannot rest without planning and wishing for some new evil thing. Nothing is safe from his malignant activity (comp. Proverbs 4:16; Proverbs 10:23). His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes (Isaiah 13:18; Isaiah 26:10). He does not look with pity on friend or neighbour, if they stand in the way of the gratification of his desires; he will sacrifice any one, however closely connected, so that he may work his will. Nothing makes a man more atrociously selfish and hard-hearted than vice (see Proverbs 12:10, and the note there). The LXX. takes the sentence in a passive sense, \"The soul of the ungodly shall not be pitied by any one.\" They who have no pity for others shall meet with no pity themselves; while, on the other hand, the Lord says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\" (Matthew 5:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise. We had the same thought at Proverbs 19:25 (where see note). The simple (parvulus, Vulgate) profit by the punishment of the incorrigibly evil But the wise need not chastisement for their improvement. When the wise is instructed (Psalm 32:6), he (the wise) receiveth knowledge. The wise man uses every opportunity, takes advantage of every circumstance and event, to increase his knowledge and experience. The Vulgate carries on the subject, \"And if he (the simple) follow the wise man, he shall attain knowledge.\" Septuagint, \"When the intemperate man is punished, the simple is made cleverer; and a wise man understanding will receive knowledge.\" \"For it often happens,\" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:38). \"that the mind of the weak is the more unsteadied from the hearing of the truth, as it sees the despisers of the truth flourishing; but when just vengeance takes away the unjust, it keeps others away from wickedness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. The Authorized Version introduces the words \"but God\" in order to eke out the sense desired; the Revised Version, for the same reason, has, \"how the wicked are overthrown;\" and both versions signify that the good man contemplates the fortunes and seeming prosperity of the wicked, and, looking to the end of these men, sees how hollow is their success and what a fatal issue awaits them. The Vulgate refers the passage to the zeal of the righteous for the salvation of sinners - a thought quite foreign to the present subject - thus: Excogitat justus de domo impii, ut detrahat impios a malo, \"The righteous man reflects concerning the house of the wicked how he may deliver them from evil.\" The Hebrew is literally, A righteous one looketh on the house of the wicked: he precipitates the wicked to destruction. There is no change of subject in the two clauses, and \"a righteous One\" (tsaddik) is God, put indeterminately to excite the greater awe (comp. Job 34:17). The Lord keeps the sinners under his eye, that he may punish them at the fit moment (comp. Proverbs 22:12; Job 12:19). The notion of God's moral government of the universe prevails most strongly in every pronouncement of the writer. The LXX. interprets \"the house\" as heart and conscience, and renders, \"A righteous man understands the hearts of the godless, and despises the impious in their wickednesses;\" he sees through their outward felicity, knows well its unreality, and despises them for the low aims and pursuits which satisfy them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor. A twofold retribution is threatened on the unmerciful man. He also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. He himself shall tall into distress, and shall appeal to his neighbours for help in vain. \"With the same measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you again\" (Luke 6:38). This is true also in spiritual matters and in the final judgment (see on Proverbs 14:21 and Proverbs 19:17; and comp. Matthew 18:28, etc.; Matthew 25:41, etc.; James 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A gift in secret pacifieth anger. We have had above various maxims about bribes and presents; e.g. Proverbs 17:8, 23; Proverbs 18:16. The word translated \"pacifieth\" is from the ἅπαξ λεγόμενον verb כֵפָה, \"to turn away,\" \"avert.\" Septuagint, ἀνατρέπει; Vulgate, extinguit; Venetian, κάμψει. A gift offered secretly to one incensed, whether personal enemy, judge, or prince, averts the consequences of the offence. The next hemistich is parallel in meaning. And a reward (present) in the bosom strong wrath. A present kept handy in the bosom of the petitioner's garment, ready to be transferred at a fitting moment, as experience proves, calms the most violent wrath. Septuagint, \"He that is sparing of gifts amuses strong wrath.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - It is joy to the just to do judgment. The righteous feel real pleasure in doing what is right; they have the answer of a good conscience, and the feeling that they are, as far as they can, making God's will their will, and this brings deep comfort and stable joy (see some contrary experiences, ver. 10 and Proverbs 10:23; Proverbs 15:21). But destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. The Authorized Version, by inserting \"shall be,\" and making this clause a separate assertion, obscures the force of the original, which, as in Proverbs 10:29 (where see note), contrasts the effect of right-doing on the good and the evil. It is a joy to the former, \"but destruction [or, 'terror'] to them that work iniquity.\" Et pavor operantibus iniquitatem, Vulgate. They cannot trust themselves to do rightly without fear; they cannot commit the result to God, as the righteous do; if ever they do act uprightly, it is against their inclination, and such action will, as they fear, bring them to ruin. Septuagint, \"It is the joy of the righteous to do judgment; but a holy man is abominable (ἀκάθαρτος) among evil doers.\" So Wisd. 2:15, \"He [the rightous] is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion... he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness (ἀκαθαρσιῶν).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding. (For הַשְׂכֵּל, \"understanding,\" see note on Proverbs 1:3.) He who forsakes the way of wisdom, the path of virtue, the religious life, and thus becomes in proverbial language \"a fool,\" he shall remain (rest, dwell) in the congregation of the dead; in coetu gigantum commorabitur. \"The dead\" is, in the Hebrew, rephaim, for which see note on Proverbs 2:18. The denunciation means primarily that the sinner shall soon be with the shades of the dead, shall meet with a speedy death. Wordsworth considers that the writer is saying in bitter irony that the evil man shall rest as a guest at a banquet, shall lie down and be regaled, but it will be in the company of the dead. The contrast seems to lie between the wandering and the rest, and this rest is regarded as penal; so that one must needs see here an intimation of retribution after death; and setup, Proverbs 24:14, 20. The Fathers regarded the Rephaim, \"the giants,\" as the descendants of the rebel angels, in accordance with their interpretation of Genesis 6:1-4. Thus St. Gregory writes ('Moral.' 17:30), quoting our passage, \"For whosoever forsakes the way of righteousness, to whose number does he join himself, saving to the number of the proud spirits?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man; qui diligit epulas, Vulgate; for feasts are chiefly, though not exclusively, intended. He shall become \"a man of want\" (machesor) as Proverbs 11:24. He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. \"Wine and oil\" were the usual adjuncts of banquets (Psalm 23:5; Psalm 104:15). Some unguents used for anointing honoured guests were very costly. The pound of spikenard expended by Mary of Bethany was worth more than three hundred pence - the wages of a labourer for nearly a whole year (see John 12:3; Matthew 20:2). Indulgence in such luxuries would be a token of prodigality and extravagance, which are the sure precursors of ruin; while, on the other hand, according to the trite proverb, Magnum vectigal est parsimonia. That fulness of meat and luxurious habits tend to spiritual poverty and the loss of grace, need not be insisted on. Septuagint, \"A man in want (ἐνδεὴς) loveth mirth, loving wine and oil unto wealth (εἰς πλοῦτον).\" Some translate the last words, \"in abundance,\" as if the meaning was that the poor endeavours to mitigate the severity of his lot by getting all the pleasure he can from creature comforts however procured. Others think that a negative has fallen out of the Greek, which should be, \"not unto wealth,\" i.e. he shall not be enriched thereby.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous. The same thought occurs in Proverbs 11:8 (where see note). כֹּפֶר (kopher), \"price of atonement,\" means of reconciliation. Delitzsch instances that the great movement which gathered the nations together for the destruction of Babylon put an end to Israel's exile; and that Cyrus, the scourge of so many heathen peoples, was the liberator of the Jews (comp. Isaiah 44:28). And the transgressor for the upright. The faithless takes the place of the upright; the stroke passes over the latter, to fall on the former, as in Egypt the destroying angel spared the houses of the Israelites, and poured his wrath on the Egyptians. Septuagint, \"A transgressor is the offscouring (περικάθαρμα, perhaps equivalent to 'ransom') of a righteous man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - A variant of ver. 9. Here, instead of the \"corner of the roof,\" we have a wilderness, a desert land, as the refuge to which the persecuted man must flee. Than with a contentious and an angry (fretful) woman. So the Vulgate. But it seems better, with many modern commentators, to take וָכָעַם, not as another epithet, but as equivalent to \"and vexation,\" i.e. a quarrelsome wife, and the vexation that accompanies such an infliction. The LXX. adds a word to the text, as being at the root of the matter, \"Than with a quarrelsome, talkative, and passionate woman.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise. Precious treasure and store of provision and rich unguents (ver. 17) are collected in the house of the wise man, by which he may fare sumptuously, exercise hospitality, and lay up for the future (comp. Proverbs 24:4). But a foolish man spendeth it up. \"A fool of a man\" (Proverbs 15:20) soon swallows, runs through and exhausts, all that has been accumulated (ver. 17). Septuagint, \"A desirable ἐπιθυμητὸς treasure will rest on the mouth of the wise, but foolish men will swallow it up.\" It is obvious to apply the maxim to spiritual things, seeing in it the truth that the really wise man stores up treasures of Divine love and the oil of God's grace, while the foolish man wastes his opportunities, squanders his powers, and drives the Holy Spirit from him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He that followeth after righteousness and mercy. \"Righteousness\" (tsedakah), in the first hemistich, signifies the virtue which renders to all, God and man, their due, which is the characteristic of the righteous man (see on Proverbs 15:9). \"Mercy\" (chesed) is the conduct towards others, animated by love and sympathy (see note on Proverbs 3:3). Findeth life, righteoushess, and honor. \"Righteousness\" here is the gift of God to his faithful servants, grace to live a holy life. This becomes habit, and forms the righteous character (Job 29:14; Job 33:26). \"Life\" is a long and prosperous life in the world (Proverbs 3:16); \"honour\" is respect and reverence among fellow men, and glory in another world. \"Whom he justified, them he also glorified\" (Romans 8:80). \"Life and honour\" stand together in Proverbs 22:4. \"The fear of the Lord,\" says Siracides, \"is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing... maketh a merry heart... and giveth long life \"(Ecclus. 1:11, etc.). The LXX. omits the second \"righteousness\" by mistake: \"The way of righteousness and mercy will find life and glory\" (Matthew 6:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty. The courage and strength of valiant men cannot defend a city against the skilful counsel of a wise strategist. And he casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. He lays low the strength in which the defenders trusted; he not only takes the fortress, but also demolishes it. Wisdom is stronger than bodily might (Proverbs 20.18. See the apologue, Ecclesiastes 9:14, etc.). Septuagint, \"A wise man cometh upon strong cities, and casteth down the stronghold (καθεῖλε τὸ ὀχύρωμα) in which the ungodly trusted.\" Thus St. Paul, speaking of the weapons which God gives us to fight withal in the spiritual battle, says (2 Corinthians 10:4) that they are \"mighty before him to the casting down of strongholds (πρὸς καθαίρεσιν οχυρωμάτων).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - We have had similar maxims before (Proverbs 13:8 and Proverbs 18:21, where see notes). He keepeth his mouth, who knows when to speak and when to be silent; and he keepeth his tongue, who says only what is to the purpose. We have all heard the proverb, \"Speech is silver, silence is gold.\" One who thus takes heed of his words, keepeth his soul from troubles. The troubles (angores, Vulgate) are such as these - remorse for the evil occasioned, distress of conscience, vexation and strife with offended neighbours, danger of liberty and life, and, above all, the anger of God, and retribution in the judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTProud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. (For \"scorner\" (לצ), the esprit fort, the freethinking sceptic of Solomon's day, see notes on Proverbs 1:22 and Proverbs 14:6.) The verse is better translated, A proud, arrogant man, scoffer is his name, who worketh in superfluity of pride. עֶבְרָה (ebrah), translated \"wrath,\" denotes also want of moderation, excess, presumption (see note on Proverbs 11:23). The proverb explains the meaning of the name, letz, given to these rationalists; their contempt of revealed religion proceeds from pride of intellect, which refuses instruction, and blinds the eyes to the truth. The warning comes home to us in these times, when the \"higher criticism\" too often runs into gross scepticism and infidelity. Septuagint, \"A bold and self-willed and insolent man is called a pest (λοιμὸς), and he that remembers injuries is a transgressor.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The desire of the slothful killeth him. The craving for ease and rest, and the consequent disinclination for labour, prove fatal to the slothful man. Or, it may be, the mere wish, combined with no active exertion to secure its accomplishment, is fatal to soul, body, and fortune (comp. Proverbs 13:4; Proverbs 19:24). Lesetre quotes Bossuet, \"Le paresseux spirituel s'expose aussi a la mort eternelle; car les bone desirs ne suffisient pas pour le salut; il faut encore les oeuvres\" (see Matthew 7:21; Romans 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - St. Jerome and many commentators connect this verse with the preceding, considering the two to form a tetrastich, thus: The desire of the slothful... he coveteth greedily all the day long, but the righteous giveth and spareth not. But in this division of our book there are only pure distichs; and, as Delitzsch observes, to make the contrast, one requires in the first hemistich an expression like, \"and hath nothing\" (Proverbs 13:4; comp. Proverbs 20:4). So it is correct to consider this distich independent, and to translate, There is that (or one) desireth greedily always, but the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. There are claims made on all sides, demands for help, importunate prayers, such as one would think no man could satisfy; but the righteous has means enough and to spare, he is generous and charitable, he is industrious, and uses his stewardship well (Luke 16:9), and so arranges his expenditure that he has to give to him that needeth (Ephesians 4:28). Septuagint, \"An ungodly man devises evil devices all the day long, but the righteous pitieth and showeth compassion unsparingly.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The first hemistich occurs in Proverbs 15:8 (where see note). How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! rather, for evil, equivalent to \"in order to atone for wickedness.\" The sacrifice of the sinner is abominable, as offered formally without repentance and faith; much more abominable, when he brings his offering to win, as it were, God's connivance in the sin which he commits and has no intention of renouncing, - brings it as a kited of bribe and recompense to compensate or his transgression. Such an outrage on God's purity and justice may well be called an abomination. Septuagint, \"The sacrifices of the ungodly are abomination unto the Lord, for they. offer them wickedly (παρανόμως).\" The notion of propitiating the Deity by sharing with him the proceeds of sin is expressed in proverbial language. We have the homely saw, \"Steal the goose, and give the giblets in alms;\" and the Spaniards say, \"Huerto el puerco, y dar los pies por Dios,\" \"Steal the pig, and give away the pettitoes for God's sake\" (Kelly). (See Ecclus. 31:18, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - (For the first hemistich, see Proverbs 6:19; Proverbs 19:5, 9.) Shall perish. His testimony is worthless, and both he and it come to nothing. The man that heareth speaketh constantly; Vulgate, vir obediens; Septuagint, Ἀνὴρ ὑπήκοος φυλασσόμενος λαλήσει, \"An obedient man will speak guardedly.\" \"The man that heareth\" is one who is attentive, who listens before he speaks, and reports only what he has heard. Such a one will speak \"for continuance,\" so that what he says is never falsified, or silenced, or refuted. Vulgate, loquetur victoriam. And so Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, εἰς νίκος. Revised Version, unchallenged. The expression thus rendered is lanetsach, which means, in Hebrew at any rate, in perpetuum, \"for continuance.\" But St. Jerome's rendering has been much used by the Fathers, who have drawn therefrom lessons of obedience. Thus St. Augustine, 'In Psalm.,' 70, \"Sola obedientia tenet palmam, sola inobedientia invenit poenam.' St. Gregory, ' Moral,' 35:28, \"An obedient man in truth speaketh of victories, because, when we humbly submit ourselves to the voice of another, we overcome ourselves in our heart\" (Oxford transl.). See a long dissertation on obedience in the note of Corn. a Lapide on this passage of Proverbs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - A wicked man hardeneth his face; is shameless (as Proverbs 7:13), and is insensible to rebuke or any soft feeling. This obduracy he shows with his countenance. Septuagint, \"An ungodly man shamelessly withstands with his face.\" But as for the upright, he directeth his way. He gives it the right direction (2 Chronicles 27:6). This is the reading of the Khetib, יָכִין but, though generally adopted by the versions (except the Septuagint), it does not make a suitable antithesis to the rash stubbornness of the wicked. Hence modern commentators prefer the reading of the Keri, יָבִין, \"he considereth, proveth,\" his way; he acts only after due thought, giving proper weight to all circumstance. Septuagint, \"But the upright man himself understands (συνιεῖ) his ways.\" The contrast lies in the audacious self-confidence of the unprincipled man, and the calm circumspection and prudence of the saint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord; i.e. in opposition to him, which can be compared with his, or which can avail against him (comp. Job 5:13; Psalm 33:10, 11; Isaiah 29:14; 1 Corinthians 1:20; 1 Corinthians 3:19). Septuagint, \"There is no wisdom, there is no courage (ἀνδρεία), there is no counsel, in respect of the ungodly;\" πρὸς τὸν ἀσεβῆ, neged Jahve, being taken as \"that which is against Jahve,\" equivalent to \"impious.\" Wordsworth quotes Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:6. 5, etc. -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Dis te minorem quod geris, imperus:NEWLINEHino omne principium, huc refer exitum.\" The following verse carries on and applies the import of this one: As men's wisdom is nothing worth, equally vain is all trust in external means and appliances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs21:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The horse is prepared against the clay of battle. The horse is an emblem of military power and activity. To the earlier Jews, who were unaccustomed to its use, and indeed forbidden to employ it (Deuteronomy 17:16), the horse and horse-drawn chariots were objects of extreme terror (Joshua 17:16; Judges 4:3), and though Solomon had largely imported them from Egypt (1 Kings 4:26; 1 Kings 10:26, etc.), these animals were used exclusively for war, and, at this time, their services were never applied to agricultural purposes. The proverb asserts that, though all preparations are made for the battle, and material forces are of the best and strongest description, but safety (victory) is of the Lord (see Psalm 20:7; Psalm 33:16, etc.). Septuagint, \"But from the Lord is the help (ἡ βοήθεια).\" The great truth here taught may be applied to spiritual matters. The only safety against spiritual enemies is the grace of God; we can cry, with St. Paul (1 Corinthians 15:57), \"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \"By the name 'horse,'\" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 31:43), \"is understood the preparation of right intention, as it is written, 'The horse is prepared,' etc.; because the mind prepares itself indeed against temptation, but contends not healthfully unless it be assisted from above.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches. It will be observed that \"good\" in the Authorized Version is in italics, showing that the epithet is not expressed in the Hebrew, which is simply שֵׁם (shem), \"name.\" But this word carried with it the notion of good repute, as in Ecclesiastes 7:1; for being well known implied honour and reputation, while being nameless (Job 30:8) signified not only obscurity, but ignominy and discredit. Hence the versions have ὄνομα καλόν, nomen bonum, and Ecclus. 41:12, \"Have regard to thy name (περὶ ὀνόματος), for that shall continue with thee above a thousand great treasures of gold. A good life,\" the moralist continues, \"hath but few days; but a good name endureth forever\" (contrast Proverbs 10:7). And loving favour rather than silver and gold; or, more accurately, and before gold and silver grace is good; i.e. grace is far better than gold. Grace (chen) is the manner and demeanour which win love, as well as the favour and affection gained thereby; taken as parallel to \"name,\" in the former hemistich, it means here \"favour,\" the regard conceived by others for a worthy object. Publ. Syr., \"Bona opinio hominum tutier pecunia est.\" The French have a proverb, \"Bonne renommee vaut mieux que ceinture doree.\" The latter hemistich gives the reason for the assertion in the former - a good name is so valuable because it wins affection and friendship, which are far preferable to material riches,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The rich and poor meet together (Proverbs 29:13): the Lord is the Maker of them all (Job 34:19). God has ordained that there shall be rich and poor in the world, and that they should meet in the intercourse of life. These social inequalities are ordered for wise purposes; the one helps the other. The labour of the poor makes the wealth of the rich; the wealth of the rich enables him to employ and aid the poor. Their common humanity, their fatherhood in God, should make them regard one another as brethren, without distinction of rank or position: the rich should not despise the poor (Proverbs 14:31; Proverbs 17:5; Job 31:15), the poor should not envy the rich (Proverbs 3:31), but all should live in love and harmony as one great family of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A prudent man foresesth the evil, and hideth himself. The whole verse is repeated in Proverbs 27:12. St. Jerome has callidus, and the LXX. has πανοῦργος, as the translation of עָרוּם (arum); but it must be taken in a good sense, as cautions, farseeing, prudent (see note on Proverbs 1:4) Such a man looks around, takes warning from little circumstances which might escape the observation of careless persons, and provides for his safety in good time. Thus the Christians at the siege of Jerusalem, believing Christ's warnings, retired to Pella, and wine saved. A Spanish proverb runs, \"That which the fool does in the end, the wise man does at the beginning.\" The simple pass on, and are punished. The subject of the former hemistich is in the singular number, for a really prudent man is a comparatively rare bring; the second clause is plural, teaching us, as Hitzig observes, that many simple ones are found for one prudent. These silly persons, blundering blindly on their way, without circumspection or forethought, meet with immediate punishment, incur dangers, suffer less. A Cornish proverb runs, \"He who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock.\" Septuagint, \"An intelligent man (πανοῦργος) seeing a wicked man punished is himself forcibly instructed; but fools pass by, and are punished\" (comp. Proverbs 21:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - By humility and the fear of the Lord, etc. This does not seem to be the best rendering of the original. The word rendered \"by\" (עֵקֶב ekeb), \"in reward of,\" is also taken as the subject of the sentence: \"The reward of humility ['and,' or, 'which is'] the fear of God, is riches,\" etc. There is no copulative in the clause, and a similar asyndeton occurs in ver. 5; so there is no reason why we should not regard the clause in this way. Thus Revised Version, Nowack, and others. But Delitzsch makes the first hemistich a concluded sentence, which the second member carries on thus: \"The reward of humility is the fear of the Lord; it [the reward of humility] is at the same time riches,\" etc. Vulgate, Finis modestiae timor Domini, divitiae et gloria et vita; Septuagint, \"The generation (γενεὰ) of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and wealth,\" etc. It is preferable to translate as above, taking the two expressed virtues as appositional, thus: \"The reward of humility, the fear of the Lord.\" Humility brings with it true religion, which is expressed by \"the fear of the Lord.\" The feeling of dependence, the lowly opinion of self, the surrender of the will, the conviction of sin, all effects which are connected with humility, may well be represented by this term, \"the fear of God,\" which, in another aspect, is itself the source of every virtue and every blessing; it is riches, and honour, and life. These are God's gifts, the guerdon of faithful service (see notes on Proverbs 3:16 and Proverbs 21:21; and comp. Proverbs 8:18). The Easterns have a pretty maxim, \"The bending of the humble is the graceful droop of the branches laden with fruit.\" And again, \"Fruitful trees bend down; the wise stoop; a dry stick and a fool can be broken, not bent\" (Lane).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5 - Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward. The words are in the Hebrew without the conjunction (see note, ver. 4), though the versions generally add it. Thus the Septuagint, τρίβολοι καὶ παγίδες; Vulgate, arma et gladiii but the Venetian, ἄκανθαι παγίδες. It is a question whether the thorns are what the perverse prepare for others, or what they themselves suffer. In Proverbs 15:19 the hedge of thorns represented the difficulties in the sluggard's path; but here, viewed in connection with the following hemistich, the thorns and snares refer to the hindrances proceeding from the froward, which injuriously affect others; \"thorns\" being a figure of the pains and troubles, \"snares\" of the unexpected dangers and impediments which evil men cause as they go on their crooked way. The word for \"thorns\" is צנִּים, which occurs in Job 5:5. The plant is supposed to be the Rhamnus paliurus, but it has not been accurately identified. He that doth keep his soul shall be far from them (comp. Proverbs 13:3; Proverbs 16:17). The man who has regard to his life and morals will go far, will keep wholly aloof, from those perils and traps into which the perverse try to entice them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Train up a child in the way he should go. The verb translated \"train\" (chanak) means, first, \"to put something into the mouth,\" \"to give to be tasted,\" as nurses give to infants food which they have masticated in order to prepare it for their nurslings; thence it comes to signify \"to give elementary instruction,\" \"to imbue,\" \"to train.\" The Hebrew literally is, Initiate a child in accordance with his way. The Authorized Version, with which Ewald agrees, takes the maxim to mean that the child should be trained from the first in the right path - the path of obedience and religion. This is a very true and valuable rule, but it is not what the author intends. \"His way\" must mean one of two things - either his future calling and station, or his character and natural inclination and capacity. Delitzsch and Plumptre take the latter interpretation; Nowack and Bertheau the former, on the ground that derek is not used in the other sense suggested. But, as far as use is concerned, both explanations stand on much the same ground; and it seems more in conformity with the moralist's age and nation to see in the maxim an injunction to consider the child's nature, faculties, and temperament, in the education which is given to him. If, from his early years, a child is thus trained, when he is old, he will not depart from it. This way, this education in accordance with his idiosyncrasy, will bear fruit all his life long; it will become a second nature, and will never be obliterated. The Vulgate commences the verse with Proverbium est, taking the first word substantively, as if the author here cited a trite saying; but the rendering is a mistake. There are similar maxims, common at all times and in all countries. Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:272 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Adeo in teneris consuescere multum est.\" Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:2, 67 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nunc adbibe puroNEWLINEPectore verba, puer.\" For, as he proceeds -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odoremNEWLINETesta diu.\" Thus we have two mediaeval jingles -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Cui puer assuescit, major dimittere nescit.\"NEWLINE\"Quod nova testa capit, inveterata sapit.\" Then there is the German saw, \"Jung gewohnt, alt gethan.\" \"What youth learns, age does not forget,\" says the Danish proverb. In another and a sad sense the French exclaim, \"St jeunesse savait! si vieillesse pouvait!\" All the early manuscripts of the Septuagint omit this verse; m some of the later it has been supplied from Theodotion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The rich ruleth over the poor. \"The rich man (singular) will rule over the poor\" (plural); for there are many poor for one rich (see on ver. 3). This is the way of the world (Proverbs 18:23). Aben Ezra explains the gnome as showing the advantage of wealth and the inconvenience of poverty; the former bringing power and pre-eminence, the latter trouble and servitude; and hence the moralist implies that every one should strive and labour to obtain a competency, and thus avoid the evils of impecuniosity. The borrower is servant to the lender. (For the relation between borrower and louder, or debtor and creditor, see on Proverbs 20:16; and comp. Matthew 18:25, 34.) Delitzsch cites the German saying, \"Borghart (borrower) is Lehnhart's (leader's) servant.\" We have the proverb, \"He that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing.\" The Septuagint departs from the other versions and our Hebrew text, translating, \"The rich will role over the poor, and household servants will lend to their own masters\" - a reading on which some of the Fathers have commented.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity; shall gain nothing substantial, shall have nothing to show for his pains. But aven also means \"calamity,\" \"trouble,\" as Proverbs 12:21; so the gnome expresses the truth that they who do evil shall meet with punishment in their very sins - the exact contrast to the promise to the righteous (Proverbs 11:18). \"To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.\" Thus we have in Job 4:8, \"They that plough iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same;\" and the apostle asserts (Galatians 6:7, etc), \"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.\" Eastern proverbs run, \"As the sin, so the atonement:\" \"Those who sow thorns can only reap prickles\" (comp. Proverbs 12:14). And the rod of his anger shall fail. The writer is thinking especially of cruelty and injustice practised on a neighbour, as Delitzsch has pointed out, and he means that the rod which he has raised, the violence intended against the innocent victim, shall vanish away or fall harmlessly. Ewald and others think that the rod is the Divine anger, and translate the verb (kalah) \"is prepared,\" a sense which here it will not well bear, though the LXX. has lent some countenance to it by rendering, \"And shall fully accomplish the plague (πληγὴν,? 'punishment') of his deeds.\" The rendering, \"shall fail.\" \"shall be consumed, or annihilated,\" is confirmed by Genesis 21:15; Isaiah 1:28; Isaiah 16:4, etc. The Septuagint adds a distich here, of which the first member is a variant of ver. 9a. and the second another rendering of the latter hemistich of the present verse: \"A cheerful man and a giver God blesseth (ἄνδρα ἱλαρὸν καὶ δότην εὐλογεῖ ὁ Θεός): but he shall bring to an end (συντελεσεῖ) the vanity of his works.\" The first hemistich is remarkable for being quoted by St. Paul (2 Corinthians 9:7), with a slight variation, Ἱλαρὸν γὰρ δότην ἀγαπᾷ ὁ Θεός. So Ecclus. 32 (35):9, \"In all thy gifts show a cheerful countenance (ἱλάρωσον τὸ πρόσθπόν σου).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed. The \"good of eye\" is the kindly looking, the benevolent man, in contrast to him of the evil eye, the envious, the unfriendly and niggardly man (Proverbs 23:6; Proverbs 28:22). St. Jerome renders, Qui pronus est ad misericordiam. Such a one is blessed by God in this world and the next, in time and in eternity, according to the sentiment of Proverbs 11:25. Thus in the temporal sense (Ecclus. 34 (31):23). \"Him that is liberal in food lips shall bless, and the testimony of his liberality will be believed.\" Septuagint, \"He that hath pity upon the poor shall himself be continually sustained (διατραφήσεται).\" The reason is added, For he giveth of his brans to the poor. The blessing is the consequence of his charity and liberality. 2 Corinthians 9:6, \"He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully (ἐπ αὐλογίαις).\" The Vulgate and Septuagint add a distich not in the Hebrew, Victoriam et honorem acquiret qui dat munera; animam autem aufert accipientium; Νίκην καὶ τιμὴν περι ποιεῖται ὁ δῶρα δοὺς τὴν μέντοι ψυχὴν ἀφαι ρεῖται τῶν κεκτημένωνω, \"Victory and honour he obtaineth who giveth gifts; but he takes away the life of the possessors.\" The first hemistich appears to be a variant of Proverbs 19:6b, the second to be derived from Proverbs 1:19b. The second portion of the Latin addition may mean that the liberal man wins and carries away with him the souls of the recipients of his bounty. But this, though Ewald would fain have it so, cannot be the signification of the corresponding Greek, which seems to mean that the man who is so liberal in distributing gifts obtains the power to do so by oppressing and wronging others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10 - Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; Septuagint, ἔκβαλε ἐκ συνεδρίου λοιμόν, \"Cast out of the company a pestilent fellow\" Chase away the scorner (Proverbs 1:22), the man who has no respect for things human or Divine, and the disputes and ill feeling which he caused will be ended; for \"where no wood is, the fire goeth out\" (Proverbs 26:20). Yea, strife and reproach shall cease. The reproach and ignominy (קָלון, kalon) are those which the presence and words of the scorner bring with them; to have such a one in the company is a disgrace to all good men. Thus Ishmael and his mother were driven from Abraham's dwelling (Genesis 21:9, etc.), and the apostle quotes (Galatians 4:30), \"Cast out (ἔκβαλε) the bondwoman and her son.\" Septuagint, \"For when he sits in the company he dishonours all.\" The next verse gives a happy contrast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He that loveth pureness of heart; he who strives to be pure m heart (Matthew 5:8), free from guile, lust, cupidity, vice of every kind. The next clause carries on the description of the perfect character, and is best translated. And hath grace of lips, the king is his friend. He who is not only virtuous and upright, but has the gift of graciousness of speech, winning manner in conversation, such a man wilt attach the king to him by the closest bonds of friendship. We have had something very similar at ch. 16:13. Some of the versions consider that by the king God is meant. Thus the Septuagint, \"The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all blameless persons are acceptable with him.\" The rest of the clause is connected by the LXX. with the following verse, \"A king guides his flock (ποιμαίνει) with his lips; but the eyes of the Lord,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge. The expression, \"preserve knowledge,\" is found at Proverbs 5:2 (where see note) in the sense of \"keep,\" \"retain,\" and, taken by itself, it might here signify that the Lord alone possesses knowledge, and alone imparts it to his servants (1 Samuel 2:3); but as in the following clause a person, the transgressor, is spoken of, it is natural to expect a similar expression in the former. The Revised Version is correct in rendering the abstract \"knowledge\" by the concrete \"him that hath knowledge;\" so that the clause says that God watches over and protects the man who knows him and walks in his ways, and uses his means and abilities for the good of others (see Proverbs 11:9). But he (the Lord) overthroweth the words of the transgressor. The transgressor here is the false, treacherous, perfidious man; and the gnome asserts that God frustrates by turning in another direction the outspoken intentions of this man, which he had planned against the righteous (comp. Proverbs 13:6; Proverbs 21:12). Septuagint, \"But the eves of the Lord preserve knowledge, but the transgressor despiseth words,\" i e. commands, or words of wisdom and warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The slothful man saith, There is a lion without (Proverbs 26:13). The absurd nature of the sluggard's excuse is hardly understood by the casual reader. The supposed lion is without, in the open country, and yet he professes to be in danger in the midst of the town. I shall be slain in the streets. Others consider that the sluggard makes two excuses for his inactivity. If work calls him abroad, he may meet the lion which report says is prowling in the neighbourhood; if he has to go into the streets, he may be attacked and murdered by ruffians for motives of plunder or revenge. \"Sluggards are prophets,\" says the Hebrew proverb. Septuagint, \"The sluggard maketh excuses, and saith, A lion is in the ways, there are murderers in the streets.\" Lions, though now extinct in Palestine, seem to have lingered till the time of the Crusades, and such of them as became man eaters, the old or feeble, were a real danger in the vicinity of villages (comp. Jeremiah 49:19; Jeremiah 50:44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The mouth of strange women is a deep pit. The hemistich reappears in a slightly altered form at Proverbs 23:27. (For \"strange woman\" as equivalent to \"a harlot\" or \"adulteress,\" see note on Proverbs 2:16.) By her \"mouth\" is meant her wanton, seductive words, which entice a man to destruction of body and soul. It may be that theology rather than morals is signified here - rather false doctrines than evil practice. In this case the mention of the strange or foreign woman is very appropriate, seeing that perversions of belief and worship were always introduced into Israel from external sources. He that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein. He who has incurred the width of God by previous unfaithfulness and sin is left to himself to fall a prey to the allurements of the wicked woman (comp. Ecclesiastes 7:26). Septuagint, \"The mouth of a transgressor (παρανόμου) is a deep ditch; and he that is hated of the Lord shall fall therein.\" Then are added three lines not in the Hebrew, which, however, seem to be reminiscences of other passages: \"There are evil ways before a man, and be loveth not to turn away from them; but it is needful to turn away item a perverse and evil way.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFoolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child. Foolishness (ivveleth) here implies the love of mischief, the waywardness and self-will, belonging to children, bound up in their very nature. Septuagint, \"Folly is attached (ἐξῆπται) to the heart of the young,\" in which version Cornelius a Lapide sees an allusion to the ornament hung by fond parents round the neck of a child whom they were inclined to spoil rather than to train in self-denying ways. To such a child folly adheres as closely as the bulla with which he is decorated. But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. Judicious education overcomes this natural tendency, by punishing it when exhibited, and imparting wisdom and piety (see on Proverbs 13:24 and Proverbs 19:18; and comp. Proverbs 23:13; Proverbs 29:15; Ecclus. 30:1, etc). The LXX. pursue their notion of the the indulgent parents letting the child have his own way, for they render the last clause, \"But the rod and discipline are far from him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches (so the Vulgate), and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. There are various renderings and explanations of this verse. The Authorized Version says that he who oppresseth the poor to enrich himself, and he who wastes his means by giving to those who do not need it, will come to poverty. But the antithesis of this distich is thus lost. The Hebrew literally rendered brings out the contrast, Whosoever oppresseth the poor, it is for his gain; whosoever giveth to the rich, it is for his loss. Delitzsch explains the sentence thus: \"He who enriches himself by extortion from the poor, at any rate gains what he desires; but he who gives to the rich impoverishes himself in vain, has no thanks, reaps only disappointment.\" One cannot but feel that the maxim thus interpreted is poor and unsatisfactory. The interpretation in the 'Speaker's Commentary' is more plausible: The oppressor of the poor will himself suffer in a similar mode, and will have to surrender his ill-gotten gains to some equally unscrupulous rich man. But the terse antithesis of the original is wholly obscured by this view of the distich. It is far better, with Hitzig, Ewald, and others, to take the gain in the first hemistich as that of the poor man, equivalent to \"doth but bring him gain;\" though the sentence is not necessarily to be explained as suggesting that the injustice which the poor man suffers at the hand of his wealthy neighbour is a stimulus to him to exert himself in order to better his position, and thus indirectly tends to his enrichment. The maxim is really conceived in the religious style of so many of these apparently worldly pronouncements, and states a truth in the moral government of God intimated elsewhere, e.g. Proverbs 13:22; Proverbs 28:8; and that truth is that the riches extorted from the poor man will in the end redound to his benefit, that by God's providential control the oppression and injustice from which he has suffered shall work to his good. In the second hemistich the loss is that of the rich man. By adding to the wealth of the rich the donor increases his indolence, encourages his luxury, vice, and extravagance, and thus leads to his ruin - \"bringeth only to want. Septuagint, \"He that calumniates (συκοφαντῶν) the poor increaseth his own substance, but giveth to the rich at a loss (ἐπ ἐλάσσονι)\" i.e. so as to lessen his substance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17-ch. 24:22. - Part IV. FIRST APPENDIX TO THE FIRST GREAT COLLECTION, containing \"words of the wise.\" Verses 17-21. - The introduction to this first appendix, containing an exhortation to attend to the words of the wise, an outline of the instruction herein imparted, with a reference to teaching already given. Verse 17. - Incline thine ear (comp. Proverbs 4:20; Proverbs 5:1). The words of the wise; verba sapientium, Vulgate. \"Wise\" is in the plural number, showing that this is not a portion of the collection called, 'The Proverbs of Solomon' (Proverbs 10:1), but a distinct work. (For the term, see note on Proverbs 1:6.) My knowledge. The knowledge which I impart by bringing to notice these sayings of wise men. Septuagint, \"Incline (παράβαλλε) thine ear to the words of wise men, and hear my word, and apply thine heart, that thou mayest know that they are good.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - This verse gives the reason for the previous exhortation. It is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; in thy mind and memory (comp. Proverbs 18:8; Proverbs 20:27). Thus Psalm 147:1, \"It is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely.\" They shall withal be fitted in thy lips. This rendering hardly suits the hortatory nature of the introduction. It is better to take the clause in the optative, as Delitzsch, Ewald, Nowack, and ethers: \"Let them abide altogether upon thy lips;\" i.e. be not ashamed to profess them openly, let them regulate thy words, teach thee wisdom and discretion. Septuagint, \"And if thou admit them to thy heart, they shall likewise gladden thee on thy lips.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - That thy trust may be in the Lord. The Greek and Latin versions make this clause depend on the preceding verse. It is better to consider it as dependent on the second hemistich, the fact of instruction being placed after the statement of its object. All the instruction herein afforded is meant to teach that entire confidence in the Lord which, as soon as his will is known and understood, leads a man to do it at any cost or pains, leaving the result in God's hands. I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee. The repetition of the personal pronoun brings home the teaching to the disciple, and shows that it is addressed, not merely to the mass of men, but to each individual among them, who thus becomes responsible for the use which he makes of it (comp. Proverbs 23:15). The expression, \"this day,\" further emphasizes the exhortation. The learner is not to remember vaguely that some time or other he received this instruction, but that on this particular day the warning was given. So in Hebrews 3:7, 13 we read, \"As the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.... Exhort one another daily, so long as it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.\" Septuagint, \"That thy hope may be in the Lord, and he may make thy way known unto thee.\" Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') quotes Biekell's correction of this verse, \"That thy confidence may be in Jehovah, to make known unto thee thy ways;\" but the alteration seems arbitrary and unnecessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge? There is a difficulty about the word tendered \"excellent things.\" The Khetib has שׁלשׁום, \"the day before yesterday, formerly;\" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, \"Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge,\" and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to \"this day\" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word τρισσῶς thus, \"And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart.\" St. Jerome has, Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis. Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to \"oftentimes,\" or \"in many forms.\" But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives שָׁלִשִׁים (shalishim), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by τριστὰτης e.g. Exodus 14:7; Exodus 15:4), which is equivalent to \"chieftain.\" Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - \"choice proverbs,\" as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives τρισμέγιστα. Thus we come back to the rendering of the Authorized Version as meet correct and intelligible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth. The object intended is to teach the disciple the fixed rule (firmitatem, Vulgate) by which truthful words are guided (see Luke 1:4). Septuagint, \"I therefore teach thee a true word and knowledge good to learn.\" That thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee. This implies that the pupil will be enabled to teach others who apply to him for instruction; \"will be ready.\" as St. Peter says, \"always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you\" (1 Peter 3:15). But the last expression is better translated, \"them that send thee;\" illis qui miserunt te, Vulgate (see Proverbs 25:13); and we must conceive of these as being parents or tutors who send a youth to a school or wise man to be educated. The moralist expresses his desire that the disciple will carry home such wholesome, truthful doctrines as will prove that the pains expended upon him have not been useless. Septuagint, \"That thou mayest answer words of truth to those who put questions to thee (τοῖς προβαλλομένοις σοι)\" The Syriac adds, \"That I may make known unto thee counsel and wisdom.\" Bickell's version (quoted by Cheyne) is, \"That thou mayest know the rightness of these words, that thou mayest answer in true words to them that ask thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22-ch. 24:22. - Here commence the \"words of the wise.\" Verse 22. - This and the following verse form a terrastich, which connects itself in thought with ver. 16. Rob not the poor, because he is poor. The word for \"poor\" is here dal, which means \"feeble,\" \"powerless\" (see on Proverbs 19:4), and the writer enjoins the disciple not to be induced by his weakness to injure and despoil a poor man. Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate. The gate is the place of judgment, the court of justice (comp. Job 31:21). The warning points to the particular form of wrong inflicted on the lowly by unjust judges, who could give sentences from which, however iniquitous, there was practically no appeal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For, though they are powerless to defend themselves, and have no earthly patrons, the Lord will plead their cause (Proverbs 23:11). Jehovah will be their Advocate and Protector. And spoil the soul of those that spoiled them; rather, despoil of life those that despoil them. So the Revised Version. God, exercising his moral government on human concerns, will bring ruin and death on the unjust judge or the rich oppressor of the poor. Jerome has, Configet eos qui confixerunt animam ejus. The verb used is קבע (kabah), which is found only here and Malachi 3:8, where it means \"to defraud\" or \"despoil.\" In the Chaldee and Syriac it may signify \"to fix,\" \"to pierce.\" Septuagint, \"The Lord will judge his cause, and thou shalt deliver thy soul unharmed (ἄσυλον):\" i.e. if you refrain from injustice and oppression, you will be saved Item evil and dwell securely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - Another tetrastich. Make no friendship with an angry (irascible) man. Have no close intercourse with a man given to fits of passion. And with a furious man thou shalt not go. Avoid the society of such a one. The reason follows: Lest thou learn his ways; his manner of life and conduct. as Proverbs 1:15 (where see note). Anger breeds anger; impotence, impatience. St. Basil ('De Ira'), quoted by Corn. a Lapide, enjoins, \"Take not your adversary as your teacher, and be not a mirror to reflect the angry man, showing his figure in thyself.\" And get a snare to thy soul; bring destruction on thyself. Anger unsubdued not only mars the kindliness of social life, but leads to all sorts of dangerous complications which may bring ruin and death in their train (comp. Proverbs 15:18). Vers 26, 27. - A warning against suretyship, often repeated. Be not thou one of them that strike hands; i.e. that become guarantees for others (see on Proverbs 17:18; 20:16; and comp. Proverbs 6:1; Proverbs 11:15). Sureties for debts. The writer explains what kind of guarantee he means. Why should he (the creditor) take away thy bed from under thee? Why should you (\"from respect of person.\" Septuagint) act so weakly as to give a creditor power to seize your very bed as a pledge? The Law endeavoured to mitigate this penalty (Exodus 22:26, 27; Deuteronomy 24:12, 13). But doubtless its merciful provisions were evaded by the moneylenders (see Nehemiah 5:11; Ezekiel 18:12, \"hath not restored the pledge\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The first line is repeated at Proverbs 23:10. (On the sanctity of landmarks, see note on Proverbs 15:25.) Some of the stones, exhibiting a bilingual inscription, which marked the boundaries of the Levitical city of Gezer, were discovered by Gauneau in 1874 ('Quart. Statement Pal. Explor. Fund,' 1874). The Septuagint calls the landmarks ὅρια αἰώνια.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29 - A tristich follows. Seest thou a man diligent in his business! Mere diligence would not commend a man to high notice unless accompanied by dexterity and skill; and though מָהִיר (mahir) means \"quick,\" it also has the notion of \"skilful,\" and is better here taken in that sense. He shall stand before kings. This phrase means to serve or minister to another (Genesis 41:46; 1 Samuel 16:21, 22; 1 Kings 10:8; Job 1:6). A man thus export is fitted for any, even the highest situation, may well be employed in affairs of state, and enjoy the confidence of kings. He shall not stand before mean men. \"Mean\" (חְשֻׁכִּים) are the men of no importance, ignobiles, obscure. An intellectual, clever, adroit man would never he satisfied with serving such masters; his ambition is higher; he knows that he is capable of better things. Septuagint, \"It must needs be that an observant (ὁρατικὸν) man, and one who is keen in his business, should attend on kings, and not attend on slothful men.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - A hexastich closely connected with the last verse of the preceding chapter, as if the warning was addressed to the man of skill whom his talents had made the guest of kings. Verse 1. - When thou sittest to eat with a ruler. This, of course, would be a great honour to a man of lowly birth, or to one of the middle class, to whom the manners of courts and palaces were practically unknown. Consider diligently what is before thee. So the Vulgate, Qua apposita sunt ante faciem tuam; and the Septuagint, Τὰ παρατιθέμενά σοι. Take heed lest the unusual dainties on the table tempt thee to excess, which may lead not only to unseemly behaviour, but also to unruly speech, revealing of secrets, etc. But the latter words may also be tendered, \"him that is,\" or, \"who is before thee.\" And this gives a very appropriate sense. The guest is enjoined to fix his attention, not on the delicate food, but on the host, who is his superior, and able to exalt and to destroy him (compare the cautious maxims in Ecclus. 13:2, 6, 7, 11, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. \"Stab thy gluttony,\" Wordsworth. Restrain thyself by the strongest measures, convince thyself that thou art in the utmost peril, if thou art a glutton or wine bibber (Ecclus. 34 [31]:12). The LXX. gives a different turn to the injunction, \"And apply (ἐπίβαλλε) thy hand, knowing that it behoves thee to prepare such things.\" This is like the warning of Siracides, in the chapter quoted above, where the disciple is admonished not to attend the banquets of rich men, lest he should be tempted to vie with them, and thus ruin himself by attempting to return their civilities in the same lavish manner. The earlier commentators have used the above verses as a lesson concerning the due and reverent partaking of the Holy Communion, thus: \"When you approach the table of Christ, consider diligently what is represented by the elements before you, and have discernment and faith, lest you eat and drink unworthily; and after communicating walk warily, mortify all evil desires, live as in the presence of the Lord Jesus, the Giver of the feast.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Be not desirous of his dainties. (For \"dainties,\" see on ver. 6.) Be not too greedy of the bounties of the royal table, so as to forget discretion, and be led to say and do things which are inexpedient or unseemly. For they are deceitful meat. Oftentimes such entertainment is not offered for friendship's sake, but for some sinister purpose - to make a man expose himself, to get at a man's real character or secrets. Far from being a sign of favour and good will, the seeming honour is deceptive and dangerous. We all know Horace's lines, 'Ars Poet.,' 434, etc. -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Reges dicuntur multi, urgere culullisNEWLINEEt torquere mero, quem perspexisse laborant,NEWLINEAu sit amicitia dignus.\" Hitzig quotes the Eastern proverb, \"He who eats of the sultan's soup burns his lips, even though it he after a length of time.\" We have too the Indian saying, \"An epicure digs his grave with his teeth,\" which is true in more senses than one. \"Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill,\" says Siracides (Ecclus. 9:13); \"so shalt thou not be troubled with fear of death: and if thou come unto him, commit no fault, lest he presently take away thy life; remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city.\" Then for the reasons which induce a ruler to ply a guest with wine, we have, \"In vino veritas, quod est in corde sobrii, est in ore ebrii.\" Theognis writes -NEWLINENEWLINEἘν πυρὶ μὲν χρυσόν τε καὶ ἄργυρον ἴδριες ἄνδρεςNEWLINEΓιγνώσκους ἀνδρὸς δ οϊνος ἔδειξε νόονNEWLINEΚαὶ μάλα περ πινυτοῦ τὸν ὐπέρ μέτρον ἤρατο πίνωνNEWLINEΩστε καταισχῦναι καὶ πρὶν ἐόντα σοφόν.

John 6:27, \"Labour not for the meat that perisheth,\" where the warning is against that absorbing eagerness for wealth which leads to evil doing and neglect of all higher interests. Cease from thine own wisdom. The wisdom (binah, Proverbs 3:5) is that which is necessary for making and keeping wealth. Vulgate, Prudentiae tuae pone modum. This is not the highest form of wisdom (chochmah), but rather the faculty of distinguishing one thing from another, mere discernment, which may exist without any religious or keen moral sense (see note on Proverbs 16:16, where possibly the contrast is expressed). Talmud, \"He who augments his riches augments his cares.\" Erasmus, 'Adag,,' quotes or writes -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Jupiter ementitur opes mortalibus ipse,NEWLINESic visum ut fuerit, cuicunque, bonove, malove?

Why cast longing looks towards this wealth, and so prepare for yourself loss and disappointment? The pursuit is vain, and the result is never secure; what you gained by long toil and prudent care may be lost in an hour. Do you wish to incur this danger? Wordsworth quotes Persius, 'Sat.,' 3:61 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"An passim sequeris corvos testaque lutoque?\" For riches certainly make themselves wings. The subject, unexpressed, is riches, and the Hebrew phrase implies absolute certainty: Making they will make for themselves. They fly away as an eagle toward heaven; or, like on eagle that flieth toward heaven, where not even sight can follow. Publ. Syr., 255, \"Longinquum est omne quod cupiditas flagitat.\" The Telugu compares worldly prosperity to writing upon water.

Septuagint, ἀνδρὶ βασκάνῳ, the man who has the evil eye that fascinates, which, however, is a later idea; here the notion is rather of a grudging, sordid temper, that cannot bear the sight of others' happiness or prosperity (comp. Deuteronomy 15:9; Matthew 20:15). Ecclus. 16:8, Πονηρὸς ὁ βασκαίνων ὀφθαλμῳ, \"The envious man hath an evil eye; he turneth away his face, and he is one who despiseth men.\" Dainty meats; as in ver. 3.

The verb here used is שָׁעַר (shaar), \"to estimate, ....to calculate,\" and the clause is best rendered, For as one that calculates with himself, so is he. The meaning is that this niggardly host watches every morsel which his guest eats, and grudges what he appears to offer so liberally. In the Authorized Version the word \"heart\" occurs twice in this verse, but the Hebrew words are different. The first is nephesh, \"breath,\" equivalent to \"mind;\" the second is leb, \"heart.\" The Vulgate paraphrases the clause, Quoniam in similitudinem arioli et conjectoris, aestimat quod ignorat, \"For like a soothsayer or diviner he conjectures that of which he is ignorant.\" Eat and drink, saith he to thee. He professes to make you welcome, and with seeming cordiality invites you to partake of the food upon his table. But his heart is not with thee. He is not glad to see you enjoy yourself, and his pressing invitation is empty verbiage with no heart in it. The Septuagint, pointing differently, translates, \"For as if one should swallow a hair, so he eats and drinks.\" The Greek translators take the gnome to apply to one who invites an envious man to his table, and finds him eating his food as if it disgusted him. They go on, \"Bring him not in to thee, nor eat thy morsel with him; for (ver. 8) he will vomit it up, and outrage thy fair words.\" In agreement with the gnome above, we find in the Talmud, \"My son, eat not the bread of the covetous, nor sit thou at his table. The bread of the covetous is only pain and anguish; the bread of the generous man is a source of health and joy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The morsel which thou hast eaten shall thou vomit up. Food thus grudgingly bestowed will only create disgust, and do thee no good; thou wilt feel annoyed to have eaten it, and wilt long to get rid of it. And lose thy sweet words. You will have expended in vain your civil speeches and thanks for the entertainment provided for you; you really owe no gratitude for fare so grudgingly bestowed. Some think that by the \"sweet words\" are meant the conversation at table with which you have endeavoured to amuse your host - the witty sayings, enigmas, and apothegms, which entered so largely into the programme of a good talker. All such efforts are thrown away on the jealous, morose host. But the former explanation is more agreeable to the context.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Here is another case in which \"sweet words\" are lost. Speak not in the ears of a fool. This does not mean, as it would in our English phrase - whisper not to a fool; but do not take the trouble to try to make him understand, impart nothing to him. The \"fool\" here (kesil) is the dull, stolid, stupid man. who cannot be moved from his own narrow groove (see on Proverbs 1:22). It is a mere casting of pearls before swine (Matthew 7:6) to speak to such a man of high aims, righteous motives, self-sacrifice (comp. Proverbs 9:8). He will despise the wisdom of thy words. He cannot enter into the meaning of words of wisdom; he has no appetite for them, he cannot assimilate them; and in his self-satisfied dulness he feels for them nothing but contempt (Ecclus. 22:7, etc., \"Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep. He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: whey he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter?\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - An enlargement of Proverbs 22:28 combined with Proverbs 22:22, 28. Verse 10. - Enter not into the fields of the fatherless. Do not think to appropriate the fields of orphans, as if there were no our to defend their rights (comp. Proverbs 15:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For their Redeemer is mighty. The redeemer (goel) is the near kinsman, who had to avenge bloodshed, carry on the blood feud, or vindicate the cause of a relation otherwise unsupported (see Numbers 25:12, 19, 21; Leviticus 25:25; Ruth 3:2, 9, 12). God himself will be the orphans' Goel. This term is often applied to God; e.g. Job 19:25; Psalm 19:14; Jeremiah 50:34. He shall plead their cause with thee. He will, as it were, conduct their cause, try thee, convict thee of injustice, and pronounce thy condemnation (Proverbs 22:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTApply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12 commences a new series of proverbs of wisdom. This general admonition is addressed to all, tutor and disciple, educator and educated. Apply thine heart unto instruction. (For musar, \"instruction,\" see note on Proverbs 1:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - An injunction to the tutor or parent (comp. Proverbs 13:24; Proverbs 19:18; Proverbs 22:15; Proverbs 29:17). For if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. This has been understood in various senses; e.g. \"Though than scourge him, that correction will not kill him;....If thou chastise him, thou wilt save him from the doom of the rebellious son\" (Deuteronomy 21:18-21); or, \"He shall not die eternally,\" which rather anticipates the conclusion in the next verse. The expression merely means - Do not be weak, thinking that you will injure your child by judicious correction, and in this fear withholding your hand; but punish him firmly when necessary, and, far from harming him, you will be doing him the greatest good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Shalt deliver his soul from hell (sheol); de inferno, Vulgate; ἐκ θανάτου, Septuagint. Premature death was regarded as a punishment of sin, as long life was the reward of righteousness. Proper discipline preserves a youth not only from many material dangers incident to unbridled passions, but saves him from spiritual death, the decay and destruction of grace here, and the retribution that awaits the sinner in another world (comp. Ecclus, 30:1-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The moralist now addresses the disciple, and so to the end of the chapter. If thine heart be wise; become wise by profiting by discipline, and having its natural folly (Proverbs 22:15) eradicated. My heart shall rejoice, even mine. The pronoun is repeated for the sake of emphasis (as in Proverbs 22:19), the speaker thus declaring his supreme interest in the moral progress of his pupil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - My reins shall rejoice. The \"reins\" (kelayoth), kidneys, are regarded as the seat of feeling and sensation (Job 19:27). or of the inner nature generally (Psalm 16:7; Revelation 2:22). I shall rejoice in my very soul when thy lips speak right things; i.e. when thy heart is so replete with wisdom, thy mind so well instructed as to utter naught but what is true and sensible (Proverbs 8:6). The composition of these two verses is noteworthy, 15a being parallel to 16b, and. 15b to 16a. Septuagint, \"And thy lips shall linger in words (ἐνδιατρίψει λόγοις) with my lips, if they be right,\" which seems to mean, \"If thy lips utter what is right, they will gather wisdom from my words and impart it to others.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let not thine heart envy sinners, when thou seest them apparently happy and prosperous (comp. Proverbs 3:31; Proverbs 24:1, 19; Psalm 37:1; Psalm 73:3). The Authorized Version, in agreement with the Septuagint, Vulgate, Arabic, and other versions, takes the second clause of this verse as an independent one: but it seems evidently to be constructionally connected with the preceding, and to be governed by the same verb, so that there is no occasion to insert \"be thou.\" But be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long. Jerome, corrected, would read, Non aemuletur cor tuum peccatores, sed timorem Domini tota die, As Delitzsch and Hitzig, followed by Nowack, have pointed out, the Hebrew verb, קָנָא (kana), is here used in two senses. In the first clause it signifies to be envious of a person: in the second, to be zealous for a thing, both senses combining in the thought of being moved with eager desire. Ζηλοτυπέω is used in this double sense, and aemulor in Latin. So the gnome comes to this - Show your heart's desire, not by envy of the sinner's fortune, but by zeal for true religion, that fear of the Lord which leads to strict obedience and earnest desire to please him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For surely there is an end. PGBR> Some take the hemistich conditionally, rendering אִם \"when,\" or \"if the end comes;\" but cue sees no object in the thought being expressed conditionally; and it is best. with the Authorized Version, Nowack, and others, to take כִּי אִם equivalent to \"assuredly,\" as in Judges 15:7; 2 Samuel 15:21. \"End\" (acharith) is the glorious future that awaits the pious (Proverbs 24:14; Jeremiah 29:11). The prosperity of simmers is not to be envied, for it is transitory and deceptive; but for the righteous, however depressed at times there is a happy end in prospect. And thine expectation (hope) shall not be cut off. The hope of comfort here and reward hereafter shall be abundantly realized. The writer has a firm belief in the moral government of God, and in a future life which shall rectify all anomalies (comp. Proverbs 14:32; Wisd. 5:15, etc.; Ecclus. 1:13). Septuagint, \"For if thou keep them, thou shalt haw posterity, and thy hope shall not be removed\" (Psalm 37:9; Job 42:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-21. - An exhortation to temperance, as one of the results of the fear of God, prefaced by an exhortation to wisdom. Verse 19. - Hear thou. The pronoun gives force and personality to the injunction (Job 33:33). Guide thine heart in the way. (For אשׁר, \"to guide straight,\" see on Proverbs 4:14) \"The way\" is the right way, in distinction to the many wrong paths of life - the way of understanding, as it is called (Proverbs 9:6). Septuagint, \"Direct aright the thoughts of thy heart,\" for right thoughts lead to right actions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Wine bibbers; persons who meet together for the express purpose of drinking intoxicating liquors. Among riotous eaters of flesh. The Hebrew is \"of flesh for themselves,\" whence some take the meaning to be \"of their own flesh,\" i.e. who by their gluttony and luxury ruin their own bodies. But the parallelism with the wine drinker shows plainly that the flesh which they eat is meant, and the idea is that they eat for the gratification of their own appetites, caring nothing for anything else. The combination of glutton and wine bibber was used as a reproach against our blessed Lord (Matthew 11:19). The versions of Jerome and the LXX. point to the contributed entertainments, where each guest brought some article to the meal, like our picnics. Thus Vulgate, \"Be not among parties of drinkers, nor at the banquets of those who contribute flesh to eat;\" Septuagint. \"Be not a wine bibber, and strain not after contributed feasts (συμβολαῖς) and purchases of meats.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Intemperance leads to prodigality, carelessness, and ruin. And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. The luxury and excess spoken of above lead to drowsiness and inability to work, and poverty follows as the natural result (comp. Proverbs 19:15; Proverbs 24:33, etc.). The Vulgate still harps on the same string as in the previous verse, \"Those who waste time in drinking, and who give picnics (dantes symbola), shall be ruined, and semnolence small clothe with rags.\" The LXX. introduces a new idea which the Hebrew does not warrant, \"For every drunkard and whoremonger shall be poor, and every sluggard shall clothe himself with tatters and rags.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-25. - An octastich, containing an earnest exhortation to the disciple. Verse 22. - That begat thee. This is a claim on the attention and obedience of the son. When she is old. When old age with its consequent infirmities comes upon thy mother, despise her not, but rather thank God for giving her long life, and profit by her love and long experience (comp. Ecclus. 3:1, etc., where the exhortation to honour parents is very full and touching).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBuy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Buy the truth, and sell it not (comp. Proverbs 4:5, 7; Proverbs 16:16). Consider truth as a thing of the highest value, and spare no pains, cost, or sacrifice to obtain it, and, when gotten, keep it safe; do not barter it for earthly profit or the pleasures of sense; do not be reasoned out of it, or laughed out of it; \"sell it not,\" do not part with it for any consideration. The second clause gives the sphere in which truth moves, or the three properties which appertain to it. These are: wisdom (chochmah), practical knowledge; instruction (musar), moral culture and discipline; and understanding (binah), the faculty of discernment (see notes on Proverbs 1:2). This verse is omitted in the chief manuscripts of the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice. The father of a righteous son who has won truth and profited by the possession has good cause to be glad (Proverbs 10:1). Septuagint erroneously, \"A righteous father brings up children well.\" The second clause repeats the first in different words, with the further idea that the wise son affords his father practical proof of the excellence of his moral training. The contrast is seen in Proverbs 17:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Shall be glad; or, let them be glad; gaudeat, Vulgate; εὐφραινέσθω, Septuagint. She that bare thee. As in ver. 24 the father's joy was expressly mentioned, so here prominence is given to that of the mother. In the former case it is \"he that begetteth;\" here, \"she that beareth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-28. - A hexastich, in which Wisdom herself is the speaker, and warns against unchastity. Verse 26. - Give me thine heart. Do not waste thy powers and affections on evil objects, but set thy soul with all its best faculties on me, Wisdom, who alone can satisfy its desires and aspirations. There is an eloquent passage in a tract that has gone by St. Bernard's name, though not written by him ('Epist. de Reg. Vitae Spirit.,' 2:1604, Mab.), which is worth quoting: \"Cor nostrum nihil dignius perficere potest, quam ut ei se restituat a quo factum est: et hoc a nobis Dominus expetit dicens, 'Fili, da mihi cor tuum.' Tunc siquidem cor hominum Deo datur, quando omnia cogitatio terminatur in eum, gyrat et circumflectitur super eum, et nihil vult possidere praeter eum. Sicque colligato sibi animo, eum diligit, ut sine ipso amarus sit omnis amor. Nec aliud dixerim cor Domino dare, quam ipsum captivare in omni obsequium ejus, et ita voluntati ejus ex toto supponere, ut nihil aliud velit, quam quod noverit eum velle.\" Let thine eyes observe my ways; keep closely to the paths of virtue which I teach thee, especially the path of purity, as the next verse shows. Vulgate, Vias meas custodiant; Septuagint, Ἐμὰς ὁδοὺς πήρειτωσαν. This is the reading of the Keri, תִּלֺצרְנָה; the Khetib, which Delitzsch and others prefer, reads תִּרְצֶנָה, \"delight in\" my ways.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The need of the emphatic injunction in ver. 26 is exemplified by the dangers of impurity. A deep ditch; as Proverbs 22:14. A strange woman is a narrow pit. (For \"strange woman,\" equivalent to \"harlot,\" see on Proverbs 2:16.) A narrow pit is one with a narrow month, from which, if one falls into it, it is difficult to extricate one's self. The verse indicates the seductive nature of the vice of unchastity: how easy it is to be led into it! how difficult to rise from it! Thus St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 11, in 1 Corinthians'), \"When by unclean desire the soul is made captive, even as a cloud and mist darken the eyes of the body, so that desire intercepts the foresight of the mind, and suffers no one to see any distance before him, either precipice, or hell, or fear; but thenceforth, having that deceit as a tyrant over him, he comes to be easily vanquished by sin; and there is raised up before his eyes as it were a partition wall, and no windows in it, which suffers not the ray of righteousness to shine in upon the mind, the absurd conceits of lust enclosing it as with a rampart on all sides. And then, and from that time forward, the unchaste woman is everywhere meeting him - before his eyes, before his mind, before his thoughts, in station and presence. And as the blind, although they stand at high noon beneath the very central point of the heaven, receive not the light, their eyes being fast closed up; just so these also, though ten thousand doctrines of salvation sound in their ears from all quarters, having their soul preoccupied with this passion, stop their ears against all discourses of that kind. And they know it well who have made the trial. But God forbid that you should know it from actual experience!\" The LXX. has changed the allusion: \"For a strange house is a pierced wine jar (πίθος τετρημένος), and a strange well is narrow,\" where the idea seems to be that the private well, which is dug for the convenience of one family only, is not to be relied upon, and will yield not enough to supply others' wants. Hence would arise a warning against coveting a neighbour's wife. There is a Greek proverb about drawing wine into pierced jars (Xen., 'OEcon.,' 7:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - She also lieth in wait as for a prey. \"Yea, she [Proverbs 22:19] lieth in wait,\" as is graphically described in ch. 7. (comp. Jeremiah 3:2). Chetheph is better taken, not as \"prey,\" but in a concrete sense as the person who snatches it, the robber. Vulgate, Insidiatur in via quasi latro (comp. Psalm 10:9). And increaseth the transgressors among men. The Greek and Latin versions have taken רוסִיפ as meaning \"kills,\" \"destroys.\" But the verb yasaph always means \"to add,\" here \"to multiply.\" The special transgression indicated is treachery or faithlessness. The harlot leads her victim to be faithless to his God, his wife, his parents, his tutor, his master. Septuagint, \"For he shall perish suddenly, and every transgressor shall be destroyed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-35. - Here follows a mashal ode or song on the subject of drunkenness, which is closely connected with the sin mentioned in the previous lines. Verse 29. - Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? Hebrew, lemi oi, lemi aboi, where oi and aboi are interjections of pain or grief. So Venetian, τίνι αι} τίνι φεῦ; Revised Version margin, Who hath Oh? who hath Alas? The Vulgate has stumbled at the second expression, which is an ἄπαξ λεγόμενον, and resolving it into two words, translates, Cujus patri vae? Contentions; the brawling and strife to which drunkenness leads (Proverbs 20:1). Babbling; שִׂיחַ (siach) is rather \"meditation,\" \"sorrowful thought\" showing itself in complaining, regret for lost fortune, ruined health, alienated friends. Others render \"misery,....penury.\" St. Jerome's foveae is derived from a different reading. The LXX. has κρίσεις, \"lawsuits,\" ἀηδίαι καὶ λέσχαι, \"disgust and gossipings.\" Wounds without cause; wounds which might have been avoided, the result of quarrels in which a sober man would never have engaged, Redness of eyes. The Hebrew word chakIi-luth is commonly taken to mean the flashing of eyes occasioned by vinous excitement. The Authorized Version refers it to the bloodshot appearance of a drunkard's eyes, as in Genesis 49:12, according to the same version. but Delitzsch, Nowack, and many modern commentators consider that the word indicates \"dimness of sight,\" that change in the power of vision when the stimulant reaches the brain. Septuagint, \"Whose eyes are livid (πελιδνοί)?\" The effects of intemperance are described in a well known passage of Lucretius, 'De Rer. Nat.,' 3:475, etc. -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Denique, cor hominum quota vini vis penetravitNEWLINEAcris, et in venas discessit diditus ardor,NEWLINEConsequitur gravitas membrorum, praespediunturNEWLINECrura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens,NEWLINENant oculei; clamor, singultus, jurgia gliscunt.\" We may refer to the article in Jeremy Taylor's 'Holy Living' on \"Evil Consequents to Drunkenness,\" and to Ecclus. 34 (31):25, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The answer to the above searching questions is here given. They that tarry long at the wine (Isaiah 5:11), who sit till late hours drinking. They that go to seek mixed wine; i.e. go to the wine house, place of revelry, where they may taste and give their opinion upon \"mixed wine,\" mimsak, wine mingled with certain spices or aromatic substances, or else simply with water, as it was too luscious to be drunk undiluted (see on Proverbs 9:2). Septuagint, \"those who hunt out where carousals are taking place.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Look not thou upon the wine when it is red. Be not attracted by its beautiful appearance. The wine of Palestine was chiefly \"red,\" though what we call white wine was not unknown. The Vulgate flavescit points to the latter. When it giveth his colour in the cup. For \"color\" the Hebrew has \"eye,\" which refers to the sparkling and gleaming which show themselves in wine poured into the cup. It is as though the cup had an eye which glanced at the drinker with a fascination which he did not resist. When it moveth itself aright. Having warned against the attraction of sight, the moralist now passes to the seduction of taste. Hebrew, when it goeth by the right read. This may refer to its transference from the jar or skin to the drinking cup; but it mere probably alludes to the drinker's throat, and is best translated, \"when it glideth down smoothly.\" Vulgate, ingreditur blande. The wine pleases the palate, and passes over it without roughness or harshness (comp. Song of Solomon 7:9). The LXX. has enlarged on the original thus: \"Be ye not drunk with wine, but converse with just men, and converse in public places (ἐν περιπάτοις). For if thou set thine eyes on goblets and cups, afterwards thou shalt walk more bare than a pestle (γύμνοτερος ὐπέρου).\" This last expression, pistillo nudior, is a proverb. Regarding the danger of looking on seductive objects, the Arab, in his sententious language, says, \"The contemplation of vice is vice.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - At the last it biteth like a serpent. Wine is like the subtle poison of a serpent, which affects the whole body, and produces the most fatal consequences (comp. Ecclus. 21:2). Nachash is the generic name for any of the larger tribe of snakes (Genesis 3:1, etc.); the poisonous nature of its bite was, of course, well known (Numbers 21:9). Stingeth like an adder. The Hebrew word is tsiphoni, which is usually rendered \"cockatrice\" in the Authorized Version, but the particular species intended has not been accurately identified. There was some confusion in men's minds as to the organ which inflicted the poisonous wound. Thus a psalmist says, \"They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent\" (Psalm 140:3). But the verb \"sting\" is to be taken in the sense of puncturing, making a wound. Vulgate, Sicut regulus venena diffundet, \"It will diffuse its poison like a basilisk:\" Septuagint, \"But at the last he stretches himself like one stricken by a serpent, and the venom is diffused through him as by a horned snake (κεράστου).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The excitement occasioned by wine is now described. Thine eyes shall behold strange women. Ewald, Delitzsch, and others take זָדות to mean \"strange things,\" as affording a better parallel to the \"perverse things\" of the next clause. In this case the writer intends to denote the fantastic, often dreadful, images produced on the brain by the feverish condition of the inebriated. But the often denounced connection between drunkenness and incontinence, the constant reference to \"strange women\" in this book, and the general consensus of the versions, lead one to uphold the rendering of the Authorized Version. It seems, too, somewhat meagre to note these illusions as one of the terrible effects of intemperance, omitting all mention of the unbridling of lust, when the eyes look out for and rove after unchaste women. Thine heart shall utter perverse things (comp Proverbs 15:28; Matthew 15:19). The drunkard's notions are distorted, and his words partake of the same character; he confuses right and wrong; he says things which he would never speak if he were in full possession of his senses. Septuagint, \"When thine eyes shall see a strange woman, then thy mouth shall speak perverse things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - As he that lieth down in the midst of the sea. The dazed and unconscious condition of a drunkard is described by one familiar with sea life, as in Psalm 104:25, etc.; Psalms 107:23, etc. The Hebrew has \"in the heart of the sea\" (Jonah 2:4), i.e. the depth. Many understand the idea to be that the drunkard is compared to a man asleep in a frail boat, or to one slumbering on board a ship sunk in the trough of the sea. But the \"lying\" here does not imply sleep, but rather immersion. The inebriated person is assimilated to one who is drowned or drowning, who is cut off from all his former pursuits and interests in life, and has become unconscious of surrounding circumstances. This much more exactly represents the case than any notion of sloping amid danger. Septuagint, \"Thou shalt lie as in the heart of the sea.\" Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast; the extreme point of the sailyard, where no one could lie without the greatest peril of falling off. The drunkard is exposed to dangers of all kinds from being unable to take care of himself, and yet is all the time unconscious of his critical situation. Corn. a Lapide, followed by Plumptre, considers that the cradle, or look out, on the top of the mast is meant, where, if the watchman slept, he would be certain to endanger his life. Vulgate, \"like a pilot fallen asleep, who has dropped the tiller,\" and is therefore on the way to shipwreck. Septuagint, \"as a pilot in a great storm.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs23:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The drunkard is represented as speaking to himself. The LXX. inserts, \"and thou shelf say\" as the Authorized Version does: They have stricken me, shall thou say, and I was not sick; or, I was not hurt. The drunken man has been beaten (perhaps there is a reference to the \"contentions,\" ver. 29), but the blows did not pain him; his condition has rendered him insensible to pain. He has some vague idea the he has suffered certain rough treatment at the hands of his companions, but it has made no impression on him. They have beaten me, and I felt it not; did not even know it. Far from recognizing his degradation and profiting by the merzed chastisement which he has incurred, he is represented as looking forward with pleasure to a renewal of his debauch, when his drunken sleep shall be over. When shall I awake? I will seek it (wine) yet again. Some take מָתַי (mathai) as the relative conjunctive: \"When I awake I will seek it again;\" but it is always used interrogatively, and the expression thus becomes more animated, as Delitzsch observes. It is as though the drunkard has to yield to the effects of his excess and sleep off his intoxication, but he is. as it were, all the time longing to be able to rouse himself and recommence his orgies. We have had words put into the mouth of the sluggard (Proverbs 6:10). The whole verse is rendered by the LXX thus: \"Thou shalt say, They smote me, and I was not pained, and they mocked me, and I knew it not. When will it be morning, that I may go and seek those with whom I may consort?\" The author of the 'Tractutus de Conscientia' appended to St. Bernard's works, applies this paragraph to the cuss of an evil conscience indurated by wicked habits and insensible to correction.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - We return here to the more usual form, the tetrastich. Be not thou envious against evil men (see on Proverbs 23:17, where a similar warning is given, and comp. Ver. 19 below). \"Men of wickedness,\" wholly given over to evil. Neither desire to be with them. Their company is pollution, and association with them makes you a partner in their sinful doings.

Their lips talk of mischief; utter lies and slanders which may injure other people or bring themselves profit. Admiration of such men and intercourse with them must be repugnant to every religious soul. The LXX. refers the verse to evil imaginations issuing in evil talk; \"For their heart meditates falsehoods, and their lips speak mischiefs (πόνους).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrough wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - In contrast with the conversation of the evil, wisdom is commended.

Verse 5. - A wise man is strong. בעוז, \"in strength,\" full of strength, because, however feeble in body, he is wise in counsel, firm in purpose, brave in conduct, thoroughly to be depended upon, and supported by his perfect trust in God (comp. Proverbs 21:22). The Septuagint, with which agree the Syriac and Chaldee, reading differently, renders, \"A wise man is better than a strong man\" - a sentiment which Lesetre compares to Cicoro's \"cedant arma togae.\" A man of knowledge increaseth strength; literally, strengtheneth power; shows greater, superior power, as Amos 2:14. The Septuagint, from some corruption of the text, renders, \"And a man having prudence (is better) than a large estate (γεωργίου μεγάλου);\" i.e. wisdom will bring a man more worldly advantages than the possession of extensive farms. The gnome is proved by what follows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellers there is safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thy war; war for thyself, for thy profit, equivalent to \"successful war\" (comp. Exodus 14:14). The clause is an echo of Proverbs 20:18 (where see note). The last line is a repetition of Proverbs 11:14 (comp. also Proverbs 15:22). Septuagint, \"War is made with generalship (κυβερνήσεως), and help with a heart that counsels.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - Some distichs now follow, concerned with wisdom and its opposite. Verse 7. - Wisdom is too high for a fool. It is beyond his reach, he cannot follow its lead, and has nothing to say when his counsel is asked, and no ability to judge of any question presented to him. \"Wisdom\" (chochmoth) is in the plural number, intimating the various attributes connoted by it, or the different aspects in which it may be regarded (see note on Proverbs 1:20). \"Too high\" (ראמות, ramoth) is also plural; and Delitzsch and Nowack take it to mean, not so much \"high things\" as \"precious things,\" such as pearls or precious stones, in accordance with Job 28:18, \"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; yea,. the price of wisdom is above rubies.\" In this sense Delitzsch translates, \"Wisdom seems to the fool to be an ornamental commodity,\" a costly and unnecessary appendage, which is not worth the sacrifices entailed by its pursuit. Whichever way we take it, the point is the rarity and inaccessibility of wisdom, and the repugnance of fools to make any exertion in order to obtain it. St. Augustine thus sums up the steps by which wisdom is reached: fear of God, piety, knowledge, fortitude, mercifulness, sincerity ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 2:7). He openeth not him month in the gate. When men gather in the usual place of assembly (Proverbs 8:3; Proverbs 22:2), to take counsel on public matters, he has nothing to say; he listens fatuously, and is silent. Septuagint, \"Wisdom and good thought are in the gates of the wise; the wise turn not aside from the mouth of the Lord, but reason in assemblies.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He that deviseth to do evil. He who shows a certain kind of misapplied cleverness (in contrast to the true wisdom) in planning and pursuing evil schemes. Shall be called. Defined and explained, as Proverbs 16:21 (comp. Proverbs 21:24). A mischievous person; literally, lord of mischief; i.e. owner, possessor of mischief. One must not be led by such a man's apparent astuteness to attribute; to him wisdom; he is an impostor, a mere intriguer, who is sure to be exposed ere long. Septuagint, \"Death befalls the undisciplined.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The thought of foolishness is sin. \"Sin\" is the subject in this clause as \"the scorner\" is in the next; and what it says is that sin is the exeogitation, the contriving of folly. The stoner is the real fool, m that he does not pursue his proper end, prepares misery for himself, is blind to his best interests. The connection between sin and folly, as between wisdom and righteousness, is continually enforced throughout the book. The scorner is an abomination to men. The man who scoffs at religion and every high aim is an object of abomination to the pious, and is also a cause of evil to others, leading them to thoughts and acts which are hateful in the eyes of God. Septuagint, \"The fool dieth in sins (John 8:24), and uncleanness belongeth to a pestilent man.\" The text here followed, as in other passages of this chapter, is quite different from the received one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. The gnome seems to be unconnected with the preceding. There is a paronomasia between צָרָה (tsarah), \"adversity,\" and צַר (tsar), \"small,\" narrow, which is retained by Fleischer: \"Si segnis fueris die angustiae, angustae sunt vires tuae.\" So we may say in English, \"If thou faint in time of straitness, straitened is thy strength.\" If you fail, and succumb to anxiety or danger, instead of rising to meet the emergency, then you are but a weakling or a coward, and the strength which you seemed to possess and of which you boasted, perhaps, is nothing worth. Such a man hearkens not to the Sibyl's counsel (Virgil, 'AEneid,' 6:95) ?NEWLINENEWLINE\"Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito,NEWLINEQuam tua te fortuna sinet.\" The LXX. again varies from the received text, \"He shall be polluted in an evil day, and in a day of affliction, until he fail,\" or \"die\" (ἐκλίπῃ).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - A hexastich, inculcating humanity on the ground of God's omniscience. Verse 11. - If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death. The sentence is not conditional, אם in the second line being equivalent to לוּ, utinam, \"oh that!\" \"would that!\" So the first hemistich should be rendered, \"Deliver them that are haled to death,\" and the second, \"And those that are tottering to slaughter, oh, hold them back!\" The sentence is somewhat obscure, but Cheyne well explains it thus: \"Some victims of a miscarriage of justice are about to be dragged away to execution, and the disciple of wisdom is exhorted to use his endeavours to deliver them\" ('Job and Solomon'). In the case supposed a moral obligation lies on the pious and well-informed to save a human life unjustly imperilled. At the same time, there is nothing in the passage which absolutely, shows that the punishment of the guiltless is here deprecated; it looks rather as if Wisdom had no pleasure in the death of men, innocent or not, and that the victims of an extreme sentence claimed pity at her hands, whatever might be the circumstances of the verdict. Septuagint, \"Deliver those that are being led away to death, and redeem (ἐκπρίου) those that are appointed to be slain; spare not (to help them)\" (comp. Psalm 82:3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not. The disciple of Wisdom may excuse himself from making any effort for the prisoners' release, by saying he had not heard of the case. St. Jerome makes the excuse to be inability, vires non suppetunt. The LXX. makes it a personal matter, ignoring the plural form of the previous paragraph. \"I know him not, he is no friend of mine; why should I trouble myself about him?\" Such a selfish person, like the priest and Levite in the parable, would \"pass by on the other side.\" Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? God knows the truth - knows that the excuse is vain; for he is the Weigher and Searcher of hearts (Proverbs 16:2; Proverbs 21:2). Cain's plea, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" is unavailable; the law of love is limited by no circumstances. He that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? The expression, \"keeping the soul,\" may be equivalent to \"preserving the life;\" but it more probably means watching, observing, the inmost secrets of the nature (Job 7:20). The verb used is נָצַר (natsar), which has both significations. The sense of \"forming.\" which some give it, seems not allowable. (For \"heart\" (leb) and \"soul\" (nephesh), see note on Proverbs 2:10.) Shall not he render to every man according to his works? Knowing the heart and the motive, God deals out retributive justice (Proverbs 12:14; Psalm 62:12; Romans 2:6). Septuagint, \"But if thou say, I know not this man, know that the Lord knoweth the hearts of air; and he who formed (πλάσας) breath for all, himself knoweth all things, who rendereth to every man according to his works.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - An exhortation to the study of wisdom, with an analogy. Verse 13. - Eat thou honey, because it is good. Honey entered largely into the diet of the Oriental, and was regarded not only as pleasant to the taste and nutritious, but also as possessed of healing powers. It was especially used for children's food (Isaiah 7:15), and thus becomes an emblem of the purest wisdom. \"I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey,\" says the lover in Song of Solomon 5:1; and the psalmist says that the ordinances of the Lord are \"sweeter than honey and the honeycomb\" (Psalm 19:10; see on Proverbs 25:16). Palestine was a land flowing with milk and honey (Exodus 3:8); hence is derived the continual reference to this article of diet in the Bible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul; better, know, apprehend wisdom to be such for thy soul - to be as pleasant and nourishing and profitable to thy soul, as honey is to thy taste and thy body. The moralist would have his disciple feel the same relish for wisdom that he has for sweet food, recognize it not simply as useful, but as delightful and enjoyable. When thou hast found it. To find wisdom is to get possession of it and use it (comp. Proverbs 3:13, and note there). Then there shall be a reward. The apodosis begins here. We have had the same assurance in Proverbs 23:18 (where see note). The word is literally future. One who has obtained wisdom has a glorious hope before him; habebis in novissimis spem, Vulgate; but his hope is better than that - it goes with him, not in his last hour only, but all his life long. Septuagint, \"Then shalt thou perceive wisdom in thy soul; for if thou find it, fair shall be thine end, and hope shall not fail thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - A warning against plotting for the ruin of a good man's house, with a view doubtless of profiting by the disaster. Verse 15. - Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous. רָשָׁע (rasha) is vocative (comp. Ezekiel 33:8); taken appositionally, as in Revised Version margin, \"as a wicked man,\" it is senseless; for how could he lay wait in any other character? Spoil not his resting-place. \"Spoil,\" as Proverbs 19:26 (where see note). Drive him not from his house by violence and chicanery. Vulgate, \"Seek not impiety in the house of the righteous;\" do not attempt to cloak your insidious designs by detecting some evil in the good man, and making yourself the instrument of retribution, as if you were doing God service in afflicting him (John 16:2). Septuagint, \"Bring not an ungodly man into the pasture (νομῇ) of the righteous, neither be thou deceived by the feasting of the belly.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again. The fall may be taken of sin or of calamity. Preachers, ancient and modern, have made much use of this text in the first sense, expatiating how a good man may fall into venial or more serious sins, but he never loses his love of God, and rises from his fall by repentance on every occasion. We also often find the words in die, \"a day,\" added, which indeed occur in some manuscripts, but are not in the original. But the verb naphal seems not to be used in the sense of \"falling\" morally; and the meaning here is that the just man frequently falls into trouble, - he is not secure against worldly cares and losses, or the insidious attacks of the man mentioned in Ver. 15; but he never loses his trust in God or offends by fretfulness and impatience, and always God's providence watches over him and delivers him out of all his afflictions. \"Seven times\" means merely often, that number being used to express plurality or completeness (see on Proverbs 6:31; 26:16; and comp. Genesis 4:24; Job 5:19 (which is like our passage); and Matthew 18:22). The expectation which the sinner conceived when he saw the good man distressed, that he might seize the opportunity and use it to his own benefit, is woefully disappointed. In contrast with the recovery and reestablishment of the righteous, when the wicked suffer calamity there is no recuperation for them. The wicked shall fall into mischief; Revised Version better, are overthrown by calamity (comp. Proverbs 14:32, and note there). Septuagint,\" But the ungodly shall be weak in evils.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - A warning against vindictiveness, nearly approaching the great Christian maxim, \"Love your enemies\" (Matthew 5:44). Verse 17. - Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour\" was a Mosaic precept (Leviticus 19:18); the addition, \"and hate thine enemy,\" was a Pharisaic gloss, arising from a misconception concerning the extermination of the Canaanites, which, indeed, had a special cause and purpose, and was not a precedent for the treatment of all aliens (see Proverbs 25:21, 22). When he stumbleth; rather, when he is overthrown. The maxim refers to private enemies. The overthrow of public enemies was often celebrated with festal rejoicing. Thus we have the triumph of Moses at the defeat of the Amalekites, and over Pharaoh's host at the Red Sea; of Deborah and Barak over Sisera (Exodus 15; Exodus 17:15; Judges 5); and the psalmist, exulting over the destruction of his country's foes, could say, \"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked\" (Psalm 58:10). But private revenge and vindictiveness are warmly censured and repudiated. So Cato, 'Distich.' 4:46 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Morte repentina noli gaudere malorum;NEWLINEFelicesobeunt quorum sine crimine vita est.\" Of very different tone is the Italian proverb, \"Revenge is a morsel for God;\" and \"Wait time and place to act thy revenge, for it is never well done in a hurry\" (Trench).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him. This malignant pleasure at others' misfortunes (which Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 2:7. 15, calls ἐπιχαιρεκακία) is a sin in the eyes of God, and calls for punishment. And he turn away his wrath from him; and, as is implied, direct it upon thee. But it seems a mean motive to adduce, if the maxim is taken baldly to mean, \"Do not rejoice at your enemy's calamity, lest God relieve him from the evil:\" for true charity would wish for such a result. Bode considers \"his wrath\" to be the enemy's ill will against thee, which God by his grace changes to love, and thou art thus covered with confusion and shame for thy former vindictiveness. But the point is not so much the removal of God's displeasure from the enemy as the punishment of the malignant man, either mentally or materially. To a malignant mind no severer blow could be given than to see a foe recover God's favor and rise from his fall. The moralist then warns the disciple against giving way to this ἐπιχαιρεκακία lest he prepare for himself bitter mortification by having to witness the restoration of the hated one, or by being himself made to suffer that evil which he had rejoiced to see his neighbour experience (comp. Proverbs 17:5, and note there).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - A warning against envying the prosperity of the wicked. Verse 19. - Fret not thyself because of evil men (comp. Ver. 1 and Psalm 37:1). The verb (charah) means \"to burn,\" \"to be angry;\" so here we may render, \"Be not enraged on account of evil doers.\" The anger would arise on account of the apparent inequitable distribution of blessings. St. Jerome has, Ne contendas cum pessimis; Septuagint, \"Rejoice not over (ἐπὶ) evildoers.\" Neither be thou envious at the wicked; i.e. do not fancy that their prosperity is to be desired, nor be led to imitate their doings in order to secure like success. The new verse shows the solemn reason for this warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For there shall be no reward to the evil man. He has no happy \"future\" to expect, as Ver. 14; Proverbs 22:18 (where see note). The candle, etc. (see Proverbs 13:9, where the clause appears). Septuagint, \"For the evil man shall have no posterity, and the torch of the wicked shall be quenched.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - An injunction urging loyalty to God and the king. Verse 21. - Fear thou the Lord and the king. The king is God's vicegerent and representative, and therefore to be honoured and obeyed (see Ecclesiastes 8:2; Ecclesiastes 10:20; 1 Peter 2:17). Meddle not with them that are given to change. There is some doubt about the intepretation of the last word שׁונִים (shonim), which may mean those who change, innovators (in which transitive sense the verb does not elsewhere occur), or those who think differently, dissidents, who respect neither God nor the king. The verb שָׁנָה signifies transitively \"to repeat,\" and intransitively \"to be changed;\" so it may be most accurately translated here, with Delitzsch, \"those who are otherwise disposed,\" who have not the proper sentiments of fear and honour for God and the king. St. Jerome has, Et cum detractoribus non commiscearis, by which word he probably means what we call revolutionists, persons who disparage and despise all authority. Septuagint, \"Fear God and the king, and disobey neither of them.\" The verse has been largely used as a text by preachers who desired to recommend loyalty and to censure disaffection and rebellion. It has been a favourite motto for discourses on the Gunpowder Treason and the execution of Charles I.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For their calamity shall rise suddenly. Though these dissidents seem to succeed for a time, yet retribution shall fall suddenly upon them. And who knoweth the ruin of them both? This seems to mean the two classes, those who dishonour God and those who dishonour the king; but no such distinction is made in the previous verse; the rebels are classed under one category. Wordsworth renders, \"the stroke of vengeance from them both,\" i.e. from God and the king. Otherwise, we must give another signification to שׁניהם, and, with the Syriac and many modern commentators, take it in the sense of \"years,\" which שְׁנֵיהֶם will bear, as Job 36:11, and translate, \"The destruction [equivalent to 'end'] of their years, who knoweth?\" No one can tell when the crisis of their fate shall come; but it will arrive some day, and then the time of their prosperity will be at an end. Septuagint, \"For they (God and the king) will suddenly punish the ungodly; and who shall know the vengeance of both (τὰς τιμωρίας ἀμφοτέρων)?\" After this the LXX. inserts three proverbs not found now in the Hebrew, which, however, Ewald ('Jahrb. der Bibl. Wissensch.,' 11:17, etc.) considers to have been translated from a Hebrew original: \"A son that keepeth the commandment shall be safe from destruction (Proverbs 29:27, Vulgate), and he hath fully received it (the word). Let no lie be spoken by the tongue of the king; and no he shall proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not of flesh; and whosoever shall be delivered unto it shall be destroyed; for if his anger be inflamed, he consumes men with their nerves, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not food for the young eagles.\" The allusion at the end is to animals killed by lightning. Here follows the series of proverbs (Proverbs 30:1-14) called in the Hebrew, \"The words of Agur.\" The second part of \"the words of Agur,\" and \"the words of Lemuel\" (Proverbs 30:15-31:9) follow in the Greek after Proverbs 24:34 of the Hebrew. Delitzsch explains the matter thus: In the copy from which the Alexandrines translated, the appendix (Proverbs 30-31:9) was divided into two parts, half of it standing after \"the words of the wise\" (Proverbs 22:17-24:22), and half after the supplement containing further sayings of wise men (Proverbs 24:23-34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-34. - Part V. A SECOND COLLECTION, forming a second supplement to the first Solomonic book, and containing further \"words of the wise.\" Verses 23-25. - Partiality and impartiality a hexastich. Verse 23. - These things also belong to the wise; are the sayings of wise men. The following proverbs, as well as the preceding, are derived from wise men. Mistaking this superscription, the LXX. makes it a personal address: \"This I say to you who are wise, so that ye may learn.\" The first line is not a proverb, but the introduction to the ensuing collection. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment (see Proverbs 18:5, and note there; and Proverbs 28:21, where the expression is the same as here). To regard one person before another is to be partial and unjust. To say this error is \"not good\" is a meiosis, the meaning being that it is very evil and sinful (comp. Proverbs 20:23). The statement is developed and confirmed in the next two verses, which show the results of partiality and its opposite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous. The judge is supposed to be acquitting a guilty person. Him shall the people curse. The Hebrew is \"peoples,\" as Septuagint and Vulgate, maledicient eis populi. Nations shall abhor him. Not individuals, nor families only, but the whole community, wherever such an iniquitous ruler is found, shall execrate and hate him. The voice of the people is universally against him; no one is so blind and degraded as openly to applaud his nets. The verb nakab, \"to curse,\" means primarily \"to bore or pierce;\" hence some have translated it here, \"him shall the peoples stab.\" But the word is used in the sense of distinguishing by a mark or brand, and thence passes into the sense of cursing, as at Proverbs 11:26; Leviticus 24:11; Job 3:8. In Proverbs 17:15 the unjust judge is called an abomination to the Lord. In this case the vox populi is vox Dei.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But to them that rebuke him shall be delight (see on Proverbs 2:10). They who punish the wicked, with them it is well; they are approved by God and applauded by the people. Vulgate, Qui aruunt cum laudabuntur, \"They who convict him shall be praised.\" And a good blessing shall come upon them; literally, a blessing of good - one that has in it all good things, the happy contrast to the curses which meet the unjust judge. Septuagint, \"But they that convict them (the guilty) shall appear more excellent, and upon them shall come blessing.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - A distich connected with the subject of the preceding paragraph. Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer; or better, he kisseth the lips who giveth a right answer. An answer that is fair and suitable to the circumstances is as pleasant and assuring to the bearers as a kiss on the lips. Such a salutation would be a natural sign of sympathy and affection. Thus Absalom won the hearts of the people by kissing those who came to court with their suits (2 Samuel 15:5). In Genesis 41:40, where the Authorized Version has, \"According to thy word shall all my people be ruled,\" the Hebrew runs, \"Thy mouth shall all my people kiss,\" i.e. they shall do homage to thee, which is another signification of this action. This, however, would not be suitable here, as the kiss is supposed to be given by the speaker, though the LXX. mistakenly translates, \"But men will kiss lips that answer good words.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPrepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Prepare thy work without. The proverb enjoins a man to look well to his resources before he undertakes to build a house or to establish a family. \"Without\" (chuts) (Proverbs 7:12; Proverbs 8:26); in the fields. Put in due order all immediate work in thy farm. And make it fit for thyself in the field; and get ready for what has to come next. That is, in short, steadily and with due foresight cultivate your land; provide abundant means of subsistence before you attempt to build up your house. A suitor had, as it were, to purchase his bride from her relations by making considerable presents; it was therefore necessary to provide a certain amount of wealth before contemplating matrimony. And afterwards build thy house. This is, indeed, the meaning of the passage; but the Hebrew makes a difficulty, as it is literally, \"afterwards and thou shalt build.\" Some have supposed that some words have dropped out of the text (Cheyne, 'Job and Solomon'). But vav in וּבָנִיתָ, coming after a date or notification of time, as here after אַהַר (comp. Genesis 3:5), \"has the future signification of a perfect consecutive\" (Delitzsch), equivalent to \"after that, then, thou mayest build.\" Septuagint, \"Prepare thy works for thy going forth (εἰς τη,ν ἔξοδον), and get ready for the field, and come after me, and thou shalt build up thine house.\" In a spiritual sense, the heart must be first cleared of thorns, and opened to genial influences, before the man can build up the fabric of virtuous habits, and thus arrive at the virtuous character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause (chinnam); gratuitously (Proverbs 3:30; Proverbs 23:29; Proverbs 26:2), when you are not obliged in the performance of a plain duty. Persons are not to put themselves forward to give testimony to a neighbour's discredit, either officiously as busybodies, or maliciously as slanderers. The maxim is expressed in general terms and is not to be confined to one category, as the Syriac and Septuagint render, \"Be not a false witness against thy fellow citizen.\" And deceive not with thy lips. The Hebrew is really interrogative, \"And wouldest thou deceive with thy lips?\" (Psalm 78:36). The deceit is not so much intentional falsehood as misrepresentation arising from haste and inconsiderateness consequent on this unnecessary eagerness to push forward testimony unsought. Septuagint, \"Neither exaggerate (πλατύνου) with thy lips.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The subject is still continued, as if the moralist would say, \"Though a man has done you an injury by gratuitously testifying against you, do not you retaliate in the same way.\" Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me (see Proverbs 20:22, and note there). The lex talionis should not be applied to private wrongs. The high morality of the Christian code is here anticipated, the Holy Spirit guiding both.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-34. - A mashal ode concerning the sluggard (for similar odes, comp. Proverbs 7:41-23; Job 5:3-5; Psalm 37:35, etc.; Isaiah 5:1-6). Verse 30. - The field...the vineyard; the two chief objects of the farmer's care, which need constant labour if they are to prove productive. Moralizing on this passage, St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 20:54) says, \"To pass by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding, is to look into the life of any careless liver, and to take a view of his deeds.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Thorns. Kimmashon is the word here used, but the plant has not been certainly identified (comp. Isaiah 34:13). Nettles (charul). The stinging nettle is quite common in Palestine, but the plant here meant is probably the prickly acanthus, which quickly covers any spot left uncultivated (Job 30:7). Revised Version margin suggests wild vetches. Ovid, 'Trist.,' 5:12. 21 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Adde, quod ingenium louga rubigine laesumNEWLINETorpet, et est multo, quam fuitante, minus.NEWLINEFertilis, assiduo si non renovetur aratro,NEWLINENil, nisicum spinis gramen, habebit ager.\" So spiritual writers have used this apologue as teaching a lesson concerning the soul and the life of man, how that spiritual sloth allows the growth of evil habits, and the carelessness which maintains not the defence of law and prayer, but admits the enemy, and the result is the loss of the true riches and the perishing of the heavenly life. The two verses are thus rendered, or morally applied, in the Septuagint: \"A foolish man is as a farm. and a man wanting in sense is as a vineyard; if you leave him, he will be barren, and will be altogether covered with weeds, and he will become deserted, and his fences of stone are broken down.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Then I saw, and considered it well (Proverbs 22:17). I looked in this sight, and let it sink into my mind. I looked upon it, and received instruction (Proverbs 8:10). I learned a lesson from what I saw.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33, 34. - These verses are a repetition, with very slight variations, of Proverbs 6:10, 11 (where see notes), and possibly have been introduced here by a later editor. Ver. 33 seems to be the sluggard's own words; Ver. 34 shows the result of his sloth. There are numberless proverbs dedicated to this subject in all languages; e.g., \"No sweat, no sweet;\" \"No pains, no gains; .... He that wad eat the kernel maun crack the nut;\" \"A punadas entran las buenas hadas,\" \"Good luck enters by dint of cuffs\" (Spanish); \"Nihil agendo male agere discimus; .... The dog in the kennel,\" say the Chinese. \"barks at his fleas; the dog that hunts does not feel them\" (Kelly). \"Sloth and much sleep,\" say the Arabs, \"remove from God and bring on poverty.\" The LXX. is somewhat dramatic in its rendering: \"Afterwards I repented (μετενόησα), I looked that I might receive instruction. 'I slumber a little, I sleep a little, for a little I clasp (ἐναγκαλίζομαι) my hands across my breast.' But if thou do this, thy poverty will come advancing, and thy want like a good runner (ἀγαθὸς δρομεύς)\" The word ἐναγκαλίζομαι occurs in Proverbs 6:10, but nowhere else in the Septuagint. It is used by St. Mark (Mark 9:36; Mark 10:16). It has been thought that the original mashal ended with Ver. 32, the following passage being added by a scribe as illustrative in a marginal note, which afterwards crept into the text.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs24:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Prov.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-ch. 29. - Part VI. SECOND GREAT COLLECTION OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS, gathered by \"the men of Hezekiah,\" in which wisdom is set forth as the greatest blessing to the king and his subjects. Verse 1. - The superscription: These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah King of Judah copied out. The word \"also\" implies that a previous collection was known to the compiler of the present book - probably the one which we have in Proverbs 10-22:16, of which nine proverbs are inserted here. But there was still a large number of proverbial sayings attributed to Solomon, and preserved partly by oral tradition and partly in writing, which it was advisable to collect and secure before they were lost. The zeal of Hezekiah took this in hand. He was not, as far as we know, an author himself, but he evidently felt a warm interest in literature, and \"the men of Hezekiah,\" not mentioned elsewhere, must have been his counsellors and scholars, to whom was entrusted the duty of gathering together into a volume the scattered sayings of the wise king. Among those contemporaries, doubtless, Isaiah was eminent, and it is not improbable that Shebna the scribe and Josh the chronicler were members of the learned fraternity (2 Kings 18:18). The verb rightly translated \"copied out\" (athak) means, properly, \"to remove,\" \"to transfer\" from one place to another (transtulerunt, Vulgate); hence it signifies here to copy into a book words taken from other writings or people's mouths. The sayings thus collected, whether truly Solomon's or not, were extant under his name, and were regarded as worthy of his reputation for wisdom. The title is given in the Septuagint, thus: Αῦται αἱ παιδεῖαι Σαλωμῶντος αἱ ἀδιάκριτοι α}ς ἐξεγραψαντο οἱ φίλοι Ἐζεκίου τοῦ βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας. What is meant by ἀδιάκριτοι is uncertain. It has been translated \"impossible to distinguish,\" equivalent to \"miscellaneous;\" \"beyond doubt,\" equivalent to \"genuine,\" \"hard to interpret,\" as in Polyb., 15:12, 9. St. James (James 3:17) applies the term to wisdom, but the interpreters there are not agreed as to the meaning, it being rendered \"without partiality,\" \"without variance,\" \"without doubtfulness,\" etc. It seems best to take the word as used by the LXX. to signify \"mixed,\" or \"miscellaneous.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-7. - Proverbs concerning kings. Verse 2. - It is the glory of God to conceal a thing. That which is the chief glory of God is his mysteriousness, the unfathomable character of his nature and attributes and doings. The more we search into these matters, the more complete we find our ignorance to be; finite faculties are utterly unable to comprehend the infinite; they can embrace merely what God chooses to reveal. \"Secret things belong unto the Lord our God\" (Deuteronomy 29:29), and the great prophet, favoured with Divine revelations, can only confess, \"Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself\" Isaiah 45:15; comp Ecclesiastes 8:17; Romans 11:33, etc.). But the honour of kings is to search out a matter. The same word is used for \"glory\" and \"honour\" in both clauses, and ought to have been rendered similarly. It is the king's glory to execute justice and to defend the rights and safety of his people. To do this effectually he must investigate matters brought before him, look keenly into political difficulties, get to the bottom of all complications, and watch against possible dangers. The contrast between the glory of God and that of the king lies in this - that whereas both God and the king desire man's welfare, the former promotes this by making him feel his ignorance and littleness and entire dependence upon this mysterious Being whose nature and designs mortals cannot understand; the latter advances the good of his subjects by giving them confidence in his zeal and power to discover truth, and using his knowledge for their benefit. Septuagint, \"The glory of God concealeth a word (λόγον): but the glory of a king honoureth matters (πράγματα).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This proverb is connected with the preceding by the idea of \"searching\" (chakar) common to both. Such emblematic proverbs are common in this second collection (see Ver. 11). Three subjects are stated, of which is predicated the term unsearchable, viz. The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings. As you can never rise to the illimitable height of the heavens, as you can never penetrate to the immeasurable depth of the earth, so you can never fathom the heart of a king, can never find out what he really thinks and intends (comp. Job 11:8). It may be that tacitly a warning is intended against flattering one's sell that one knows and can reckon on the favour of a king; his good disposition towards you may be only seeming, or may any moment become changed. The Septuagint has for \"unsearchable\" (חֵקֶר אֵין) ἀνεξέλεγκτος, \"unquestionable.\" The commentators refer to a passage in Tacitus ('Ann.' 6:8), where M. Terentius defends himself for being a friend of Sejanus by the fact of the impossibility of investigating a great man's real sentiments. \"To us,\" he says to Tiberius, \"it appertains not to judge whom you exalt above all others and for what reason you do so. Facts which are obvious we all notice. We see who is the man upon whom you heap wealth and honours, who it is that has the chief power of dispensing rewards and punishments; that these were possessed by Sejanus no one can deny. But to pry into the hidden thoughts of a prince, and the designs which he meditates in secret, is unlawful and hazardous; nor would the attempt succeed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - A tetrastich in an emblematical form. Verse 4. - Take away the dross from the silver. Silver was most extensively used by the Hebrews (see 'Dictionary of the Bible,' sub voc.), whether obtained from native mines or imported from foreign countries, and the process of separating the ore from the extraneous matters mixed with it was well known (Psalm 12:6; Ezekiel 22:20, etc.; see on Proverbs 17:3). And there shall come forth a vessel for the finer (tsaraph); the goldsmith. The pure silver is ready for the artist s work, who from this material can make a beautiful vessel. Septuagint, \"Beat untested silver, and all shall be made entirely pure,\" where the allusion is to the process of reducing minerals by lamination.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Take away the wicked from before the king. Let the wicked be removed from the presence of the king, as dross is separated from the pure silver (see the same metaphor, Isaiah 1:25; Jeremiah 6:29, etc.). And his throne shall be established in righteousness (Proverbs 16:12: 29:14). The king detects the evil and punishes them; and this confirms his rule and secures the continuance of his dynasty. Thus righteousness triumphs, and wickedness is properly dealt with. Septuagint, \"Slay the ungodly from the face of the king, and his throne shall prosper in righteousness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPut not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Another proverb (a pentastich) connected with kings and great men. Verse 6. - Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king. Do not make display of yourself as though vying with the king in outward circumstances. Septuagint, \"Boast not thyself (μὴ ἀλαζονεύον) in the presence of a king.\" Stand not in the place of great men. Do not pretend to be the equal of those who occupy high places in the kingdom (Proverbs 18:16). Septuagint, \"And take not your stand (ὑφίστασο) in the places of chieftains.\" Says a Latin gnome, \"Qui cum fortuna convenit, dives est;\" and Ovid wrote well ('Trist.,' 3:4. 25, etc.) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Crede mihi; bene qui latuit, bene vixit; et intraNEWLINEFortunam debet quisque manere suam...NEWLINETu quoque formida nimium sublimia semper;NEWLINEPropositique memor contrahe vela tui.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither. It is better for the prince to select you for elevation to a high post; to call you up near his throne. The reference is not necessarily to position at a royal banquet, though the maxim lends itself readily to such application. This warbling against arrogance and presumption was used by our blessed Lord in enforcing a lesson of humility and self-discipline (Luke 14:7, etc ). Septuagint, \"For it is better for thee that it should be said, Come up unto me (ἀνάβαινε πρὸς μέ)\" (προσανάβηθι ἀνώτερον, Luke 14:7). Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. The last words have been variously interpreted: \"to whom thou hast come with a request for preferment;\" \"into whose august presence thou hast been admitted, so as to see his face\" (2 Samuel 14:24); \"who knows all about thee, and will thus make thee feel thy humiliation all the more.\" But nadib, rendered \"prince,\" is not the king, but any noble or great man; and what the maxim means is this - that it is wise to save yourself from the mortification of being turned out of a place which you have knowingly usurped. Your own eyes see that he is in the company; you are aware of what is his proper position; you have occupied a post which belongs to another; justly you are removed, and all present witness your humiliation. The moralist knew that the bad spirit of pride was fostered and encouraged by every act of self-assertion; hence the importance of his warning. The Septuagint makes a separate sentence of these last words, \"Speak thou of what thine eyes saw,\" or, perhaps, like St. Jerome, the Syriac, and Symmachus, attach them to the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - A tristich with no parallelism. Go not forth hastily to strive. The idea is either of one entering into litigation with undue haste, or of one hurrying to meet an adversary. St. Jerome, taking in the final words of the previous verse, renders, Quae viderunt oculi tui, ne proferas in jurgio cito, \"What thine eyes have seen reveal not hastily in a quarrel.\" This is like Ver. 9 below, and Christ's injunction, \"If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone\" (Matthew 18:15). Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof. The Hebrew is elliptical, \"Lest by chance (פֶן) thou do something (bad, humiliating) in the end thereof.\" But Delitzsch, Nowack, and others consider the sentence as interrogative (as 1 Samuel 20:19), and translate, \"That it may not be said in the end thereof, What wilt thou do?\" Either way, the warning comes to this - Do not enter hastily upon strife of any kind, lest thou be utterly at a loss what to do. When thy neighbour hath put thee to shame, by putting thee in the wrong, gaining his cause, or getting the victory over thee in some way. Septuagint, \"Fall not quickly into a contest, lest thou repent at the last.\" There is an English proverb, \"Anger begins with folly and ends with repentance;\" and \"Haste is the beginning of wrath, its end is repentance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDebate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - A tetrastich without parallelism, connected with the preceding maxim. Verse 9. - Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself (Matthew 18:15; see on ver. 8). If you have any quarrel with a neighbour, or are drawn into a controversy with him, deal with him privately in a friendly manner. And discover not a secret to another; rather, the secret of another. Do not bring in a third party, or make use of anything entrusted to you by another person, or of which you have become privately informed, in order to support your cause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame; i.e. lest any one, not the offended neighbour only, who hears how treacherous you have been, makes your proceeding known and cries shame upon you. And thine infamy turn not away. The stigma attached to you be never obliterated. Thus Siracides: \"Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbour\" (Ecclus. 27:16, etc.; comp. also 22:22). The motive presented in our text is not the highest, being grounded on the fear of shame and disgrace in men's eyes; but it is a very potent incentive to right action, and the moralist has good reason for employing it. That it does not reach to the height of Christian morality is obvious. The gnome is thus given in the Greek: \"When thy friend shall reproach thee, retreat backward, despise him not, lest thy friend reproach thee still; and so thy quarrel and enmity shall not pass away, but shall be to thee like death.\" Then the LXX. adds a paragraph, reproduced partly by St. Jerome, \"Kindness and friendship set a man free (ἐλευθεροῖ); preserve thou these, that thou become not liable to reproach (ἐπονείδισοτς, exprobabilis); but guard thy ways in a conciliating spirit (εὐσυναλλάκτως).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - One of the emblematical distiches in which this collection is rich. A word fitly spoken. עַל־אָפְנָיו may be translated \"in due season,\" or \"upon its wheels\" (Venetian, ἐπὶ τῶν τροχῶν αὐτῆς). In the latter case the phrase may mean a word quickly formed, or moving easily, spoken ore rotundo, or a speedy answer. But the metaphor is unusual and inappropriate; and it is best to understand a word spoken under due consideration of time and place. Vulgate, Qui loquitur verbum in tempore suo; Aquila and Theodotion, ἐπὶ ἁρμόζουσιν αὐτῷ, \"in circumstances that suit it;\" the Septuagint has simply οὕτως. Is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. In these emblematical distichs the words, \"is like,\" in the Authorized Version, are an insertion. The Hebrew places the two ideas merely in sequence; the object with which some, thing is compared usually coming before, that which is compared with it, as here, \"Apples of gold - a word fitly spoken\" (so in vers. 14, 18, 19, 26, 28). There is a doubt about the meaning of the word rendered \"pictures,\" maskith (see on Proverbs 18:11). It seems to be used generally in the sense of \"image,\" \"sculpture,\" being derived from the verb שָׁכָה, \"to see;\" from this it comes to signify \"ornament,\" and here most appropriately is \"basket,\" and, as some understand, of filagree work. St. Jerome mistakes the word, rendering, in lectis argenteis. The Septuagint has, ἐν ὁρμίσκῳ σαρδίου, \"on a necklace of sardius.\" \"Apples of gold\" are apples or other fruits of a golden colour, not made of gold, which would be very costly and heavy; nor would the comparison with artificial fruits be as suitable as that with natural. The \"word\" is the fruit set off by its circumstances, as the latter's beauty is enhanced by the grace of the vessel which contains it. The \"apple\" has been supposed to be the orange (called in late Latin pomum aurantium) or the citron. We may cite here the opinion of a competent traveller: \"For my own part,\" says Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 605), \"I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that the apricot alone is the 'apple' of Scripture Everywhere the apricot is common; perhaps it is, with the single exception of the fig, the most abundant fruit of the country. In highlands and lowlands alike, by the shores of the Mediterranean and on the banks of the Jordan, in the nooks of Judea, under the heights of Lebanon, in the recesses of Galilee, and in the glades of Gilead, the apricot flourishes, and yields a crop of prodiscus abundance. Its characteristics meet every condition of the 'tappuach' of Scripture. 'I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste' (Song of Solomon 2:3). Near Damascus, and on the banks of the Barada, we have pitched our tents under its shade, and spread our carpets secure from the rays of the sun. 'The smell of thy nose (shall be) like tappuach' (Song of Solomon 7:8). There can scarcely be a more deliciously perfumed fruit than the apricot; and what fruit can better fit the epithet of Solomon, 'apples of gold in pictures of silver,' than this golden fruit, as its branches bend under the weight in their setting of bright yet pale foliage?\" Imagery similar to that found in this verse occurs in Proverbs 10:31; Proverbs 12:14; Proverbs 13:2; Proverbs 18:20. There is a famous article on the analogies between flowers and men's characters in the Spectator, No. 455.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Another distich concerning the seasonable word, of the same character as the last. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold. In this, as in many of the proverbs, the comparison is not expressed, but is merely implied by juxtaposition. Nezem, in Proverbs 11:22, was a nose ring, here probably an earring is meant; chali, \"ornament,\" is a trinket or jewel worn suspended on neck or breast. The two, whether worn by one person or more, form a lovely combination, and set off the wearer's grace and beauty. Vulgate, Inauris aurea et margaritum fulgens, \"A golden earring and a brilliant pearl.\" Septuagint, \"A golden earring a precious sardius also is set.\" So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. The obedient ear receives the precepts of the wise reprover, and wears them as a valued ornament. In Proverbs 1:9 the instruction of parents is compared to a chaplet on the head and a fair chain on the neck. Septuagint, \"A wise word on an obedient ear.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A comparative tristich concerning words. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest. This, of course, does not mean a snowstorm or hailstorm in the time of harvest, which would be anything but a blessing (Proverbs 26:1; 1 Samuel 12:17, 18), but either the distant view of the snow on Hermon or Lebanon, which gave an idea of refreshment in the heat of autumn, or more probably snow used to cool drink in warm weather. This luxury was not unknown in the time of Solomon, who had a summer palace on Lebanon (1 Kings 9:19), though it could have been enjoyed by very few, and would not speak to the personal experience of the burgher class, to whom the proverbs seem to have been addressed. Xenophon writes of the use of snow to cool wine ('Memorab.,' 2:1. 30). Hitzig quotes a passage from the old history of the Crusades, called 'Gesta Dei per Francos,' which runs thus: \"Nix frigidissima a monte Libano defertur, ut vino commixta, tanquam glaciem ipsum frigidum reddat.\" So in the present day snow is sold in Damascus bazaars. The LXX., not realizing what harm such an untimely storm might effect, translates, \"As a fall (ἔξοδος) of snow in harvest is of use against heat, so a faithful messenger benefits those who sent him.\" So is a faithful messenger to them that send him. (For \"faithful messenger,\" see on Proverbs 13:17; and for \"them that send,\" see on Proverbs 22:21.) The comparison is explained. For he refresheth the soul of his masters. He brings as great refreshment to his masters' mind as would a drink of snow-cooled water in the burning harvest field.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Hebrew is, Clouds and wind without rain - he that boasteth himself in a gift of falsehood (see on Ver. 11). The proverb is concerned with promises disappointed. Clouds and wind are generally in the East the precursors of heavy rain, as we read in 1 Kings 18:45, \"In a little while the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.\" After such phenomena, which, according to current meteorological observation, gave every hope of a refreshing shower in the time of summer drought, to see the clouds pass away without affording a single drop of rain is a grievous disappointment. The metaphor is found in the New Testament. St. Jude (Ver. 12) calls false teachers \"clouds without water, carried along by winds.\" \"A gift of falsehood,\" equivalent to \"a false gift,\" one that deceives, because it is only promised and never given. A man makes a great parade of going to bestow a handsome present, and then sneaks out of it, and gives nothing. Such a one is, as St. Jerome renders, Vir gloriosus, et promissa non complens. The old commentators quote Ovid, 'Heroid.,' 6:509 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Mobilis AEsonide, vernaque incertior aura,NEWLINECur tua pollicito pondere verba carent?\" Deeds are fruits, says the proverb, \"words are but leaves;\" and \"Vainglory blossoms, but never bears fruit.\" Concerning the folly of making stupid boasts, the Bengalee proverb speaks of a pedlar in ginger getting tidings of his ship. The Septuagint is incorrect, \"As winds, and clouds, and rains are most evident (ἐπιφανέστατα), so is he who boasts of a false gift.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - By long forbearing; i.e. by patience, calmness that does not break out into passion whatever be the provocation, even, it is implied, in the face of a false and malicious accusation (comp. Proverbs 14:29). Is a prince persuaded. Katson is rather \"an arbiter,\" or judge, than \"a prince,\" and the proverb says that such an officer is led to take a favourable view of an accused person's case when he sees him calm and composed, ready to explain the matter without any undue heat or irritation, keeping steadily to the point, and not seduced by calumny or misrepresentation to forget himself and lose his temper. Such a bearing presupposes innocence and weighs favourably with the judge. The LXX. makes the gnome apply to monarchs alone, \"In long suffering is prosperity unto kings.\" A soft tongue breaketh the bone. A soft answer (Proverbs 15:1), gentle, conciliating words, overcome opposition, and disarm the most determined enemy, and make tender in him that which was hardest and most uncompromising. \"Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo.\" Similar proverbs are found elsewhere, though probably in a different sense. Thus in modern Greek, \"The tongue has no bones, yet it breaks bones;\" in Turkish, \"The tongue has no bone, yet it crushes;\" again, \"One drop of honey,\" says the Turk, \"catches more bees than a ton of vinegar.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Hast thou found honey? Honey would be found in crevices of rocks, in hollow trees (1 Samuel 14:27), or in more unlikely situations (Judges 14:8), and was extensively used as an article of food. All travellers in Palestine note the great abundance of bees therein, and how well it answers to its description as \"a land flowing with milk and honey.\" Eat so much as is sufficient for thee. The agreeable sweetness of honey might lead the finder to eat too much of it. Against such excess the moralist warns: Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. Thus wrote Pindar, 'Nem.,' 7:51 -NEWLINENEWLINEἈλλὰ γὰρ ἀνάπαυσις ἐν παντὶ γλυκεῖα ἔργῳκόρον δ ἔχειNEWLINEΚαὶ μέλι καὶ τὰ τέρπν ἄνθε Ἀφροδισια. Μηδὲν ἄγαν, Ne quid nimis, is a maxim continually urged by those who wished to teach moderation. Says Homer, 'Iliad,' 13:636 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Men are with all things sated - sleep, and love,NEWLINESweet sounds of music, and the joyous dance.\"NEWLINE(Lord Derby.) Says Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:1, 106 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,NEWLINEQuos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum?\" The honey is a figure of all that pleases the senses; but the maxim is to be extended beyond physical matters, though referring primarily to such pleasures. The mind may be overloaded as well as the body: only such instruction as can be digested and assimilated is serviceable to the spiritual nature; injudicious cramming produces satiety and disgust. Again, \"To 'find honey,'\" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 16:8), \"is to taste the sweetness of holy intelligence, which is eaten enough of then when our perception, according to the measure of our faculty, is held tight under control. For he is 'filled with honey, and vomits it' who, in seeking to dive deeper than he has capacity for, loses that too from whence he might have derived nourishment.\" And in another place (ibid., 20:18), \"The sweetness of spiritual meaning he who seeks to eat beyond what he contains, even what he had eaten he 'vomiteth;' because, whilst he seeks to make out things above, beyond his powers, even the things that he had made out aright, he forfeits\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; literally, make thy foot precious, rare; Septuagint, \"Bring thy foot sparingly (σπάνιον) into thy friend's house,\" The proverb seems to be loosely connected with the preceding, as urging moderation. Do not pay too frequent visits to your neighbors' house, or make yourself too much at home there. The Son of Sirach has an utterance on a somewhat similar subject, \"Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house. Those things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of house room, and reproaching of the lender\" (Ecclus. 29:27, etc.). Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. Such a result might easily arise from too constant intercourse. Cornelius a Lapide quotes from Seneca ('De Benefic,' 1:15), \"Rarum esse oportet quod diu carum velis,\" \"That should be rare which you would enduringly bear.\" And Martial's cynical advice -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nulli te facias nimis sodalem;NEWLINEGaudebis minus, et minus dolebis.\" The same poet ('Epigr.,' 4:29, 3) writes -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Rara juvant; primis sic major gratia pomis,NEWLINEHibernae pretium sic meruere rosae.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Hebrew, A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow - a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour (see on Ver. 11). One who bears false witness against his neighbour prepares for him the instruments of death, such as those mentioned here. \"A maul\" (mephits), usually a heavy wooden hammer (compare malleus and \"mallet\"); here a club, or mace, used in battle, ῤόπαλον (Septuagint; comp. Jeremiah 51:20). There is a kind of climax in the three offensive weapons named - the club bruises, the sword inflicts wounds, the arrow pierces to the heart; and the three may represent the various baneful effects of false testimony, how it bruises reputation, spoils possessions, deprives of life. The second clause is from the Decalogue (Exodus 20:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConfidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Hebrew (see on Ver. 11), A broken tooth, and a foot out of joint - confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble. A faithless man is as little to be relied on in a time of need as a loose or broken tooth, and a foot unsteady or actually dislocated. You cannot bite on the one, you cannot walk on the other; so the perfidious man fails you when most wanted. Septuagint, \"The way [ὁδὸς, Vatican, is probably a clerical error for ὀδοὺς, al.] of the wicked, and the foot of the transgressor, shall perish in an evil day.\" A Bengal maxim runs, \"A loose tooth and a feeble friend are equally bad\" (Lane).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather. The proverb gives three instances of what is wrong, incongruous, or unwise, the first two leading up to the third, which is the pith of the maxim. But them is some doubt about the rendering of the first clause. The Authorized Version has the authority of the Syriac, Aquila, and others, and gives an appropriate sense, the unreasonable proceeding being the laying aside of some of one's own clothes in cold weather. But the verb here used, עָדָח (adah), may also mean \"to adorn,\" e.g., with fine garments; hence some expositors understand the incongruity to be the dressing one's self in gay apparel in winter. But, as Delitzsch remarks, there is no reason why fine clothes should not be warm; and if they are so, there is nothing unreasonable in wearing them. The rendering of our version is probably correct. St. Jerome annexes this line to the preceding verse, as if it confirmed the previous instances of misplaced confidence, Et amittit pallium in die frigoris. \"Such a one loses his cloak in a day of frost.\" Vinegar upon nitre. Our nitre, or saltpetre, is nitrate of potash, which is not the substance intended by נֶתֶר (nether). The substance signified by this term is a natural alkali, known to the ancients as natron, and composed of carbonate of soda with some other admixture. It was used extensively for washing purposes, and in cookery and bread making. It effervesces with an acid, such as vinegar, and changes its character, becoming a salt, and being rendered useless for all the purposes to which it was applied in its alkaline condition. So he who pours vinegar on natron does a foolish thing, for he spoils a highly useful article, and produces one which is of no service to him. Septuagint, \"As vinegar is inexpedient for a wound (ἕλκει), so suffering falling on the body pains the heart.\" Schulteus, Ewald, and others, by referring nether to an Arabic source, obtain the meaning \"wound,\" or \"sore,\" titus: \"As vinegar on a sore.\" This gives a most appropriate sense, and might well be adopted if it had sufficient authority. But this is doubtful. Cornelius a Lapide translates the Septuagint rendering, Ὥσπερ ὅξος ἑλκει ἀούμφορον, \"Sicut acetum trahit inutile;\" and explains that vinegar draws from the soil the nitre which is prejudicial to vegetation, and thus renders ground fertile - a fact in agricultural chemistry not generally known, though Columella vouches for it. A somewhat similar fact, however, is of common experience. Land occasionally becomes what farmers term \"sour,\" and is thus sterile; if it is then dressed with salt. its fertillity is restored. So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. The inconsistency lies in thinking to cheer a sorrowful heart by singing merry songs. \"A tale out of season,\" says Siracides, \"is as music in mourning\" (Ecclus. 22:6). The Greeks denoted cruel incongruity by the proverb, Ἐν, πενθοῦσι παίζειν; \"Ludere inter maerentes.\" As the old hymn says -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Strains of gladnessNEWLINESuit not souls with anguish torn.\" The true Christian sympathy teaches to \"rejoice with them that rejoice, to weep with them that weep\" (Romans 12:15). Plumptre, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' suggests that the effervescence caused by the mixture of acid and alkali is taken as a type of the irritation produced by the inopportune songs. But this is importing a modern view into a paragraph, such as would never have occurred to the writer. The Septuagint, followed partially by Jerome, the Syriac, and the Targum, introduces another proverb not found in the Hebrew, \"As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the sorrow of a man hurts his heart.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - This famous tetrastrich is reproduced (with the exception of the fourth line) from the Septuagint by St. Paul (Romans 12:20). Verse 21. - The traditional hatred of enemies is here strongly repudiated (see Proverbs 24:17, 18, and notes there). Thus Elisha treated the Syrians, introduced blindly into the midst of Samaria, ordering the King of Israel to set bread and water before them, and to send them away unharmed (2 Kings 6:22). \"Punish your enemy by benefiting him,\" say the Arabs, though they are far from practising the injunction; \"Sweet words break the bones;\" \"Bread and salt humble even a robber,\" say the Russians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. This expression has been taken in various senses. It has been thought to mean that the forgiveness of the injured person brings to the cheek of the offender the burning blush of shame. But heaping coals on the head cannot naturally be taken to express such an idea. St. Chrysostom and other Fathers consider that Divine vengeance is implied, as in Psalm 11:6, \"Upon the wicked he shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be their portion;\" and Psalm 140:10, \"Let burning coals fall upon them.\" Of course, in one view, kindness to an evil man only gives him occasion for fresh ingratitude and hatred, and therefore increases God's wrath against him. But it would be a wicked motive to act this beneficent part only to have the satisfaction of seeing your injurer humbled or punished. And the gnome implies that the sinner is benefited by the clemency shown to him, that the requital of evil by good brings the offender to a better mind, and aids his spiritual life. \"Coals of fire\" are a metaphor for the penetrating pain of remorse and repentance. The unmerited kindness which he receives forces upon him the consciousness of his ill doing, which is accompanied by the sharp rain of regret. St. Augustine, \"Ne dubitaveris figurate dictum...ut intelligas carbones ignis esse urentes poenitentiae gemitus, quibus superbia sanatur ejus, qui dolit se inimicum fuisse hominis, a quo ejus miseriae subvenitur\" ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 3:16). Lesetre quotes St. Francis de Sales, who gives again a different view, \"You are not obliged to seek reconciliation with one who has offended you; it may be rather his part to seek you; yet nevertheless go and follow the Saviour's counsel, prevent him with good, render him good for evil: heap coals of fire on his head and on his heart, which may burn up all ill will and constrain him to love you\" ('De l'Am. de Dieu,' 8:9). And the Lord shall reward thee. This consideration can scarcely be regarded as the chief motive for the liberality enjoined, though it would be present to the kind person's mind, and be a support and comfort to him in a course of conduct repugnant to the natural man. He would remember the glorious reward promised to godliness by the prophet (Isaiah 58:8, etc.), and how Saul had expressed his consciousness of David's magnanimity in sparing his life. \"Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil... wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day\" (1 Samuel 24:17, 19 and 1 Sam 26:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The north wind driveth away rain. So St. Jerome (Ventus Aquilo dissipat pluvias), Symmachus, Aben Ezra, and others. The north wind is called by the natives of Palestine \"the heavenly,\" from the bright effect which it produces in the sky. \"By means of the north wind cometh he (the sun) forth as gold\" (Job 37:22). But the verb here used (חול) means \"to bring forth, produce\" (Psalm 90:2); hence the Revised Version rightly renders, \"The north wind bringeth forth rain.\" This is quite true if \"north wind\" be taken as equivalent to \"wind from the dark quarter\" (Umbreit), like ζόφος in Greek; and, in fact, the northwest wind in Palestine does bring rain. Septuagint, \"The north wind arouseth (ἐξεγείρει) clouds.\" So doth an angry countenance a backbiting, tongue. Carrying on the interpretation intended by the Authorized Version, this clause means that an angry leer will check a slanderer and incline him to hold his peace from prudential motives. But with the rendering given above, \"bringeth forth,\" another explanation is involved, viz. \"So does a secret, slandering tongue cause a troubled countenance.\" When a man discovers that a secret slanderer is working against him, he shows it by his gloomy and angry look, as the sky is dark with clouds when a storm is threatened. \"Countenance\" is plural in the Hebrew, denoting, as Hitzig points out, that the calumniator does not affect one person only, but occasions trouble far and wide, destroys friendly relations between many, excites suspicion and enmity in various quarters Septuagint, \"An impudent countenance provokes the tongue.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A repetition of Proverbs 21:9, taken therefore from the Solomonic collection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - As cold waters to a thirsty soul. The particle of comparison is not in this first clause in the Hebrew. (For \"cold waters,\" comp. Jeremiah 18:14.) So is good news from a far country. The nostalgia of an exile, and the craving for tidings of him felt by his friends at home, are like a parching thirst. The relief to the latter, when they receive good news of the wanderer, is as refreshing as a draught of cool water to a fainting, weary man. We do not know that the Hebrews were great travellers in those days; but any communication from a distant country would be very uncertain in arriving at its destination, and would at any rate take a long time in transmission, in most cases there would be nothing to rest upon but vague report, or a message carried by some travelling merchant. There is a somewhat similar proverb found at Ver. 13 and Proverbs 15:30. The ancient commentators have seen in this news from a distant country the announcement of Christ's birth by the angels at Bethlehem, or the preaching of the gospel that tells of the joys of heaven, the land that is very far off (Isaiah 33:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Hebrew (see on Ver. 11), A troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring - a righteous man giving way to the wicked. A good man neglecting to assert himself and to hold his own m the face of sinners, is as useless to society and as harmful to the good cause as a spring that has been defiled by mud stirred up or extraneous matter introduced is unserviceable for drinking and prejudicial to those who use it. The mouth of the righteous should be \"a well of life\" (Proverbs 10:11), wholesome, refreshing, helpful; his conduct should be consistent and straightforward, fearless in upholding the right (Isaiah 51:12, etc.), uncompromising in opposing sin. When such a man, for fear, or favour, or weakness, or weariness, yields to the wicked, compromises principle, no longer makes a stand for truth and purity and virtue, he loses his high character, brings a scandal on religion, and lowers his own spiritual nature. It is this moral cowardice which Christ so sternly rebukes (Matthew 10:33), \"Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\" Some have assumed that the gnome is concerned with a good man's fall into misfortune owing to the machinations of sinners; but in this case the comparison loses its force; such persecution would not disturb the purity or lower the character of the righteous man; it would rather enhance his good qualities, give occasion for their exercise and development, and therefore could not be described as fouling a pure spring.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - It is not good to eat much honey. The ill effects of a surfeit of honey have been already mentioned (Ver. 16); but here the application is different, and occasions some difficulty. The Authorized Version, in order to clear up the obscurity of the text, inserts a negative, So for men to search their own glory is not glory, which seems to be a warning against conceit and self-adulation. This is hardly warranted by the present Hebrew text, which is literally, as Venetian renders, Ἔρευνά τε δόξας αὐτῶν δόξα, \"The search of their glory [is] glory.\" But who are meant by \"their\"? No persons are mentioned in the verse to whom the suffix in כְּבורָם can be referred, and it is not improbable that some words have dropped out of the text. At the same time, we might naturally in thought supply \"for men\" after \"it is not good,\" such omissions being not uncommon in proverbial sayings; the suffix then would refer to them. Commentators have endeavoured to amend the text by alterations which do not commend themselves. Schultens supposes that the suffix had reference to the Divine law and revelations, and, as כבד may mean both \"glory\" and \"weight,\" translates, \"Vestigatio gravitatis eorum, gravitas.\" Bertheau takes kabod in two different senses, \"The searching out of their glory is a burden.\" So Delitzsch, by little manipulation of the pointing (כְּבֵרִם) obtains the rendering, \"But to search out hard things is an honour.\" Taken thus, the maxim says that bodily pleasures sicken and cloy, but diligent study brings honour. This, however, is not satisfactory; it gives a word two different senses in the same clause, and it affords a very feeble contrast. One would naturally expect the proverb to say that the excess, which was deprecated in the first hemistich as regards one department, must be equally rejected in another sphere. This is somewhat the idea given by Jerome, Sic qui scrutator est majestatis opprimetur a gloria. The truth here stated will be explained by translating our text, \"The investigation of weighty matters is a weight.\" Thus the clauses are shown to be well poised. Honey is good, study is good; but both may be used so as to be prejudicial. Eating may be carried to excess; study may attempt to investigate things too hard or too high. That this is a real danger we know well from the controversies about predestination and elation in time past, and those concerning spiritualism and theurgy in our own day (see Jeremy Taylor, 'Certainty of Salvation,' 3:176, edit. Hebrews; and 'Holy Living,' ch. 3, § 5). This is the view taken of the passage by St. Gregory ('Moral,' 14:32), 'If the sweetness of honey be taken in greater measure than there is occasion for, from the same source whence the palate is gratified, the life of the eater is destroyed.' The \"searching into majesty\" is also sweet; but he that seeks to dive into it deeper than the cognizance of human nature admits, finds the mere gloriousness thereof by itself oppresses him, in that, like honey taken in excess, it bursts the sense of the searcher which is not capable of holding it.\" And again (ibid., 20:18), \"For the glory of the invisible Creator, which when searched into with moderation lifts us up, being dived into beyond our powers bears us down\" (Oxford transl.). (Comp. Deuteronomy 29:29; Ecclus. 3:21, etc.) Septuagint, \"To eat much honey is not good, but it behoves us to honor glorious sayings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs25:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28 - A proverb like the last, concerned with self-control. In the Hebrew it runs thus (see on Ver. 11): A city that is broken down without wall - a man on whose spirit is no restraint. \"A city broken down\" is explained by the next words. \"without wall,\" and therefore undefended and open to' the first invader (comp. 2 Chronicles 32:5; Nehemiah 2:13). To such a city is compared the man who puts no restraint on his passions, desires, and affections; he is always in danger of being carried away by them and involved in sin and destruction; he has no defence when temptation assaults him, having lost self-control (comp. Proverbs 16:32). The old gnomes hold always true -NEWLINENEWLINEΘυμοῦ κρατῆσαι κἀπιθυμίας καλόν.NEWLINEDesire and passion it is good to rule.\"NEWLINENEWLINEΤαμιεῖον ἀρετῆς ἐστι σωφροσύνη μόνηNEWLINE\"Virtue's true storehouse is wise self-control.\" A Chinese maxim says. \"Who can govern himself is fit to govern the world.\" Septuagint, \"As a city whose wails are broken down and which is unwalled, so is a man who does aught without counsel.\" St. Jerome, by the addition of the words, in loquendo, applies the proverb to intemperance in language, \"So is he who is not able to restrain his spirit in speaking.\" Commenting on this, St. Gregory ('Moral,' 7:59) says, \"Because it is without the wall of silence, the city of the mind lies open to the darts of the enemy, and when it casts itself forth in words, it exhibits itself exposed to the adversary, and he gets the mastery of it without trouble, in proportion as the soul that he has to overcome combats against its own self by much talking\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - Certain proverbs concerning the fool (kesil), with the exception, perhaps, of ver. 2 (see on Proverbs 1:22). Verse 1. - As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest. Snow in summer would be quite unnatural and unheard of (see on Proverbs 25:13). Rain falls in the usual course of things only at stated times; whence arose the phrase of \"the early and of latter rains\" (see on Proverbs 16:15). From spring to October or November was the dry season, and a storm at harvest time was regarded, not merely as destructive or inconvenient, but as portentous and even supernatural (see 1 Samuel 12:17, etc.). The two cases are types of all that is incongruous and unsuitable. The LXX., apparently regarding their experience in Egypt rather than the actual text, translate, \"As dew in harvest, and as rain in summer.\" So honour is not seemly for a fool (ver. 8; Proverbs 19:10). It is quite out of place to show respect to a stupid and ungodly man, or to raise him to a post of dignity; such conduct will only confirm him in his folly, give others a wrong impression concerning him, and afford him increased power of mischief. The Greeks had a proverb about giving honour to unsuitable objects: they called it washing an ass's head with nitre.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying. \"Bird\" (tsippor) is the sparrow, which is found throughout Palestine; \"swallow\" (deror), the free flier. The Authorized Version hardly gives the sense. The line should be rendered, as the sparrow in (in respect of) its wandering, as the swallow in its flying. The point of comparison is the vagueness and aimlessness of the birds' flight, or the uselessness of trying to catch them in their course. So the curse causeless shall not come. It shall, as it were, spend its force in the air, and fall not on the head on which it was invoked. A causeless curse is that which is uttered against one who has done nothing to deserve such denunciation. Septuagint, \"As birds and sparrows fly, so a causeless (ματαία) curse shall come upon no one\" (comp. 1 Samuel 17:43; Nehemiah 13:2.) Bailey, 'Festus' -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Blessings star forth forever; but a curseNEWLINEIs like a cloud - it passes.\" Closely connected with the superstition that dreads a curse is that which is alarmed by omens. Against this irrational fear we find some Eastern proverbs directed; e.g., \"The jackal howls: will my old buffalo die?\" \"The dog barks - still the caravan passes: will the barking of the dog reach the skies?\" (Lane). Instead of ללֺא, \"not,\" the Keri reads לו, \"to him.\" This makes the proverb say that the unprovoked curse shall return upon him who uttered it. But this reading is not to be accepted, as it does not suit the terms of comparison, though it seems to have been used by St. Jerome, who translates, Sic maledictum frustra prolatum in quempiam superveniet. This retributive justice is often alluded to elsewhere; e.g., ver. 27 (where see note). So we find in various languages proverbs to the same effect. Thus in English, \"Harm watch, harm catch;\" Spanish, \"Who sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot;\" Turkish, \"Curses, like chickens, always come home to roost;\" Yoruba, \"Ashes always fly back in the face of him that throws them\" (Trench).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass. We should be inclined to invert the words, and say a bridle for the horse, and a whip for the ass; but it must be remembered that in early times the horse was not ridden, but only driven. The animals used in riding were the ass and mule, and sometimes the camel. The Eastern ass is really a fine animal, larger, more spirited, and more active than the poor creature which we are wont to see. Or the whip and bridle may be intended to apply to both animals, though divided between the two for rhythmical or antithetical reasons (see on Proverbs 10:1). A rod for the fool's back. Sharp correction is beth useful and necessary for the fool (so Proverbs 10:13; Proverbs 19:29). Similar treatment Siracides advises to be employed in the case of an idle servant (Ecclus. 30:24-28). Septuagint, \"As a whip for a horse and a goad for an ass, so is a rod for a lawless nation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnswer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Answer not a fool according to his folly. Do not lower yourself to the fool's level by answering his silly questions or arguing with him as if he were a sensible man. Lest thou also be like unto him; lest you be led to utter folly yourself or to side with him in his opinions and practices. Our blessed Saviour never responded to foolish and captious questions in the way that the questioner hoped and desired, he put them by or gave an unexpected turn to them which silenced the adversary.

The words, \"according to his folly,\" in this verse mean, as his folly deserves, in so plain a way as is expose it, and shame him, and bring him to a better mind.

This clause comes in the Hebrew after the next. Cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. To entrust an important commission to a fool is to deprive one's self of the means of having it properly executed, and to bring upon one's self shame and injury. A man who is so silly as to employ such an unfit messenger, as it were, cuts off the feet which should bear him on his errand, and, instead of enjoying the satisfaction of seeing the business well performed, he will be mortified and damaged by the blunder and stupidity of his emissary. Septuagint, \"He maketh for himself reproach from his own ways (ὁδῶν,? ποδῶν) who sendeth a word by a foulish messenger.\" The Vulgate reads the first participle in a passive sense, claudus pedibus; but this is uneccessary. We have similar phrases to \"drinketh damage\" elsewhere; e.g., Job 15:16 \"drinketh in iniquity;\" 34:7, \"drinketh up scorn;\" and with a different word, Proverbs 19:28, \"devoureth iniquity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The legs of a lame man are not equal. The first word of this verse, דַּלְיוּ, has occasioned some difficulty. It is considered as an imperative from דלה, \"draw off,\" \"take away.\" Thus the Septuagint, ἀφελοῦ; Venetian, ἐπάρατε. But the verb seems never to have this meaning; nor, if it had, would the sense be very satisfactory, for. as Delitzsch points out, lame legs are better than none, and there is a great difference between the perfectly crippled or paralytic who has to be carried, and the lame man (פִסֵּחַ) who can limp or get along on crutches., And when we explain the proverb in this sense (as Plumptre), \"Take away the legs of the lame man and the parable from the mouth of fools,\" for both alike ere useless to their possessors, and their loss would not be felt - we must recognize that the conclusion is not true. No one would think of amputating s man's legs simply because he was lame, and such a one's legs cannot be considered absolutely useless. Others regard the word as third plural kal, \"the legs hang loose;\" though the form is not sufficiently accounted for. All explanations of the word as a verbal form have such difficulties, that some take it as a noun, meaning \"dancing,\" which is Luther's interpretation, \"as dancing to a cripple, so it becometh a fool to talk of wisdom.\" But the word could never sightly anything but \"limping,\" and could not express the elegant motion of dancing. The Authorized Version considers the Hebrew to mean, \"are lifted up,\" i.e. are unequal, one being longer or stronger than the other; but this loses the force of the comparison. There seems to be no better interpretation than that mentioned above,\" The legs of the lame hang loose,\" i.e. are unserviceable, however sound in appearance. St. Jerome has expressed this, though in a strange fashion, \"As it is vain for a lame man to have seemly legs.\" So is a parable in the mouth of a fool. \"Parable\" (mashal), sententious saying, the enunciation of which, as well as the recital of stories, was always a great feature in Eastern companies, and afforded a test of a man's ability. A fool fails in the exhibition; he misses the point of the wise saying which he produces; it falls lame from his mouth, affords no instruction to others, and makes no way with its hearers. Siracides gives another reason for the incongruity, \"A parable shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in its season\" (Ecclus. 20:20). Septuagint, \"Take away the motion of legs, and transgression (παρανομίαν,? παροιμίαν, Lag.) from the mouth of fools.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - As he that bindeth a stone in a sling. So Septuagint, Ὅς ἀποδεσμέυει λίθον ἐν σφενδόνῃ. This gives a very good sense the point being either that the stone, after being firmly fitted in its place, quickly passes away from the sling, or, if more stress is laid on the word \"bindeth,\" that the stone is so firmly fixed that it cannot be slung, and therefore never reaches the mark. The alternative rendering adopted by the Revised Version is this, \"As a bag of gems in a heap of stones;\" where the incongruity would consist either in exposing jewels on a cairn, or sepulchral monument, whence they could easily be filched, or in attracting undesirable attention. But there are grammatical and etymological reasons against this interpretation; and the Authorized Version is to be considered correct. The Vulgate is curious: Sieur qui mittit lapidem in acervum Mercurii. This rendering points to the custom, with which Jerome must have been familiar, of erecting statues of Mercury on the highways, which were thus placed under his protection. Round these statues were ranged heaps of stones, to which every wayfarer contributed by throwing a pebble as he passed. The absence of the critical faculty which discerned no absurdity in this anachronism is sufficiently remarkable. The Latin saying seems intended to denote useless labour, as we speak of \"carrying coals to Newcastle.\" So is he that giveth honour to a fool. You pay respect to a fool, or place him in an honourable position, but your labour is wasted; he cannot act up to his dignity, he cannot maintain the honour; it passes away like the stone from the sling, or, if it remains, it is useless to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard. There is here no idea of the drunkard's hand being pierced with a thorn while he is insensible to the pain, but rather of his being armed with it, and ripe for mischief. So it is best to render, \"A thornbush cometh into the hand of a drunkard;\" he somehow gets possession of it, and in his stupid excitement is liable to become dangerous. Some understand עלה of the growth of the thorn; thus the Septuagint, \"Thorns grow in the hand of a drunkard;\" Vulgate, \"As if a thorn grew in the hand of a drunkard.\" But one does not see the bearing of such an expression; and the translation given above is more appropriate. So is a parable, etc. (as ver. 7). In that passage the wise saying in a fool's mouth was compared with something useless, here it is compared with something injurious. He employs it purposely to wound others; or by the ignorant use of some sharp-edged word he does much mischief. In this hemistich the LXX. has read משל with a different vocalization, and renders, \"servitude (δουλεία) in the hand of fools.\" This seems to mean that it comes natural to fools to be manacled and restrained by force.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Few passages have given greater difficulty than this verse; almost every word has been differently explained. The Authorized Version is, The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and re-wardeth transgressors; Revised Version, As an archer (Job 16:13) that woundeth all, so is he that hireth the fool and he that hireth thorn that pass by. At first sight one would hardly suppose that these could be versions of the same passage. To show the diversity that obtained in early times we quote the Greek and Latin versions. Septuagint, \"All the flesh of fools is much distressed (πολλὰ χειμάζεται), for their distraction (ἔκστασις) is brought to nought;\" Vulgate, \"Judgment decides causes, and he who imposes silence on a fool appeases wrath.\" From the various interpretations of which this proverb is capable, it may be surmised that it was originally one of those hard sayings which were intended to exercise the ingenuity of auditors. It has certainly had that effect in modern times. We may at once eliminate the rendering of the Authorized Version, though the sense is good and scriptural, denoting that the great Creator recompenses the good and punishes sinners. So the medieval jingle -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Ante Dei vultum nihil unquam restat inultum.\" God is not in the Hebrew, and rab, \"great,\" is never used absolutely as equivalent to \"God.\" Nor is the word used elsewhere to mean \"head workman;\" so the Revised Version margin, \"a master worker formeth all things,\" is suspicious. Some translate, \"A great man woundeth [equivalent to 'punisheth'] all; he renders their due to fools and to transgressors.\" One does not see why this should be attributed to the great man; it certainly is not generally true. Rosenmuller, \"The mighty man causes terror; so does he who hires the fool and the transgressor;\" but it is not clear why the hiring of a fool should occasion terror. The rendering in the Revised Version, or something very similar, has found favour with many modern commentators, though quite unknown to the mere ancient versions. According to this interpretation, the proverb says that a careless, random way of doing business, taking into one's service fools, or entrusting matters of importance to any chance loiterer, is as dangerous as shooting arrows about recklessly without caring whither they flew or whom they wounded. To this view Nowack objects that it is unparalleled to present an archer as a picture of what is unusual and profitless; that it does not explain why \"hireth\" is twice repeated; that the connection between shooter and the hire of fool and loiterer is net obvious; and that עברים does not mean \"vagabonds\" or \"passers by.\" None of these objections are of much importance; and this interpretation still holds its ground. There is also much to be said for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, which is virtually that of Gesenius, Fleischer, Wordsworth, Nutt, and others: A skilful man, a master workman, produces, makes, everything by his own care and superintendence; but he that hires a fool to do his work hires, as it were, any casual vagabond who may know nothing of the business. One objection to this interpretation is that the verb חולל, does not elsewhere have the meaning here attributed to it. Considering all the above interpretations unsatisfactory, Hitzig, after Umbreit, followed herein by Delitzsch and Nowack, translates, \"Much bringeth forth all,\" which means that he who possesses much can do anything, or, as St. Matthew 13:12, \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given\" (comp. Proverbs 1:5). But the second hemistich comes in rather lamely, \"But he who hires a fool is as one who hires a vagabond.\" Hence Delitzsch reads וּשְׂכַד for the first וְשכֵר, and renders, \"But the hire and the hirer of the fool pass away,\" i.e. what the fool gets as wages is soon squandered, and the person who took him into his service is ruined by his incapacity. In this case the connection of the two clauses would be this: A rich man, in the nature of things, grows richer; but there are exceptions to this rule; for he who employs stupid and incapable people to do his business suffers for it in property, reputation, and probably in person also; and the incompetent person derives no benefit from the connection. It is impossible to give a decided preference to any of these expositions; and the passage must be left as a crux. It is most probable that the Hebrew text is defective. This would account for the great variations in the versions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As the dog returneth to his vomit (see 2 Peter 2:22, which, however, is not quoted from the Septuagint), so a fool returneth to his folly; or, repeateth his folly. The fool never frees himself from the trammels of his foolishness; his deeds and words always bear the same character to the end. The same truth holds good of the sinner, especially the drunkard and the sensualist. If they feel temporary compunction, and reject their sin by partial repentance, they do not really shake it off wholly; it has become a second nature to them, and they soon relapse into it. Septuagint, \"As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes hateful, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin.\" The LXX. adds a distich which is found in Ecclus. 4:21, \"There is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? (Proverbs 3:7). Nothing so shuts the door against improvement as self-conceit. \"Woe unto them,\" says Isaiah (Isaiah 5:21), \"that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight.\" Such persons, professing themselves wise, become fools (Romans 1:22; Romans 12:16; Revelation 3:17, 18). Touching conceit, Qui sibi sapit, summe desipit. The Oriental speaks of the fox finding his shadow very large, and of the wolf when alone thinking himself a lion. There is more hope of a fool than of him (Proverbs 29:20). A fool who is conscious of unwisdom may be set right; but one who fancies himself perfect, and needing no improvement, is beyond cure; his case is hopeless. So the sinner who feels and acknowledges his iniquity may be converted; but the self-righteous Pharisee, who considers himself to have no need of repentance, will never be reformed (see Matthew Luke 15:7; Luke 18:14). St. Chrysostom (Hom. in Phil.,' 7), \"Haughtiness is a great evil; it is better to be a fool than haughty; for in the one case the folly is only a perversion of intellect, but in the other ease it is still worse; for it is folly joined with madness. The fool is an evil to himself; but the haughty man is a plague to others too. One cannot be haughty-minded without being a fool... The soul which is puffed up has a worse disease than dropsy, while that which is under restraint is treed from all evil\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-16. - Proverbs concerning the sluggard. Verse 13. - This is virtually the same as Proverbs 22:13. The words for \"lion\" are different in two parts of the verse, shakhal being the lion of advanced age, ari the full-grown animal; the latter may possibly be assumed to be the more dangerous of the two, and so a climax would be denoted. There is a proverb current in Bechuana, which says, \"The month of seed time is the season of headaches.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As the door turneth upon its hinges. The door moves on its hinges and makes no progress beyond its own confined sphere of motion; so the slothful man turns himself on his bed from side to side, but never leaves it to do his. work. Other analogies have been found in this proverb. Thus: The door opens to let the diligent go forth to his daily business, while the sluggard is rolling upon his bed; the door creaks when it is moved, so the lazy man groans when he is aroused; the door now is opened, now is shut, so the sluggard at one time intends to rise, and then falls back in his bed, and returns to his sleep (comp. Proverbs 6:9, 10; Proverbs 24:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Very nearly identical with Proverbs 19:24.

Wordsworth takes \"the dish\" as a type of sensual pleasure, which the slothful loves, while he has no liking for active work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit. The sluggard is here one who is too idle to think a matter out, and considers his own cursory view as sure to be right. He is one who deems study to be an unnecessary weariness of the flesh (Ecclesiastes 12:12), and flatters himself that he is quite able without it to give a satisfactory account of any question presented to him. Than seven men that can render a reason. \"Seven\" is the number of completeness (comp. Proverbs 6:31; Proverbs 9:1; Proverbs 24:16). The idle fool sets more value by his own judgment than by the sense of any number of wise men. Revised Version margin, \"that can answer discreetly,\" is perhaps nearer the Hebrew, which implies the being able to return a wise and proper answer to anything asked of them. The LXX. reading a little differently, renders, \"Wiser seems a sluggard to himself than one who in satiety (ἐν πλησμονῇ) brings back a message.\" This is explained to mean that a sluggard thinks himself wise in not helping a neighbour with an errand or a message, though he would have probably been repaid with a good dinner for his kindness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-28. - A series of proverbs connected more or less with peacefulness and its opposite. Verse 17. - He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him. \"Meddleth with strife\" should be \"vexes, excites himself, with a quarrel.\" Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears, and thus needlessly provokes him to bark and bite. Regarding the position of the two participles in this verse, without any connecting link, Delitzsch takes \"passing by\" as attributed to the dog, thus: \"He seizes by the ears a dog passing by, who is excited by a strife that concerns him not.\" The stray dog corresponds to the quarrel with which one has nothing to do. The present accentuation does not support this view; otherwise it is suitable and probable. Septuagint, \"As he who lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he who sets himself forth as champion in another's cause.\" Ecclus. 11:9, \"Strive not in a matter that concerns thee not.\" Says a Greek gnome -NEWLINENEWLINEΠολυπραγμονεῖν τὰλλότρια μὴ βοῦλου κακά Our English proverb says, \"He that intermeddles with all things may go shoe the goslings.\" The Telugu compares such interference to a monkey holding a snake in his paw; it is hard to hold, dangerous to let go (Lane).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19 - A tetrastich, but without parallelisms. As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death. The word rendered \"madman\" is an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, and has been variously explained; but the Authorized Version is probably correct. \"Firebrands\" are darts with some blazing material attached to them. \"Death \"forms a climax with the other dangers mentioned, which the madman deals forth recklessly and indiscriminately. So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? When a man has injured his neighbour by lies or malice, the plea that he was only in joke is not allowed; the injury is not less real because he excuses it by alleging it was done not seriously, but playfully; no more than the fatal effects of the use of murderous weapons are lessened by their being employed by the hands of a maniac. Practical joking is often a most serious matter. A mediaeval adage says wisely -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Cum jocus est verus, jocus est malus atque severus,\" Septuagint, \"Even as those who are under medical treatment (ἱώμενοι) throw words at men, and he who first meets the word will be overthrown; so are all they that lay wait for their own friends, and when they are seen, say, I did it in jest.\" As insane persons who abuse and ill treat their physicians are excused by reason of their infirmity, so those who injure friends in secret try to excuse themselves when found out by alleging that they were only joking.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Some proverbs follow concerning the slanderer.

So where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth; comes to silence (Proverbs 22:10). (For nirgan,\" whisper,\" see on Proverbs 16:28.)

The Hebrew denotes the comparison simply by position (see on Proverbs 25:11), thus: An earthen vessel (or, potsherd) overlaid with silver dross - growing lips and a wicked heart. So called \"silver dross\" is litharge, an oxide of lead used to this day to put a glaze on pottery (comp. Ecclus. 38:30). The comparatively worthless article is thus made to assume a fine appearance. Thus lips that seem to burn with affection, and give the kiss of glowing, love, may mask a heart filled with envy and hatred Judas kisses and words of friendship hide the bad feelings that lurk within. Septuagint, \"Silver given with guile is to be considered as a potsherd; smooth (λεῖα) lips hide a grievous heart\" (comp. Matthew 23:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He that hateth dissembleth with his lips. This and the next verse form a tetrastich. St. Jerome, Labiis suis intelligitur inimicus. But the verb here used, נכר, bears the meaning \"to make one's self unknown,\" as well as \"to make one's self known,\" and hence \"to make one's self unrecognizable\" by dress or change of countenance (1 Kings 14:5). This is much more appropriate in the present connection than the other explanation. The man cloaks his hatred with honeyed words. And layeth up deceit within him; meditating all the time treachery in his heart (Jeremiah 9:8). Septuagint, \"An enemy weeping promises all things with his lips, but in his heart he contriveth deceits.\" The tears in this case are hypocritical signs of sorrow, intended to deceive the dupe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs26:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - When he speaketh fair, believe him not. When he lowers his voice to a winning, agreeable tone, put no trust in him. Septuagint, \"If thine enemy entreat thee with a loud voice, be not persuaded.\" For there are seven abominations in his heart. His heart is filled with a host of evil thoughts (see on ver. 16), as if seven devils had entered in and dwelt there (Matthew 12:45; Mark 16:9). Ecclus. 12:10, etc. \"Never trust thine enemy; for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness. Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him.\" Plato's verdict concerning hypocrisy is often quoted, Ἐσχάτη ἀδικία δοκεῖν δίκαιον εϊναι μὴ ὄντα \"It is the very worst form of injustice to appear to be just without being so in reality\" ('De Rep.,' 2, p. 361, A).

He will show it before some third party and thus it will be divulged. At any rate, this will be the case at the judgment day, when he who hateth his brother shall be shown to be not only a murderer, but a hater of God also (1 John 3:15; 1 John 4:20).

This thought is found often elsewhere; e.g., Psalm 7:16; Psalm 9:16; Ecclesiastes 10:8; Ecclus. 27:25, 26. The pit is such a one as was made to catch wild animals; the maker is supposed to approach incautiously one of these traps, and to tall into it. And he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. This does not refer to throwing stones into the air, which fall upon the head of the thrower, but to rolling stones up a height in order to hurl them down upon the enemy (comp. Judges 9:53; 2 Samuel 11:21). Of such retributive justice we have numerous examples;e.g., Haman hung on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai (Esther 7:9, etc.). So the old story tells how Perillus, the inventor of the brazen bull in which prisoners were to be burned alive, was himself made to prove the efficacy of his own invention by the tyrant Phalaris; as Ovid saysNEWLINENEWLINE\"Et Phalaris tauro violenti membra PerilliNEWLINETorruit; infelix imbuit auctor opus.\"NEWLINE(Art.

St. Chrysostom speaks of the blindness of malice: \"Let us not plot against others, lest we injure ourselves. When we supplant the reputation of others, let us consider that we injure ourselves, it is against ourselves that we plot. For perchance with men we do him harm, if we have power, but ourselves in the sight of God, by provoking him against us. Let us not, then, injure ourselves.

There is a consensus of the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum to translate דכיו \"truth,\" thinking apparently of the Aramaean דַכְיָא \"that which is pure.\" But the hemistich would thus state the baldest truism, and modern commentators unite in assigning to the word some such sense as that given above in the Authorized Version. A liar shows his want of charity by slandering his neighbour; and that men dislike those whom they have injured is a common experience. \"It is a characteristic of human nature,\" says Tacitus ('Agric.,' 42), \"to hate those whom one has injured.\" Seneca, 'De Ira,' 2:83, \"Hoe habent pessimum animi magna fortuna insolentes, quos laeserunt, et oderunt.\" A flattering mouth worketh ruin; brings destruction on those who succumb to its seductive words. Vulgate, Os lubricum operatur ruinas; Septuagint, \"A mouth uncovered (ἄστεγον) causeth tumults.\" (For \"the smooth mouth,\" comp. ch. 5:3; Psalm 12:3; Psalm 55:21; Isaiah 30:10.) The word for \"tumults\" is ἀκαταστασίας, which does not occur elsewhere in the Septuagint, but is common in the New Testament; e.g., Luke 21:9; 1 Corinthians 14:33.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - These verses are grouped in pairs, each two being connected in subject.

The substantives are more forcible than the corresponding adjectives would be: the versions rather weaken the form of the expression by rendering, Grave est saxum, etc. The quality in the things mentioned is weight, heaviness, ponderosity; that is what we are bidden regard. A fool's wrath is heavier than them both. The ill temper and anger of a headstrong fool, which he vents on those about him, are harder to endure than any material weight is to carry. Ecclus. 22:15, \"Sand and salt and a mass of iron are easier to bear than a man without understanding.\" The previous verse asks, \"What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof [i.e. of the heavier thing], but a fool?\" Job speaks of his grief being heavier than the sand of the sea (Job 6:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous. Again substantives are used, as in ver. 3, \"Cruelty of wrath, and overflowing of anger.\" Figure to yourself the fierceness and cruelty of a sudden excitement of anger, or the bursting forth of passion which, like a flood, carries all before it; these may be violent for a time, yet they will subside when they have spent themselves. But who is able to stand before envy? or rather, jealousy. The reference is not so much to the general feeling of envy as to the outraged love in the relation of husband and wife (see Proverbs 6:34, and note there). Song of Solomon 8:6, \"Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very vehement flame.\" Such jealousy does not blaze forth in some sudden outbreak, and then die away; it lives and broods and feeds itself hourly with fresh aliment, and is ready to act at any moment, hesitating at no means to gratify itself, and sacrificing without mercy its victim. Septuagint, \"Pitiless is wrath, and sharp is anger; but jealousy (ζῆλος) submits to nothing.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOpen rebuke is better than secret love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Open rebuke is better than secret love. Love that is hidden and never discloses itself in acts of self-denial or generosity, especially that which from fear of offending does not rebuke a friend, nor speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15), when there is good reason for such openness - such disguised love is worse, more objectionable, less beneficial, than the plain speaking which bravely censures a fault, and dares to correct what is wrong by well-timed blame. To hold back blame, it has been said, is to hold back love. \"I love not my friend,\" wrote Seneca ('Ep.,' 25), \"if I do not offend him.\" Plautus, 'Trinum.,' 1:2, 57 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Sed tu ex amicis certis mi es certissimus.NEWLINENEWLINESi quid scis me fecisse inscite aut improbe,NEWLINESi id non me accusas, tu ipse objurgandus.\" Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 16, \"Amici vitia si feras, facis tua,\" which Erasmus expounds by adding, \"If you take no notice of your friend's faults, they will be imputed to you.\" Cicero ('De Amicit.,' 24, 25) has some sensible remarks on this subject: \"When a man's ears are shut against the truth, so that he cannot hear the truth from a friend, the welfare of such a one is hopeless. Shrewd is the observation of Cato, that some are better served by bitter enemies than by friends who seem to be agreeable; for the former often speak the truth, the latter never.... As therefore both to give and receive advice is the characteristic of true friendship, and that the one should act with freedom, but not harshly, and that the other should accept remonstrance patiently and without resistance, so it should be considered that there is no deadlier bane to friendship than adulation, fawning, and flattery.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFaithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Faithful are the wounds of friend. This and the next verse afford examples of the antithetic form of proverb, where the second line gives, as it were, the reverse side of the picture presented by the first. The wounds which a real friend inflicts by his just rebukes are directed by truth and discriminating affection (see Psalm 141:5). But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. So St. Jerome, Fraudulenta oscula odientis. But the verb here used (עתר) has the meaning, among others, \"to be abundant or frequent;\" hence it is better to take it in this sense here, as \"plentiful, profuse.\" An enemy is lavish with his Judas kisses to hide his perfidy and hatred. Septuagint, \"More to be trusted are the wounds of a friend than the spontaneous (ἑκούσια) kisses of an enemy.\" \"Non omnis qui parcia,\" wrote St. Augustine ('Ep.,' 48, 'ad Vincent.'), \"amicus est, neque omnis qui verberat, inimicus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The full soul loatheth an honeycomb. For \"loathes\" the Hebrew is literally \"treads upon,\" \"tramples underfoot,\" which is the expression of the greatest disgust and contempt; or it may mean that the well-fed man will not stoop to pick up the comb which may have dropped in his path from some tree or rock. But whichever way we take it, the same truth is told - Self-restraint increases enjoyment; over-iudulgence produces satiety, fatigue, and indolence. Horace, 'Sat.,' 2:2, 38 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Jejunus raro stomachus vulgaria temnit.\" But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. So the prodigal in the parable would fain fill himself with the husks which the swine did eat. So we say, \"Hunger is the best sauce;\" the Germans, \"Hunger makes raw beans sweet;\" and the Portuguese. \"Brackish water is sweet in a dry land.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - As a bird that wandereth from her nest. Jerome's avis transmigrans conveys to us a notion of a migratory bird taking its annual journey. But the idea here is of a bird which leaves its own nest either wantonly or from some external reason, and thereby exposes itself to d so comfort and danger (comp. Isaiah 16:2). So is a man that wandereth from his place; i.e. his own home (comp. Ecclus. 29:21, etc., and 36:28 in Vet. Lat., \"Quis credit ei qui non habet nidum, et deflectens ubicumque obscuraverit, quasi succinctus latro exsil ins de civitate in civitatem?\"). The proverb indirectly inculcates love of one's home and one's native land. To be \"a fugitive and a vagabond\" (Genesis 4:12) was a terrible punishment, as the Jews have learned by the experience of many centuries. Language and religion placed a barrier against residence in any country but their own (see Psalm 84.); and though at the time when this book was probably written they knew little of foreign travel, yet they regarded sojourn in a strange land as an evil, and centred all their ideas of happiness and comfort in a home life surrounded by friends and countrymen. The word \"wander\" may have the notion of going into exile. Septuagint, \"As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so is a man brought into bondage when he is banished (ἀποξενωθῇ) from his own place.\" Some have reasoned from this expression that the idea of exile had become familiar to the writer, and hence that this portion of the Proverbs is of very late origin (Cheyne) - surely a very uncertain foundation for such a conclusion. The love of Orientals for their native soil is a passion which no sordid and miserable surroundings can extinguish, and a man would consider even a change of home an unmixed evil, though such change was not the result of exile. Our view of the fortunes of one who is always shitting his abode is expressed in the adage, \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOintment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart. (For the use of unguents in the honourable treatment of guests, see Proverbs 7:16, etc.; Proverbs 21:17.) Similarly, perfumes prepared from spices, roses, and aromatic plants were employed; rooms were fumigated, persons were sprinkled with rose water, and incense was applied to the face and beard, as we read (Daniel 2:46) that Nebuchadnezzar ordered that to Daniel, in recognition of his wisdom, should be offered an oblation and sweet odours (see 'Dick of Bible,' and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' voc. \"Perfumes\"). The heat of the climate, the insalubrious character of the houses, the profuse perspiration of the assembled guests, rendered this attention peculiarly acceptable (comp. Song of Solomon 3:6). The LXX., probably with a tacit reference to Psalm 104:15, renders, \"The heart delighteth in ointments, and wines, and perfumes.\" So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. This is rather clumsy; the Revised Version improves it by paraphrasing, that cometh from hearty counsel. The meaning is that as ointment, etc., gladden the heart, so do the sweet and loving words of one who speaks from the depths of his soul. The idea is primarily of a friend who gives wise counsel, speaking the truth in love, or shows his approval by discreet commendation. The LXX. has pointed differently, and translates, \"But the soul is broken by calamities (καταῥῤήγνυται ὑπὸ (συμπτωμάτων);\" Vulgate, \"The soul is sweetened by the good counsels of a friend.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Another proverb, a tristich, in praise of friendship. It seems to be a combination of two maxims. Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not. A father's friend is one who is connected with a family by hereditary and ancestral bonds; φίλον πατρῷον. Septuagint. Such a one is to be cherished and regarded with the utmost affection. Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity. The tried friend is more likely to help and sympathize with you than even your own brother, for a friend is born for adversity, and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (Proverbs 17:17; Proverbs 18:24, where see notes). The mere blood relationship, which is the result of circumstances over which one has had no control, is inferior to the affectionate connection which arises from moral considerations and is the effect of deliberate choice. We must remember, too, that the practice of polygamy, with the separate establishments of the various wives, greatly weakened the tie of brotherhood. There was little love between David's sons; and Jonathan was far dearer to David himself than any of his numerous brothers were. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. \"Near\" and \"far off\" may be taken as referring to feeling or to local position. In the former case the maxim says that a neighbour who is really attached to one by the bonds of affection is better than the closest relation who has no love or sympathy. In the latter view, the proverb enunciates the truth that a friend on the spot in time of calamity is more useful than a brother living at a distance (μακρὰν οἰκῶν, Septuagint); one is sure of help at once from the former, while application to the latter must occasion delay, and may not be successful. Commentators quote Hesiod, Ἔργ. καὶ Ημ., 341 -NEWLINENEWLINEΤὸν δὲ μάλιστα καλεῖν ὅστις σέθεν ἐγγύθεναίειNEWLINEΑἰ γάρ τοι καὶ χρῆμ ἐγκώμιον ἄλλο γένηταιNEWLINEΓείτονες ἄζωστοι ἔκιον ζώσαντο δὲ πηοίNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My son, be wise, and make my heart glad. The exhortation of a father to his son, or of a teacher to his pupil. Such address is not found elsewhere in this latter portion of the book, though common in previous parts. Delitzsch translates, \"become wise.\" Σοφὸς γίνου, Septuagint. Such development of wisdom delights a father's heart, as Proverbs 10:1; Proverbs 23:15, 24. That I may answer him that reproacheth me (Psalm 119:42; comp. Psalm 127:5; Ecclus. 30:2). If the pupil did not show wisdom and morality in his conduct, the teacher would incur blame for the apparent failure of his education; whereas the high tone of the disciple might be appealed to as a proof of the merit and efficacy of the tutor's discipline. On the other hand, the evil doings of Hebrews often made the Name of God to be blasphemed among the Gentiles; just as nowadays the inconsistent lives of Christians are the greatest impediment to the success of missionary efforts in heathen countries. St. Jerome has, Ut possis exprobanti respondere sermonem. So Septuagint, \"And remove from thyself reproachful words.\" But the first person is in accordance with the Hebrew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A repetition of Proverbs 22:3.

What is meant is ostentatious salutation, which puts itself forward in order to stand well with a patron, and to be beforehand with other servile competitors for favour. Juvenal satirized such parasitical effusion ('Sat.' 5:19) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Habet Trebius, propter quod rumpere somnumNEWLINEDebeat et ligulas dimittere, sollicitus, neNEWLINETots salutaris jam turba peregerit orbem,NEWLINESideribus dubiis, aut illo tempore, quo seNEWLINEFrigida circumagunt pigri surraca Bootae.\" The \"loud voice\" intimates the importunate nature of such public trumpeting of gratitude, as the \"rising early\" denotes its inopportune and tactless insistency, which cannot wait for a convenient opportunity for its due expression. It shall be counted a curse to him. The receiver of this sordid adulation, and indeed all the bystanders, would just as soon be cursed by the parasite as blessed in this offensive manner, This clamorous outpouring of gratitude is not accepted as a return by the benefactor; he sees the mean motives by which it is dictated self-interest, hope of future benefits - and he holds it as cheap as he would the curses of such a person. The nuisance of such flattery is mentioned by Euripides, 'Orest.,' 1161 -NEWLINENEWLINEΠαύσομαί σ αἰνῶν ἐπεὶNEWLINEΒάρος τι κὰν τῷ δ ἐστὶν αἰνεῖσθαι λίαν. Duo sunt genera prosecutorum, says St. Augustine ('In Psalm.,' 69), \"sciliet vituperantium et adulantium; sed plus prosequitur lingua adulatoris, quam manus prosecutoris.\" \"Woe unto you,\" said Christ (Luke 6:26), \"when all men shall speak well of you.\" \"Do I seek to please men?\" asked St. Paul (Galatians 1:10); \"for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.\" Vers. 15 and 16 form a tetrastich on the subject of the termagant wife.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The single line of the second clause of Proverbs 19:13 is here formed into a distich. A continual dropping in a very rainy day. \"A day of violent rain,\" סַגְרִיר (sagrir), which word occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament. And a contentious woman are alike. The word rendered \"are alike\" (נִשְׁתָּוָה) is usually taken to be the third perf. nithp. from שׁיה; but the best established reading, according to Hitzig, Delitzsch, and Nowack, is נִשְׁתָּוָה, which is regarded as a niph. with a transposition of consonants for נְשְׁוָתָה. Septuagint, \"Drops of rain drive a man out of his house on a stormy day.\" The ill-constructed roofs of Eastern houses were very subject to leakage, being flat and formed of porous material.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind. Whoever tries to restrain a shrewish woman, or to conceal her faults, might as well attempt to confine the wind or to check its violence. And the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. He might as well try to hide the ointment which signifies its presence by its odour. But there is no \"which\" in the original, which runs literally, \"his right hand calls oil,\" or, \"oil meets his right hand.\" The former is supposed to mean that he is hurt in the struggle to coerce the vixen, and needs ointment to heal his wound; but the latter seems the correct rendering, and the meaning then is that, if he tries to hold or stop his wife, she escapes him like the oil which you try in vain to keep in your hand. An old adage says that there are three things which cannot be hidden, but always betray themselves, viz. a woman, the wind, and ointment. The LXX. has read the Hebrew differently, translating, \"The northwind is harsh, but by name it is called lucky (ἐπιδέξιος);\" i.e. because it clears the sky and introduces fine weather. The Syriac, Aquila, and Symmachus have adopted the same reading.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Iron sharpeneth iron. The proverb deals with the influence which men have upon one another. So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. So the Vulgate, Homo exacuit faciem amici sui. The action of the file is probably meant (1 Samuel 13:21); and the writer names iron as the sharpener rather than the whetstone, because he wishes to denote that one man is of the same nature as another, and that this identity is that which makes mutual action possible and advantageous. Some have taken the proverb in a bad sense, as if it meant that one angry word leads to another, one man's passion excites another's rage. Thus Aben Ezra. The Septuagint perhaps supports this notion by rendering, Ἀνὴρ δὲ παροξύνει πρόσωπον ἑταίρου. But the best commentators understand the maxim to say that intercourse with other men influences the manner, appearance, deportment, and character of a man, sharpens his wits, controls his conduct, and brightens his very face. Horace uses the same figure of speech, 'Ars Poet.,' 304 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Fungar vice cotis, acutumNEWLINEReddere quae ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secaudi.\" On the subject of mutual intercourse Euripides says, 'Androm.,' 683 -NEWLINENEWLINEἩ δ ὁμυλίαNEWLINEΠάντων βροτοῖσι γίγνεται διδάσκαλοςNEWLINENEWLINE\"CompanionshipNEWLINEIs that which teaches mortals everything.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof. He who watches, tends, and cultivates the fig tree will in due time have the reward of his labour in eating its fruit. The abundance of the produce of this tree makes it a good figure of the reward of faithful service. Septuagint, \"He that planteth a fig tree shall eat the fruits thereof\" (2 Timothy 2:6). So he that waiteth on his maser shall be honoured. He who pays attention, has loving regard to his master, shall meet with honour as his reward at his master's hands, and also from all who become acquainted with his merits. The gnome may well be applied to the case of those who do true and laudable service to their heavenly Master, and she shall one day hear from his lips the gracious word, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\" (Matthew 25:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man; Vulgate, Quomodo in aquis resplendent vultus prospicientium, sic corda hominum manifesta sunt prudentibus. As in clear water the face of the gazer is reflected, so man finds in his fellow man the same feelings, sentiments, passions, which he has himself. He sees in others the likeness of himself; whatever he knows himself to be, he will see others presenting the same character. Self-knowledge, too, leads to insight into others' minds; \"for what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?\" (1 Corinthians 2:11). There is a solidarity in human nature which enables us to judge of others by ourselves. The difficulties in the construction and wording of the sentence do not affect the interpretation. They are, however, best met by rendering, with Delitzsch, \"As it is with water, face corresponds to face, so also the heart of man to man.\" Septuagint, \"As faces are not like faces, so neither are the thoughts of men;\" which is like the saying of Persius, 'Sat.,' 5:52 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Mille hominum species, et rerum discolor usus;NEWLINEVelle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur uno.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Hell and destruction are never full. \"Hell\" is sheol, the under-world, Hades, the place of the departed; \"destruction\" is the great depth, the second death, personified (see on Proverbs 15:11, where the terms also occur). These \"are never satisfied,\" they are insatiable, all-devouring (comp. Proverbs 30:16; Isaiah 5:14; Habakkuk 2:5). So the eyes of man are never satisfied. The verb is the same in both clauses, and ought to have been so translated. The eye is taken as the representative of concupiscence in general. What is true of \"the lust of the eyes\" (1 John 2:16) is true of all the senses; the craving for their gratification grows as it is fed. Therefore the senses should be carefully guarded, lest they lead to excess and transgression. \"Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity,\" said the psalmist, \"and quicken me in thy way\" (Psalm 119:37). The LXX. here introduces a paragraph not in the Hebrew or the Latin Versions: \"He that fixes (στηρίζων) his eye [i.e. staring impudently] is an abomination to the Lord, and the uninstructed restrain not their tongue.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Fining pot, etc. (see on Proverbs 17:3; comp. also Proverbs 25:4). So is a man to his praise. The Hebrew is literally, The crucible for silver, and the furnace for gold, and a man according, to his praise; i.e. as the processes of metallurgy test the precious metals, so a man's public reputation shows what he is really worth, as is stated in Proverbs 12:8. As the crucible brings all impurities to the surface, so public opinion drags forth all that is bad in a man, and he who stands this test is generally esteemed. Certainly praise is a stimulus to exertion, an incentive to try to make one's self worthy of the estimation in which one is held, especially if he purifies it from the dross and earthliness mixed with it, and takes to himself only what is genuine and just. But public opinion is very commonly false end is always a very unsafe criterion of moral excellence. Hence other interpretations have been proposed. Ewald renders, \"and a man according to his boasting,\" that is, according to that which he most praises in himself and others. So virtually Hitzig, Bottcher, Zockler, and others. In this view the gnome denotes that a man's real character is best examined by the light cast upon it by his usual line of thought, what he most prides himself upon, what he admires most in other men. Plumptre, after Gesenius and Fleischer, has, \"So let a man be to his praise,\" i.e. to the mouth which praises him; let him test this commendation, to see what it is worth, before he accepts it as his due. The explanation first given seems on the whole most suitable, when we reflect that the highest morality is not always enunciated, and that secondary motives are widely recognized as factors in action and judgment. There are not wanting men in modern days who uphold the maxim, Vox populi, vox Dei. Septuagint, \"The action of fire is a test for silver and gold, so a man is tested by the mouth of them that praise him.\" No surer test of a man's true character can be found than his behaviour under praise; many men arc spoiled by it. If a man comes forth from it without injury, not rendered vain, or blind to his defects, or disdainful of others, his disposition is good, and the commendation lavished upon him may be morally and spiritually beneficial. Vulgate, Sic probatur homo ore laudantis, \"So is a man proved by the mouth of him that praises him.\" The following passage from St. Gregory, commenting on this, is worth quoting, \"Praise of one's self tortures the just, but elates the wicked. But while it tortures, it purifies the just; and while it pleases the wicked, it proves them to be reprobate. For these revel in their own praise, because they seek not the glory of their Maker. But they who seek the glory of their Maker are tortured with their own praise, lest that which is spoken of without should not exist within them; lest, if that which is said really exists, it should be made void in the sight of God by these very honours; lest the praise of men should soften the firmness of their heart, and should lay it low in self-satisfaction; and lest that which ought to aid them to increase their exertions, should be even now the recompense of their labour. But when they see that their own praises tend to the glory of God, they even long for and welcome them. For it is written, \"That they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" ('Moral.,' 26:62, Oxford transl.). The LXX. adds a verse which is not found in the Hebrew, but occurs in some manuscripts of the Latin Version, \"The heart of the transgressor seeketh out evils, but an upright heart seeketh knowledge.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle. \"To bray\" is to pound or beat small. \"Wheat,\" רִיפות, riphoth (only in 2 Samuel 17:19), \"bruised corn.\" Vulgate, In pila quasi ptisanas (barley groats) feriente; Aquila and Theodotion, Ἐν μέσῳ ἐμπτισσομένων \"In the midst of grains of corn being pounded.\" The LXX., reading, differently, has, \"Though thou scourge a fool, disgracing him (ἐν μεσῳ συνεδρίου) in the midst of the congregation.\" Of course, the process of separating the husks from the corn by the use of pestle and mortar is much more delicate and careful than threshing in the usual clumsy way; hence is expressed the idea that the most elaborate pains are wasted on the incorrigible fool (see on Proverbs 1:20). His foolishness will not depart from him. An obstinate, self-willed, unprincipled man cannot be reformed by any means; his folly has become a second nature, and is not to be eliminated by any teaching, discipline, or severity. There is, too, a judicial blindness, when, after repeated warnings wilfully rejected and scorned, the sinner is left to himself, given over to a reprobate mind \"Whoso teacheth a fool,\" Siracides pronounces, \"is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep\" (Ecclus. 22:7). Again, \"The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth\" (Ecclus. 21:14). In Turkey, we are told, great criminals were beaten to pieces in huge mortars of iron, in which they usually pounded rice. \"You cannot straighten a dog's tail, try as you may,\" says a Telugu maxim (Lane). There is a saying of Schiller's which is quite proverbial, \"Heaven and earth fight in vain against a dunce.\" Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:10, 24 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret.\" Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 13:239 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Tamen ad mores natura recurritNEWLINEDamnatos, fixa et mutari nescia.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-27. - A mashal ode in praise of a pastoral and agricultural life. The moralist evidently desires to recall his countrymen from the luxury of cities and the temptations of money making to the simple ways of the patriarchs and the pleasures of country pursuits - which are the best foundation of enduring prosperity. Verse 23. - Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks. \"State;\" פָנִים (panim); vultum, Vulgate; the face, look, appearance. The LXX. has ψυχάς, which may perhaps mean \"the number\" - a necessary precaution when the sheep wandered on the downs and mountains, and had to be collected in the evening and folded. These precepts are naturally applied to all rulers, and especially to Christian pastors who have the oversight of the flock of Christ (1 Peter 5:2-4). Ecclus. 7:22, \"Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them; and if they he for thy profit, keep them with thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24 - For riches are not forever; as Proverbs 23:5. Money and other kinds of wealth may be lost or wasted; it is therefore expedient to have the resources of agriculture, land and herds, to depend upon. Chosen (Proverbs 15:6), translated \"riches,\" is \"strength,\" \"abundance,\" \"treasure laid up.\" Delitzsch renders, \"prosperity;\" Septuagint, \"A man has not strength and power forever;\" Vulgate, Non habebis jugiter potestatem, i.e. \"you will not always be able to tend your flocks; infirmity and old age will prevent you.\" And doth the crown endure to every generation? The crown or diadem, נֵזֶר (nezer), is the symbol of royal authority, or of the highest dignity of the priesthood (Exodus 29:6; Exodus 39:30). These positions are not secure from generation to generation; much less stable, in fact, than the possession of farms and cattle. St. Jerome, Sed corona tribuetur in generationem et generationem, where corona is the headship of the family. Septuagint, \"Neither doth he transmit it (his strength) from generation to generation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - As ver. 23 commended the rearing of cattle, and ver. 24 supported the injunction by showing its comparative permanence, so this and the following verses discuss the material advantages of such occupation. The hay appeareth; rather, the grass passeth away, is cut and carried. This is the first stage in the agricultural operations described. And the tender grass showeth itself; the aftermath appears. And the herbs of the mountain are gathered; the fodder from off the hills is cut and stored. All these verbs are best taken hypothetically, the following verses forming the apodosis. When all these operations are complete, then crone the results in plenty and comfort. Septuagint, \"Have a care of the herbage (χλωρῶν) in the plain, and thou shalt cut grass, and gather thou the mountain hay.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The Iambs are for thy clothing. Thy sheep will provide thee with clothing by their skin and wool, and by the money which thou wilt obtain by the sale of them. The goats are the price of the field; the sale of thy goats and their produce will pay for thy field if thou wish to buy it (see on Proverbs 30:31). Septuagint, \"That thou mayest have sheep for clothing; honour thy land that thou mayest have lambs.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs27:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Goats' milk. Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 1:311) notes that in most parts of Palestine goats' milk in every form - sour, sweet, thick, thin, warm, or cold - makes, with eggs and bread, the main food of the people. And maintenance for thy maidens; who milk the goats, etc., and tend the cattle, and do the household work. There is no mention of the use of animal flesh as food. It was only on great occasions, as high festivals, or the presence of an honoured guest, that kids, lambs, and calves were killed and eaten. This picture of rural peace and plenty points to a time of security and prosperity, free alike from internal commotion and external danger. The famous passage in Cicero, 'De Senect.,' 15, on the pleasures and advantages of the agricultural life. will occur to all classical readers. So also Horace ('Epod.,' 2), \"Beatus ille qui procul negotiis,\" etc. The LXX. makes short work of this verse, \"My son, thou hast from me sayings mighty for thy life and for the life of thy servants.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The wicked flee when no man pursueth. The unreasoning terror of the sinner arises partly from his uneasy conscience, which will not permit him to transgress without warning of consequences, and partly from the judgment of God, according to the threats denounced in Leviticus 26:36, 37. A terrible picture of this instinctive fear is drawn in Job 15:20, etc., Cand Wisd. 17:9, etc. There are numerous proverbs about unreasonable timidity, such as being afraid of one's own shadow (see Erasmus, 'Adag.,' s.v. \"Timiditas\"). As the Eastern puts it, \"The leaf cracked, and your servant fled;\" and \"Among ten men nine are women\" (Lane). On the cowardice of sinners St. Chrysostom says well, \"Such is the nature of sin, that it betrays while no one finds fault; it condemns whilst no one accuses; it makes the sinner a timid being, one that trembles at a sound; even as righteousness has the contrary effect How doth the wicked flee when no man pursueth? He hath that within which drives him on, an accuser in his own conscience, and this he carries about everywhere; and just as it would be impossible to flee from himself, so neither can he escape the persecutor within, but wherever he goeth he is scourged, and hath an incurable wound\" ('Hom. in Stat.,' 8:3, Oxford transl.). But the righteous are hold as a lion. They are undismayed in the presence of danger, because their conscience is at rest, they know that God is on their side, and, whatever happens, they are safe in the everlasting arms (see Psalm 91.). Thus David the shepherd boy quailed not before the giant (1 Samuel 17:32, etc.), remembering the promise in Leviticus 26:7, 8. The heathen poet Horace could say of the upright man ('Carm.,' 3:3, 7) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Si fractus illabatur orbis,NEWLINEImpavidum ferient ruinae.\" Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his Hope (Ecclus. 31 (34):14, etc.). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 31:55, \"The lion is not afraid in the onset of beasts, because he knows well that he is stronger than them all. Whence the fearlessness of a righteous man is rightly compared to a lion, because, when he beholds any rising against him, he returns to the confidence of his mind, and knows that he overcomes all his adversaries because he loves him alone whom he cannot in any way lose against his will. For whoever seeks after outward things, which are taken from him even against his will, subjects himself of his own accord to outward fear. But unbroken virtue is the contempt of earthly desire, because the mind is both placed on high when it is raised above the meanest objects by the judgment of its hopes, and is the less affected by all adversities, the more safely it is fortified by being placed on things above\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof. This implies that the wickedness of a nation is punished by frequent changes of rulers, who impose new laws, taxes, and other burdens, which greatly oppress the people; but regarding the antithesis in the second hemistich, we take the meaning to be that when iniquity, injustice, apostasy, and other evils abound, a country becomes the prey of pretenders and partisans striving for the supremacy. The history of the northern kingdom of Israel, especially in the disastrous period succeeding the death of Jeroboam II, affords proof of the truth of the statement (comp. Hosea 8:4). Septuagint, \"Owing to the sins of ungodly men, quarrels (κρίσεις, lawsuits) arise.\" But by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. \"The state\" is the stability, the settled condition of the country. The word is כֵן (ken), here a substantive, equivalent to \"station,\" \"base.\" Umbreit, Nowack, and others translate it, \"justice,\" \"authority,\" \"order.\" When a wise and religious man is at the helm of state, justice continues, lives, and works; such a man introduces an clement of enduring good into a land (comp. Proverbs 21:22; Ecclesiastes 9:15). The good kings Ass, Jehoshaphat, Uzziah, and Hezekiah had long and prosperous reigns. Septuagint, \"But a clever man (πανοῦργος) will quench them (quarrels).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A poor man that oppresseth the poor. The words rendered \"poor\" are different. The former is rash, \"needy,\" the latter dal, \"feeble\" (see on Proverbs 10:15). Delitzsch notes that, in accordance with the accents in the Masoretic text, we should translate, \"A poor man and an oppressor of the lowly - a sweeping rain without bringing bread,\" which would mean that a tyrant who oppresses the lowly bears the same relation to the poor that a devastating rain does to those whom it deprives of their food. But it is pretty certain that \"the poor\" and \"the oppressor\" designate the same person (though the vocalization is against it); hence the gnome refers to a usurper who, rising to power from poor estate, makes the very worst and most tyrannical ruler. Such a one has learned nothing from his former condition but callous indifference, and now seeks to exercise on others that power which once galled him. Thus among schoolboys it is found that the greatest bully is one who has himself been bullied; and needy revolutionists make the most rapacious and iniquitous demagogues. Of such tyrants the prophets complain (see Isaiah 5:8, etc.; Micah 2:2). Wordsworth refers, as an illustration, to Catiline and his fellow conspirators, who were moved by selfish interests to overthrow the commonwealth. Many modern commentators (e.g., Hitzig, Delitzsch, Nowack), in view of the present text, regarding the combination נבר רשׁ, and noting that elsewhere the oppressor and the poor are always introduced in opposition (comp. Proverbs 29:13), read רלֺאשׁ, or consider רשׁ as equivalent to it - rosh, \"the head,\" in the signification of \"master,\" \"ruler.\" The gnome thus becomes concinnous, the ruler who ought to benefit his dependents, but injures them, corresponding to the rain which, instead of fertilizing, devastates the crops. The LXX. had a different reading, as it readers, \"A bold man in his impieties (ἀνδρεῖος ἐν ἀσεβείαις) calumniates the poor.\" Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food; literally, and not bread. A violent storm coming at seed time and washing away soil and seed, or happening at harvest time and destroying the ripe corn. Vulgate, Similis est imbri vehementi, in quo paratur fames. Ewald supposes that such proverbs as these and the following belong to the time of Jeroboam II, when the prosperity of the people induced luxury and arrogance, and was accompanied with much moral evil, oppression, and perversion of justice ('Hist. of Israel,' 3:126, Eng. transl.). The Bengalee compares the relation of the rich oppressor to the poor, not with the rainstorm, but with that of the carving knife to the pumpkin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They that forsake the Law praise the wicked. This they do because they love iniquity, and like to see it extend its influence, and arm itself against the good, who are a standing reproach to them. St. Paul notes it as a mark of extreme wickedness that gross sinners \"not only do the same iniquities, but have pleasure in them that do them\" (Romans 1:32). Such as keep the Law contend with them; are angry with them. They are filled with righteous indignation; they cannot hold their peace when they see God's Law outraged, and must have the offenders punished (comp. 1 Kings 19:14; Psalm 74:11. etc.; Psalms 119:136, 139; 139:21). The LXX. connects this verse with the latter part of the preceding, thus: \"As an impetuous and profitless rain, thus those who forsake the Law praise ungodliness; but they who love the Law raise a wall around themselves.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Evil men understand not judgment; or, what is right. An evil man's moral conception is perverted, he cannot distinguish between right and wrong; the light that was in him has become darkness (comp. Proverbs 29:7). Many men, by giving themselves over to wickedness, awe judicially blinded, according to John 12:89, 40. They who seek the Lord understand all things. These who do God's will, seeking him in prayer, know what is morally right is every circumstance, have a right judgment in all things (comp. Ecclesiastes 8:5; 1 Corinthians 2:15). So 1 John 2:20, \"Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things;\" and our Lord has (declared, \"If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine\" (John 7:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBetter is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This is almost the same as Proverbs 19:1, but varies a little in the second hemistich: than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. The Hebrew literally is, perverse of two ways; i.e. who, going one way, pretends to go another; the \"two ways\" being the evil which he really pursues, and the good which he feigns to follow. Delitzsch calls him \"a double-going deceiver.\" So Siracides imprecates, \"Woe to the sinner that goeth two ways\" (Ecclus. 2:12). \"A double-minded man,\" says St James (James 1:8), \"is unstable in all his ways.\" It is not the endeavouring to serve God and mammon at the same time that is meant, but putting on the appearance of religion to mask wicked designs - in the present case in order to gain wealth. Septuagint, \"A poor man walking in truth is better than a rich liar.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Whoso keepeth the Law is a wise son. \"Law\" is torah, as ver. 4; but it seems here to include not only the Decalogue, but also the father's instruction and commands. Such an obedient and prudent son brings honour and joy to a parent's heart (see Proverbs 10:1; Proverbs 29:3). He that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father; literally, he that feedeth, hath fellowship with, gluttons (Proverbs 23:20). The son who herds with debauchers, and wastes his substance in riotous living, brings shame on, wounds, and insults, all connected with him. Such a one transgresses the Law and his father's commands, and brings them into contempt (comp. Proverbs 27:11). Hence the antithesis of the two clauses. Septuagint, \"He that cherishes debauchery (ποιμαίνει ἀσωτίαν) dishonours his father.\" Ἀσωτία occurs only in 2 Macc. 6:4, but is common in the New Testament; e.g., Ephesians 5:18; Titus 1:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance. \"Usury\" (neshek) is interest on money lent taken in money; \"unjust gain\" (tarbith) is interest taken in kind, as if a man, having lent a bushel of corn, exacted two bushels in return. All such transactions were forbidden by the Law of Moses, at any rate between Israelites (see Leviticus 25:36, 37, \"Thou shalt not give thy brother thy money upon usury (neshek), nor lend him thy victuals for increase [marbith, equivalent to tarbith, which is used in ver. 36] \"). Septuagint, Μετὰ τόκων καὶ πλεονασμῶν, \"With interest and usury.\" (For censure of usury, see Psalm 109:11; Ezekiel 18:13; and, contrast Psalm 15:5; Ezekiel 18:8.) He shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. He shall never enjoy it himself, and shall fall into the hands of one who will hake a better use of it (see on Proverbs 22:16; and comp Proverbs 13:22; Job 27:16, etc.). In our Lord's parable the pound is taken from one who made no good use of it and is given to a more profitable servant (Luke 19:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law. He who refuses to hearken to and to practise the dictates of the Divine law (comp Proverbs 1:20. Even his prayer shall be abomination (comp. Proverbs 15:8, and note there). \"God heareth not sinners\" (John 9:31). Such a man's prayer, if he does pray, is not hearty and sincere, and therefore, lacks the element which alone can make it acceptable. He will not resolve to forsake his favourite sin, even while paying outward worship to the God whoso Law he breaks: what wonder that the prophet so sternly denounces such offenders (Isaiah 1:11. etc.), and the psalmist cries with terrible rigour, \"When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin\" (Psalm 109:7)? St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 10:27), \"Our heart blames us in offering up our prayers, when it calls to mind that it is set in opposition to the precepts of him whom it implores, and the prayer becomes abomination, when there is a 'turning away' from the control of the Law; in that wrily it is meet that a man should be a stranger to the favours of him to whose bidding he will not be subject.\" And again (ibid., 18:9, 10), \"If that which he bids we do, that which we ask we shall obtain. For with God both these two do of necessity match with one another exactly, that practice should be sustained by prayer, and prayer by practice\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A tristich. Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way. It is doubtful whether physical danger or moral seduction is meant. The gnome is true in either case; he who mishads one who trusted him, and who, being simple and good, ought to have been respected and to have received better treatment, shall fall into the destruction which he prepared for the other (Proverbs 26:27). Taking the proverb in a moral sense, we find this truth: If the good man does ever yield to the temptations of the sinner, the latter does not reap the enjoyment which he expected from the other's lapse, rather he is made twofold more the child of hell, he himself sinks the deeper and more hopelessly for playing the devil's pert, while the just rises from hi. temporary fall morn humble, watchful, and guarded for the future. But the upright shall have good things in possession; or, shall inherit good (Proverbs 3:35). He shall be abundantly rewarded by God's grace and protection, by the comfort of a conscience at rest, and by prosperity in his worldly concerns - an adumbration of the eternal recompense awaiting him in the life to come. St. Jerome has changed the incidence of the gnome by inserting ejus, thus: Et simplices possidebunt bona ejus, which makes the meaning to be that the righteous shall be the instruments of retribution on the deceiver, whose riches shall pass over into their possession. But the Hebrew gives no countenance to this interpretation. Septuagint, \"The transgressors shall pass by good things, and shall not enter into them,\" where the translator has misunderstood the original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The rich man is wise in his own conceit (comp. Proverbs 18:11). A rich man thinks so highly of his position, is so flattered by parasites, and deems himself placed so immeasurably above social inferiors, that he learns to consider himself possessed of other qualifications, even mental and intellectual gifts, with which wealth has no concern. This purse-proud arrogance which looks upon financial skill and sharpness in bargaining as true wisdom, is confined to no age or country. But the poor man that hath understanding searcheth him out (Proverbs 18:17). Wisdom is not to be bought with money. A poor man may be wise, his poverty probably making him a keener critic; and if he is brought into communication with this self-deluding plutocrat, he soon sees through him and recognizes his real value. Septuagint, \"An intelligent poor man will condemn him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory (comp. Proverbs 29:2; Proverbs 11:10). \"Rejoice,\" rather triumph, as conquerors, right prevailing and wickedness being overcome. Then there is great show of joy, and, as the expression implies, men put on their festal garments to do honorer to the occasion: See the description of Solomon's time (1 Kings 4:20, 25). If we take this verse in connection with ver. 2, we may see in it the triumph of order after a period of confusion and anarchy. Septuagint, \"Through the help of righteous men great glory arises.\" But when the wicked rise, a man is hidden (comp. ver. 28, where, however, the verb is different). The Authorized Version m, one that when the wicked rise to power, people have to hide themselves in order to escape danger to life and property. The verb is more literally rendered, \"are searched for,\" i.e. they have betaken themselves to hiding places, and have to be looked for; they fear oppression and injury, and venture no longer into the streets and open places. Vulgate,Regnantibus impiis ruinae hominum, \"When evil men are m power, there is general ruin;\" Septuagint, \"In the places of the ungodly men are caught.\" Other interpretations of the proverb have been suggested, though none is so satisfactory as that given above. Thus some take the searching out to mean testing, in the sense that evil times try men's characters, and bring out their true nature (1 Corinthians 11:19). Others explain that, under the reign of the impious, men do not come forward to take part in public affairs, but retire sullenly into private life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He that covereth his sins shall not prosper. To cover one's sins is either absolutely to disown them or to make excuses; a man who does this is never free from a burden of guilt, as the psalmist says, \"When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me\" (Psalm 32:3, etc.). Whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Confession alone without amendment, or what is called theologically satisfaction, does not win pardon and mercy. It is when the sinner acknowledges his transgression, and turns from it to newness of life, that God heals his backsliding, and turns away his auger and renews the tokens of his love (Hosea 14:4). Confession is made to God, against whom all sin is committed (Joshua 7:19; Job 31:33; 1 John 1:8, etc.): and to man, if one has transgressed against him, or if he be in a position to give spiritual counsel. Thus the people confessed their sins before John the Baptist (Matthew 3:6) and the apostles (Acts 19:18; comp. James 5:16). Among the Jews, the high priest, acting as the mouthpiece of the people on the great Day of Atonement, confessed their iniquities, laying them on the scapegoat; and particular confession was also enjoined, and was part of the ritual accompanying a sacrifice for sin, by which legal purification was obtained (Numbers 5:6, 7, \"When a man or woman shall commit any sin... then they shall confess their sin which they have done;\" so Leviticus 5:5). And the very offering of a trespass offering was a public recognition of guilt, which was exhibited by the offerer laying his hand on the head of the victim (Leviticus 1:4). Such confession is spoken of strongly by Siracides, \"Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, and force not the course of the river\" (Ecclus. 4:26); i.e. do not attempt the impossible task of trying to hide them. The LXX. has, \"He who sets forth accounts ἐξηγούμενος ἐλέγχους i.e. blames himself) shall be loved.\" Lesetre quotes Sedulius, 'Carm.

Some have taken the fear mentioned to be the fear with which God is to be regarded. Thus Aben Ezra. But it is rather the fear of sin which is meant - that tender conscience and watchful heart which lead a man robe prepared for temptation and able to resist it when it arises. Such a one distrusts himself, takes heed lest he fall (1 Corinthians 10:12), and works out his salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12; comp. Proverbs 14:16). \"Grow not thoughtless of retribution\" ('Pirke Aboth,' 1:8). A horror of sin cannot be instilled too early into the young. Septuagint, \"Happy is the man who piously (δἰ εὐλάβειαν) fears all things.\" St. Bernard ('In Cant. Serm.,' 54:9),\" In veritate didici, nil aeque efficax esse ad gratiam promerendam, retinendam, recuperandam, quam si omni tempore coram Deo inveniaris non altum sapere, sed timere. Time ergo cum arriserit gratia, time cum abierit, time cum denuo revertetur; et hoc est semper pavidum esse.\" He that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief; or, calamity (Proverbs 17:20). A man hardens his heart who attends not to the voice of conscience, the restraints of religion, the counsel of friends, the warnings of experience (comp. ver. 26; Proverbs 29:1; Exodus 8:15; Psalm 95:8). This man scorns the grace of God, loses his protection, and must come to misery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A wicked ruler over the poor people; a people weak and resourceless. To such a powerful tyrant is as fatal as a roaring lion or a hungry bear prowling in quest of food. The prophets compare evil rulers to ravenous lions (see Jeremiah 4:7; Ezekiel 19:6). They are like lions in strength and cruelty, like bears in craft and ferocity. Septuagint, \"A hungry lion and a thirsty wolf is he, who, being poor, rules over an indigent nation.\" The poverty of the subjects embitters the conduct of the ruler.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor; literally, and rich in oppression. Ewald, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others take the verse, not as a statement, but as a warning addressed to the ruler, as we have so many addressed to a son, and as the author of the Book of Wisdom calls upon the judges of the earth to listen to his admonitions. They therefore render thus: \"O prince, void of understanding, but rich in oppression!\" The wording and accentuation of the passage confirm this view. Caher renders, \"A prince that wants understanding increases his exactions.\" The want of intelligence makes a prince cruel and tyrannical and callous to suffering: not possessing the wisdom and prudence necessary for right government, he defrauds his subjects, treats them unjustly, and causes great misery. See the prophet's denunciation of Shallum and Jehoiakim for these very crimes (Jeremiah 22:13-19). Septuagint, \"A king wanting revenues is a great oppresser (συκοφάντης).\" He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days (Proverbs 15:27). The prince addressed is thus warned that his oppressive acts will be visited upon him judicially; that only a ruler who deals with his subjects liberally and equitably can attain to old age, and that his conduct will shorten his life. An early death is reckoned as a token of God's indignation. The second hemistich Caher translates, \"But he who hates lucre shall reign long.\" Septuagint, \"He who hateth iniquity shall live a long time.\" (For \"covetousness\" (betsa), see on Proverbs 1:19.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit. This should be, a man oppressed (Isaiah 38:14), burdened, with the blood of anyone. The wilful murderer, with his guilt upon his soul, flies in vain from remorse; his crime pursues him even to the grave. For inadvertent manslaughter the cities of refuge offered an asylum, but for deliberate murder there was no safe refuge, either from the stings of conscience or from the avenger of blood, but death. The homicide, like Cain (Genesis 4:14), must be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. \"Pit\" (bor), some take to mean any hiding place, \"a cave, or well;\" but it is very commonly found in the sense of sepulchre (Psalm 28:1; Isaiah 14:19, etc.), and is so explained here by most commentators. Let no man stay him. We had in Proverbs 24:11, etc., an injunction to save human life; but the case was quite different from this of wilful murder. Here it is directed that no one attempt to save him from the punishment which he has incurred, or to comfort him under the remorse which he suffers. Let him be left alone to meet the fate which he has merited. The LXX. gives a different idea to the gnome, \"He who becomes bail for a man charged with murder shall be banished and shall not be in safety.\" They add a verse which we shall meet again, almost in the same words (Proverbs 29:17, 18), \"Chasten thy son, and he will love thee, and will give honour to thy soul; he shall not obey a sinful nation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved. \"Uprightly\" (tamim); innocently, blamelessly (Psalm 15:2). Vulgate, simpliciter; Septuagint, δικαίως; Aquila, Symmachus, τέλειος. \"He is helped (βεβοήθηται),\" Septuagint. Things shall prosper with him; God will work with him, and save him in dangers temporal and spiritual. But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. \"He that is perverse of two ways,\" or \"in a double way,\" as ver. 6. The man who is not straightforward, but vacillates between right and wrong, or pretends to be pursuing one path while he is really taking another, shall fall suddenly and without warning. בְּאֶחָת means \"all at once,\" or \"once for all,\" and so that nothing else is possible, equivalent to penitus. Schultens quotes Virgil, 'AEneid,' 11:418 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Procubuit moriens et humum semel ore momordit.\" Septuagint, \"He that walketh in crooked ways will be entangled.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - A variation of Proverbs 12:11. Shall have poverty enough. The new clause marks the antithesis more clearly than that above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - A faithful man shall abound with blessings. \"Faithful,\" as in Proverbs 20:6, one on whom one can depend, honest and upright. Septuagint, ἀξιόπιστος. The blessings signified are such as come from God and man. Men will utter his name with praise and benediction (comp. Job 29:8, etc.), and God will show his approval by sending material prosperity. He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent (comp. ver. 22, and note there; Proverbs 13:11; Proverbs 20:21; Proverbs 21:5). One who is only anxious to become quickly rich, and is unscrupulous as to means, cannot be \"a faithful man,\" and therefore cannot be blessed. Instead of \"innocent,\" many expositors render \"unpunished\" (as Proverbs 17:5), which better contrasts with the blessings mentioned in the first hemistich, though the two ideas are coordinate. On this haste of covetousness, Juvenal writes ('Sat.,' 14:173) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Inde fere scelerum causae; nec plura venenaNEWLINEMiscuit aut ferro grassatur saepius ullumNEWLINEHumanae mentis vitium, quam saeva cupidoNEWLINEImmodici census; nam dives qui fieri vult,NEWLINEEt cito vult fieri.

For for a piece of bread that man will transgress. Thus translated, this clause confirms the former, and says that a judge given to favouritism will swerve from right under the smallest temptation. But to bribe a judge with a morsel of bread seems an unlikely idea; and the gnome is of general application, \"And for a morsel of bread a man [not 'that man'] will transgress.\" As some men in responsible positions are often swayed by low and unworthy considerations, so in social life a very insignificant cause is sufficient to warp the judgment of some persons, or draw them aside from the line of rectitude. (For \"a piece of bread,\" as denoting abject poverty or a thing of no value, see on Proverbs 6:26) The commentators cite Aul. Gell., 'Noct. Att.,' 1:15, \"Frusto panis conduci potest vel uti taceat vel uti loquatur.\" Septuagint, \"He that regards not the persons of the just is not good; such a cue will sell a man for a morsel of bread.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He that hasteth to be rich bath an evil eye (see ver. 20); better, the man of evil eye hasteth after riches. The man of evil eye (Proverbs 23:6) is the envious and covetous man; such a one tries to improve his position and raise himself speedily to the height of him whom he envies, and is quite unscrupulous as to the means which he uses to effect his purpose, and keeps all that he gains selfishly to himself. And yet he is really blind to his own best interests (comp Proverbs 20:21). And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him (comp. Proverbs 23:4, 5). His grasping greed brings no blessing with it (Proverbs 11:25), excites others to defraud him, and in the end consigns him to merited poverty. The LXX. here reads somewhat differently, and translates, \"An envious man hasteth to be rich, and knows not that the merciful man (chasid instead of cheser) will I,ave the mastery over him,\" i.e. will take his wealth, as ver. 8. Proverbs concerning hastily gotten wealth have already been given. Here are a few more: Spanish, \"Who would be rich in a year gets hanged in half a year;\" Italian, \"The river does not become swollen with clear water;\" says a Scotch proverb, \"Better a wee fire to warm as than a meikle fire to burn us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour. The word rendered \"afterwards\" (postea, Vulgate), אַחֲרַי (acharai), creates a difficulty. The suffix cannot be that of the first person singular, which would give no sense; hence most interpreters see in it a peculiar adverb attached to the following verb, \"shall afterwards find.\" Delitzsch. Lowenstein, end Nowack take it for a noun with the termination -ai, and translate, \"a man that goeth backward,\" \"a backslider\" (as Jeremiah 7:24). Hence the translation will run, \"He who reproveth a backsliding man,\" i.e. one whom he sees to be turning away from God and duty. He shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue (comp. Proverbs 27:6; Proverbs 29:5). A faithful counsellor, who tells a man his faults, brings them home to his conscience, and checks him in his downward course, will be seen to be a true friend, and will be loved and respected both by the one whom he has warned and advised and by all who are well disposed. James 5:19, \"If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him. let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and stroll hide a multitude of sins.\" \"Laudat adulator, sed non est verus amator.\" The flatterer says only what is agreeable to the man whom he flatters, and thus makes him conceited and selfish and unable to see himself as he really is: the true friend says harsh things, but they are wholesome and tend to spiritual profit, and show more real affection than all the soft words of the fawning parasite. Septuagint, \"He that reproveth a man's ways shall have more thanks than he who flattereth with the tongue.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Whoso robbeth his father or his mother (comp. Proverbs 19:26); taking from them what belongs to them. Septuagint, \"He who casts off (ἀποβάλλεται) father or mother.\" And saith, It is no transgression. He salves his conscience by thinking all would be his ere long in the course of nature; or he uses the plea of Corban denounced by our Lord (Mark 7:11, etc.). The same is the companion of a destroyer (Proverbs 18:9); is no better than, stands in the position of, one who practises openly against his neighbour's life and property. He is a thief, and fails in the simplest duty. Vulgate, particeps homicidae est. There may be an allusion to the guilt incurred by a witness in concealing his knowledge of a crime, which is denounced in Leviticus 5:1 (comp. Judges 17:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife (Proverbs 15:18; Proverbs 29:22); literally, he that is of a wide soul. This may certainly denote pride (qui se jactat et dilatat, Vulgate), in which case the gnome says that one who thinks much of himself and despises others is the cause of quarrels and dissensions, occasioned by his struggles for pre-eminence and the ill feeling arising from his overbearing and supercilious conduct. Others, and rightly, take the wide soul to denote covetousness (comp. Proverbs 23:2; Isaiah 14; Habakkuk 2:5). It is the man of insatiable desire, the grasping avaricious man, who excites quarrels and mars all peace, and in the end destroys himself. \"Whence come wars,\" asks St. James (James 4:1), \"and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members? Ye lust, and have act; ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war.\" Septuagint, \"An unbelieving [ἄπιστος, Alexand. ἄπληστος, insatiate] man judgeth rashly.\" But he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat (Proverbs 11:25; Proverbs 16:20; Proverbs 29:25). The character here opposed to the covetous is that of the patient. God-fearing man, who is contented to do his duty, and leave the result in the Lord's hands. This man shall be made fat, shall be comforted and largely blessed, while he who puts his hope in material things shall fall into calamity. Septuagint, \"He who trusts in the Lord will be in his care (ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ ἔσται).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool (see Genesis 6:5; Genesis 8:21). What is here censured is that presumptuous confidence in one's own thoughts, plans, and imaginations which leads a man to neglect both God's inspirations and the counsel of others (comp. ver. 14; Proverbs 14:16). \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fail\" (1 Corinthians 10:12). Septuagint, \"Whoso trusteth to a bold heart, such a one is a fool.\" Whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. This man looks outside himself for direction; be trusts in the wisdom which is from above; he walks in the fear of the Lord, and is saved from the dangers to which self-confidence exposes the fool. The best commentary on the gnome is Jeremiah 9:23, 24, \"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord,\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack (see Proverbs 11:24, etc.; Proverbs 19:17). God in some way compensates what is spent in almsdeeds by shedding his blessing on the benevolent. \"Der Geiz,\" runs the German maxim, \"sammlet sich arm, die Milde giebt sich reich,\" \"Charity gives itself rich; covetousness hoards itself poor\" (Trench). \"Alms,\" said the rabbis, \"are the salt of riches.\" But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse (Proverbs 11:26). The uncharitable man either turns away his eyes that he may not see the misery around him, or pretends not to notice it, lest his compassion should be claimed. The expression, \"hiding the eyes,\" occurs in Isaiah 1:15, \"When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you.\" The unmerciful man meets with the curses of those whom he has neglected to relieve when he had the power, and such curses are ratified and fulfilled because they are deserved, and Divine retribution attends them (see the opposite view, Ver. 20). \"Turn not away thine eye from the needy,\" says the Son of Sirach, \"and give him none occasion to curse thee; for if be curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him\" (Ecclus 4:4, etc.; comp. Tobit 4:7). So in the 'Didache,' ch. 4, we have, Οὐκ ἀποστραφήσῃ τὸν ἐνδεόμενον, \"Thou shalt not turn thyself from one in need.\" Septuagint, \"lie that turneth away his eye shall be in great distress;\" Vulgate, Qui despicit deprecantem sustinebit penuriam.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - When the wicked rise, men hide themselves (see ver. 12); Septuagint, \"In the places of the ungodly the righteous groan.\" But when they perish, the righteous increase (Proverbs 11:10; Proverbs 29:2, 16). The overthrow of the ungodly adds to the prosperity of the righteous, removes an opposing element, and promotes their advancement in influence and numbers.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck; literally, a man of reproofs - one who has had a long experience of rebukes and warnings. Compare \"a man of sorrows\" (Isaiah 53:3). The hardening of the neck is a metaphor derived from obstinate draught animals who will not submit to the yoke (Deuteronomy 10:16; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 27:8). Christ calls his yoke easy, and bids his followers to bear it bravely (Matthew 11:29. etc.). The reproofs may arise from the Holy Spirit and the conscience, from the teaching of the past, or from the counsel of friends. The LXX. (as some other Jewish interpreters) takes the expression in the text actively, \"A man who reproves (ἐλέγχων) is better than one of stiff neck.\" Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy (Proverbs 6:15; Proverbs 15:10). The incorrigible and self-deluding sinners shall come to a fearful and sudden end, though retribution be delayed (comp. Job 34:20; Psalm 2:9; Jeremiah 19:11). And there is no hope in their end; despising all correction, they can have no possibility of restoration. We may refer, as an illustration, to that terrible passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 6:4, etc.), and to the fate of the Jews unto the present day. Septuagint, \"For when he is burning suddenly, there is no remedy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When the righteous are in authority; rather, as in Proverbs 28:28, when the righteous are increased; Vulgate, in multiplicatione justorum. When sinners are put away, and the righteous are in the majority. Septuagint, \"when the just are commended.\" When good men give the tone to society and conduct all affairs according to their own high standard, the peoople rejoice; there is general happiness; prosperity abounds, and voices ring cheerfully (Proverbs 11:10; Proverbs 28:12). When the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn; they suffer violence and injustice, and have bitter cause for complaint and lamentation. This proverb is not applicable to the age of Solomon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The first hemistich is a variation of Proverbs 10. I (where see note). Keepeth company with; literally, feedeth, as Proverbs 28:7. Harlots (see on Proverbs 6:26). Such vice leads to the wasting of substance (Luke 15:13), and the great sorrow of the parent. Septuagint, \"But he that pastureth (ποιμαίνει) harlots shall waste wealth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Many of the proverbs in this chapter seem to suit the time of Jeroboam II. (see on Proverbs 28:3). The king by judgment establisheth the land. The king, the fountain of justice, by his equitable government brings his country into a healthy and settled condition (1 Kings 15:4; comp. Ver. 14; Proverbs 16:12; Proverbs 25:5). In the security of the throne the land and people participate. He that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. The expression, אִישׁ תְּרוּמות (ish terumoth), \"man of offerings,\" \"man of gifts,\" is ambiguous: it may mean \"the taker of bribes,\" the unrighteous ruler who sells justice (Proverbs 15:27), or it may signify \"the imposer of taxes\" (Ezekiel 45:13, etc.) or forced benevolences. Aquila and Theodotion have ἀνὴρ ἀφαιρεμάτων, \"man of heave offerings,\" and Wordsworth regards him as a man who claims and receives gifts, as if he were a deity on earth. Whichever sense we give to the phrase, the contrast lies between the inflexibly upright ruler and the iniquitous or extortionate prince. The Septuagint gives παράνομος, \"a transgressor;\" Vulgate, vir avarus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A man that flattereth his neighbour; says only what is agreeable, applauds his words and actions indiscriminately, and makes him think too well of himself he is no true friend (see Proverbs 28:23). Spreadeth a net for his feet; his stops (Proverbs 26:28; Job 18:8, etc.). If a man listens to such flattering words, and is influenced by them, he works his own ruin; self-deceived, he knows not his real condition, and accordingly makes grievous disaster of his life. The LXX. gives a different turn to the sentence, \"He that prepareth a net before his friend entangles his own feet therein\" (comp. Proverbs 26:27; Proverbs 28:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare (Proverbs 12:13). The snare is that the sinner is caught and held fast by his sin, and cannot escape, as he knows nothing of repentance, and has no will to cast off evil habits (Proverbs 24:16). (For \"snare,\" comp. Proverbs 18:7; Proverbs 20:25; Proverbs 22:25.) Septuagint, \"For a man sinning there lies a great snare.\" But the righteous doth sing and rejoice. The antithesis is not very obvious. It may mean that the good man has a conscience at peace, is free from the snare of sin, and therefore is glad; or that, in spite of a momentary fall, though he has transgressed, he knows that God forgives him on his repentance, and this makes him happy; or, generally that he rejoices in the happy life which his virtue procures for him here and hereafter (Matthew 5:12). In the original \"sing\" represents the sudden outburst of joy, \"rejoice\" the continued state of happiness. \"The righteous shall be in joy and gladness (ἐν χαρᾷ καὶ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ),\" Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Considereth the cause; recognizes the claims, and, as the word din implies, supports them at the seat of judgment (comp. Job 29:12, 16; Psalm 82:3, etc.). Septuagint, \"A righteous man knows how to judge for the poor.\" The wicked regardeth not to know it. This is a clumsy translation; it means, pays no attention so as to become fully acquainted with its details and bearings. But the words signify rather, as in the Revised Version margin, \"understandeth not knowledge\" (Proverbs 19:25; Proverbs 28:5), has no knowledge which would lead him to enter into the poor man's case, and to sympathize with him in his distress; the claims of the feeble to recognition and relief at his hands are utterly unknown and disregarded. He can daily look on Lazarus at his gate, and find no call for his pity and charity; he can see the wounded traveller in the road, and pass by on the other side. The LXX. offers two translations of the latter clause, reading the second time דשׁ instead of רשׁע, and thereby not improving the sense: \"But the ungodly understand. eth not knowledge, and the poor man hath not an understanding mind.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTScornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Scornful men bring a airy into a snare. \"Men of derision\" (Isaiah 28:14) are those who despise and scoff at all things great and high, whether sacred or profane (see on Proverbs 1:22). These are the persons who raise rebellion in a country and excite opposition to constituted authority. The rendering of יָפִיתיּ, \"bring into a snare,\" as in the Authorized Version, is supported by some of the Jewish versions and commentaries; but the more correct rendering is \"blow into a blaze, inflame,\" as the Revised Version (comp. Job 20:26; Ezekiel 22:20, 21). These scorners excite the populace to acts of fury, when all respect for piety and virtue is lost; they fan the passions of the fickle people, and lead them to civil discord and dangerous excesses (comp. Proverbs 22:10). Septuagint, \"Lawless men burn up a city.\" But wise men turn away wrath; by their prudent counsels allay the angry passions roused by those evil men (see Ver. 11 and Proverbs 15:1, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man - if a wise man has a controversy, either legal or social, with a wicked fool - whether he rage (is angry) or laugh, there is no rest. It is a question whether the wise man or the fool is the subject of this clause. St. Jerome makes the former the subject, Vir sapiens, si cum stulto contenderit, sive irascatur, sive rideat, non inveniet requiem. It matters not how the wise man treats the fool; he may be stern and angry, he may be gentle and good tempered, yet the fool will be none the better, will not be reformed, will not cease from his folly, will carry on his cavilling contention. Hitzig, Delitzsch, and others, deeming that the rage and the laughter are not becoming to the character of the wise man, take the fool as the subject; so that the sense is, that after all has been said, the fool only falls into a passion or laughs at the matter, argument is wasted upon him, and the controversy is never settled. This seems to be the best interpretation, and is somewhat supported by the Septuagint, \"A wise man shall judge the nations, but a worthless man, being angry, laughs and fears not [καταγελᾶται καὶ οὐ καταπτήσσει, which may also mean, 'is derided and terrifies no one'].\" Wordsworth notes that the irreligious fool is won neither by the austere preaching of John the Baptist nor by the mild teaching of Christ, but rejects both (Matthew 11:16-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The bloodthirsty hate the upright; him that is perfect, Revised Version; ὅσιον, Septuagint. His life is a tacit reproach to men of blood, robbers, murderers, and such like sinners, as is finely expressed in the Book of Wisdom 2:12, etc. (comp. 2 Corinthians 6:14). But the just seek his soul. The explanation of this hemistich is doubtful. The following interpretations have been offered:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The just seek the soul of the upright to deliver him from death temporal and spiritual (comp. Proverbs 12:6; Psalm 142:4).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The just seek the murderer's life, take vengeance on him (comp. Psalm 63:9, 10).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"As for the just, they (the murderers) attempt his life,\" where the change of subject, though by no means unparalleled, is awkward (comp. Psalm 37:14). The second explanation makes the righteous the executioners of vengeance on the delinquents, which does not seem to be the idea intended, and there is no confirmation of it in our book. The interpretation first given has against it the fact that the phrase, \"to seek the soul,\" is used of attempts against the life, not of preserving it. But this is not fatal; and the above seems to be the most likely explanation offered, and gives a good antithesis. Men of blood hate a virtuous man, and try to destroy him; the righteous love him, and do their utmost to defend and keep him safe. If this interpretation is rejected, the third explanation is allowable, the casus pendens - \"the just, they seek his life\" - may be compared with Genesis 26:15; Deuteronomy 2:23. Septuagint, \"But the upright will seek (ἐκζητήσουσι) his life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A fool uttereth all his mind; his spirit; רוּחו, i.e. \"his anger;\" θυμόν, Septuagint (comp. Proverbs 16:32). The wording of the second hemistich confirms this rendering. A fool pours out his wrath, restrained by no consideration. It is a wise maxim that says, \"Command your temper, lest it command you;\" and again, \"When passion enters in at the foregate, wisdom goes out at the postern.\" So we have the word attributed to Evenus Parius -NEWLINENEWLINEΠολλάκις ἀνθρώπων ὀργὴ νόον ἐξεκάλυψεNEWLINEΚρυπτόμενον μανίας πουλὺ χερειότερον.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Wrath often hath revealed man's hidden mind,NEWLINEThan madness more pernicious.\" A wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. This clause is capable of more than one explanation. The Authorized Version says that the wise man restrains his own anger till he can give it proper vent. The term בְּאָחור occurs nowhere else, and is rendered \"at last,\" \"finally,\" and by Delitzsch, \"within,\" i.e. in his heart. The verb rendered \"keepeth in\" (shabach) is rather \"to calm,\" \"to hush,\" as in Psalm 65:7; Psalm 89:10, \"Which stilleth the noise of the seas.\" So we have the meaning: The wise man calms the auger within him; according to the proverb, Irae dilatio, mentis pacatio. Or the anger calmed may be that of the fool: The wise man appeases it after it has been exhibited; he knows how to apply soothing remedies to the angry man, and in the end renders him calm and amenable to reason.

The deceitful man. This makes no contrast with the poor. \"The man of oppressions\" (tekakim) is the usurer, from whom the poor suffer most wrong and cruelty. The needy man and the rich lender are thrown together in social life. St. Jerome calls them pauper et creditor. Septuagint, \"When the creditor and debtor meet together, the Lord maketh inspection (ἐπσκοπὴν) of both.\" The Lord lighteneth both their eyes. Both rich and poor, the oppressor and the oppressed, owe their light and life to God; he makes the sun to rise on the evil and on the good; he sends rain on the just and the unjust; he is the Father, Ruler, and Judge of all. Here is comfort for the poor, that he has a tender Father who watches over him; here is a warning for the rich, that he will have to give an account of his stewardship. The former proverb spoke only generally of God being the Maker of both (comp. Psalm 13:8; Ecclesiastes 11:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The king that faithfully judgeth the poor (comp.

Inflexible fidelity to duty is intended - that perfect impartiality, which dispenses justice alike to rich and poor, uninfluenced By personal or social considerations. His throne shall be established forever. Being founded on righteousness, it shall pass on to his descendants for many generations (comp. Jeremiah 22:3, etc.). The LXX., pointing differently, have, \"His throne shall be established for a testimony\" (lahed, instead of lahad).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The rod and reproof give wisdom to the young. The former denotes bodily correction, what we call corporal punishment; the latter, discipline in words, rebuke administered when any moral fault is noticed. The idea here enunciated is very common in this book (see Proverbs 10:1, 13; Proverbs 13:24; Proverbs 23:13). But a child loft to himself bringeth his mother to shame. The verb translated \"left\" (שָׁלַח, shalach) is used in Job 39:5 of the wild ass left to wander free where it wills. A child allowed to do as he likes, undisciplined - spoiled, as we call it - is a shame to his mother, whose weakness has led to this want of restraint, fond love degenerating into over-indulgence (comp. Proverbs 17:21; Proverbs 28:7).

The verb rabah is used in both parts of the sentence, and should have been so translated, When the wicked increase, transgression increaseth. Septuagint, \"When the godless are many, sins become many.\" Where the wicked get the upper hand in a community, their evil example is copied, and a lowering of moral tone and a general laxity in conduct prevail (see on ver. 12: comp. also ver. 2; Proverbs 28:12, 28). But the righteous shall see their fall. Retribution shall overtake them, and God's justice shall be vindicated. This the righteous shall witness, and shall rejoice in the vengeance, when his eye shall see its desire upon his enemies (Psalm 54:7; see also Psalm 37:34; Psalm 73:17, etc.). Septuagint (punctuating differently), \"But when they (the godless) fall, the righteous become fearful (κατάφοβοι);\" they are awestruck at the sudden and grievous fall of sinners.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCorrect thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest (Proverbs 19:18); Septuagint, ἀναπαύσει σε. He will be no longer a source of care and disquiet to you. Delight (maadanim); properly, dainty dishes, and then any great and special pleasure (comp. Ecclus. 30:1-12). Septuagint, \"He shall give ornament (κόσμον) to thy soul.\" This verse and the following are presented by the Greek version in a mutilated form after Proverbs 28:17 (where see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Where there is no vision, the people perish; rather, cast off restraint, become ungovernable, cannot be reined in (Exodus 32:22, 25). \"Vision\" (chazon), prophecy in its widest sense, denotes the revelation of God's will made through agents, which directed the course of events, and was intended to be coordinate with the supreme secular authority. The prophets were the instructors of the people in Divine things, standing witnesses of the truth and power of religion, teaching a higher than mere human morality. The fatal effect of the absence of such revelation of God's will is stated to be confusion, disorder, and rebellion; the people, uncontrolled, fall into grievous excesses, which nothing but high principles can restrain. We note the licence of Eli's time, when there was no open vision (1 Samuel 3.); in Asa's days, when Israel had long been without a teaching priest (2 Chronicles 15:3); and when the impious Ahaz \"made Judah naked\" (2 Chronicles 28:19); or when the people were destroyed by reason of lack of knowledge of Divine things (Hosea 4:6). Thus the importance of prophecy in regulating the life and religion of the people is fully acknowledged by the writer, in whose time, doubtless, the prophetical office was in full exercise: but this seems to be the only passage in the book where such teaching is directly mentioned; the instructors and preceptors elsewhere introduced as disseminating the principles of the chochmah being parents, or tutors, or professors, not inspired prophets. But he that keepeth the Law, happy is he! \"The Law\" (torah) is not merely the written Mosaic Law, but the announcement of God's will by the mouth of his representatives; and the thought is, not the blessedness of those who in a time of anarchy and irreligion keep to the authorized enactments of the Sinaitic legislation, but a contrast between the lawlessness and ruin of a people uninfluenced by religious guidance, and the happy state of those who obey alike the voice of God, whether conveyed in written statutes or by the teaching of living prophets. (For \"happy is he,\" comp. Proverbs 14:21; Proverbs 16:20.) Septuagint, \"There shall be no interpreter (ἐξηγητὴς) to a sinful nation, but he that keepeth the Law is most blessed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - A servant will not be corrected by words. Mere words will not suffice to teach a slave, any more than a child, true, practical wisdom. He needs severer measures, even the correction of personal discipline. Septuagint, \"By words a stubborn (σκληρὸς) slave will not be instructed.\" The next clause gives an explanation of this necessity. For though he understand he will not answer. The answer is not merely the verbal response to a command, as, \"I go, sir;\" but it implies obedience in action. The reluctant slave thoroughly understands the order given, but he pays no heed to it, will not trouble himself to execute it, and therefore must meet with stern treatment (comp. ver. 15; Proverbs 23:13, etc.; Proverbs 26:3). \"That servant which knew his Lord's will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes\" (Luke 12:47). Septuagint, \"For even if he understand, he will not obey.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? (comp. Proverbs 26:12); Vulgate, velocem ad loquendum; Septuagint, ταχὺν ἐν λόγοις. James 1:19,\" Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak.\" \"A talkative (γλωσσώδης) man is dangerous in his city; and he that is rash (προπετὴς) in his words shall be hated\" (Ecclus. 9:18). We might also translate, \"hasty in his matters,\" \"hasty in business,\" and the gnome would be equally true (see note on Proverbs 19:2). There is more hope era fool than of him. The dull, stupid man (kesil) may be instructed and guided and made to listen to reason; the hasty and ill-advised speaker consults no one, takes no thought before he speaks, nor reflects on the effect of his words; such a man it is almost impossible to reform (see James 3:5, etc.). \"Every one that speaks,\" says St. Gregory, \"while he waits for his hearer's sentence upon his words, is as it were subjected to the judgment of him by whom he is heard. Accordingly, he that fears to be condemned in respect of his words ought first to put to the test that which he delivers - that there may be a kind of impartial and sober umpire sitting between the hear and tongue, weighing with exactness whether the heart presents right words, which the tongue taking up with advantage may bring forward for the heater's judgment\" ('Moral.,' 8:5, Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child. The verb panak, which is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, is rightly here translated as in the Vulgate, qui delicate nutrit. It refers to the spoiling a person by over-refinement, luxury, and pampering - a treatment peculiarly unsuitable in the case of a bond servant, and one which makes such forgetful of his dependent position. Septuagint, \"He that liveth wantonly (κατασπαταλᾷ) from childhood shall be a servant.\" Shall have him become his son at the length; i.e. at length, like \"at the last,\" equivalent to \"at last\" (Proverbs 5:11). The word rendered \"son\" (מַנון, manon) is of doubtful meaning, and has been variously understood or misunderstood by interpreters. Septuagint, \"And in the end shall have pain (ὀδυνηθήσεται) over himself;\" Symmachus, \"shall have murmuring (ἔστα γογγυσμός);\" Vulgate, Postea sentiet eum contumacem. Ewald translates \"ungrateful;\" Delitzsch, \"place of increase,\" i.e. a household of pampered scapegraces; but one does not see how the disaster can be called a place or a house. It seems safest in this uncertainty to adopt the Jewish interpretation of \"progeny:\" \"he will be as a son.\" The pampered servant will end by claiming the privileges of a son, and perhaps ousting the legitimate children from their inheritance (comp. Proverbs 17:2; and the case of Ziba and Mephibosheth, 2 Samuel 16:4). \"Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work for a servant. If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest; but if thou let him go idle, he will seek liberty\" (Ecclus. 33:24, etc.). Spiritual writers have applied this proverb to the pampering of the flesh, which ought to be under the control of its master, the spirit, but which, if gratified and unrestrained, gets the upper hand, and, like a spoiled servant, dictates to its lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - An angry man stirreth up strife. This is a variation of Proverbs 15:18 and Proverbs 28:25 (which see). A furious man aboundeth in transgression. \"A furious man\" is a passionate person, who gives way to violent fits of anger (Proverbs 22:24). Such a man both makes enemies by his conduct and falls into manifold excesses of word and action while under the influence of his wrath. \"The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God\" (James 1:20). The Greek gnome says -NEWLINENEWLINEὈργὴ δὲ πολλὰ δρᾶ῀ιν ἀναγκάζει κακά And again -NEWLINENEWLINEΠόλλ ἔστιν ὀργῆς ἐξ ἀπαιδεύτου κακάNEWLINENEWLINE\"Unchastened anger leads to many ills.\" Septuagint, \"A passionate man diggeth up sin\" - a forcible expression, which is not unusual in reference to quarrels.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A man's pride shall bring him low. The same thought is found in Proverbs 15:33; Proverbs 16:18; Proverbs 25:6, etc.; Luke 14:11. Honour shall uphold the humble in spirit; better, as the Revised Version, he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honour (comp. Proverbs 11:16; Isaiah 57:15). The humble man does not seek honour, but by his life and action unconsciously attains it (comp. Job 22:29). Septuagint, \"Haughtiness brings a man low, but the lowly-minded the Lord upholdeth with glory.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul. The accomplice of a thief puts his own safety in danger. This is explained by what follows: He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not; better, he heareth the adjuration, and telleth not. This refers to the course of proceeding defined by Leviticus 5:1, and intimated in Judges 17:2. When a theft was committed, the person wronged or the judge pronounced an imprecation on the thief and on any one who was privy to the crime, and refrained from giving information; a witness who saw and knew of it, and was silent under this formal adjuration, has to bear his iniquity; he is not only an accomplice of a criminal, he is also a perjurer; one sin leads to another. Some commentators explain the first hemistich as referring only to the crime of receiving or using stolen goods, by which a man commits a crime and exposes himself to punishment; but it is best taken, as above, in connection with the second clause, and as elucidated thereby.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The fear of man bringeth a snare. He who, through fear of what man may do to him, think or say of him, does what he knows to be wrong, lets his moral cowardice lead him into sin, leaves duty undone, - such a man gets no real good from his weakness, outrages conscience, displeases God. See our Lord's words (Matthew 10:28; Mark 8:38; and comp. Isaiah 51:12, etc). Whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe (Proverbs 18:10). Such trust carries a man safe through all dangers; fearing to offend God, living as always under his eye, he feels Divine protection, and knows that whatever happens is for the best. The LXX. joins this to the preceding verse, thus: \"He who shareth with a thief hateth his own soul; and if, when an oath is offered, they who hear it give, no information, they fearing and reverencing men, are overthrown, but he that trusteth in the Lord shall rejoice.\" They add another rendering of the last verse, \"Ungodliness causeth a man to stumble, but he who trusts in the Lord (ἐπὶ τῷ δεσπότῃ 2 Peter 2:1) shall be saved.\" Δεσπότης is used for Jehovah in the New Testament, e.g., Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Many seek the ruler's favour; literally, the countenance of the ruler. A variation of Proverbs 19:6. There are numbers who are always trying, by means fair or surreptitious, to curry favour with a great man who has anything to bestow (comp. 1 Kings 10:24; Psalm 45:12). But every man's judgment cometh from the Lord. The real and only reliable judgment comes, not from an earthly prince (who may be prejudiced and is certainly fallible), but from the Lord, whose approval or disapproval is final and indisputable. Therefore one should seek to please him rather than any man, however great and powerful (comp. 1 Samuel 16:7; Isaiah 49:4; 1 Corinthians 4:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs29:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - An unjust man is an abomination to the just. This great moral contrast, marked and universal, is a fitting close of the book. The word \"abomination\" (toebah) occurs more than twenty times in the Proverbs; it is appropriate here because the good man looks upon the sinner as the enemy of God, as the psalmist says, \"Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them thine enemies\" (Psalm 139:21, etc.). He that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked; because he is a standing reproach to him, and by every tone and look and action seems to express his condemnation (see on Proverbs 21:15, and the Septuagint Version there; and comp. 1 Kings 21:20: Isaiah 53:3; Matthew 8:34; John 15:19). Septuagint, \"A direct way is an abomination to the lawless.\" The Vulgate ends the chapter with a paragraph which is found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint after Proverbs 24:22 (where see note), Verbum custodiens filius extra perditionem erit.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-22. - 3. Third admonitory discourse, pointing out the benefits which arise from a sincere, earnest, and persevering search after Wisdom. This discourse divides itself into three parts.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Vers. 1-9: a statement of the conditions which, if fulfilled, result in the highest knowledge of Jehovah - the fear of Jehovah and the knowledge of God, who is the Source of wisdom and the Protection and Ensurer of safety to the righteous.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Vers. 10-19: the negatively beneficial results of Wisdom, in delivery from the paths of evil, from destructive lusts and passions, from the temptations of wicked men and wicked women.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Vers. 20-22: the epilogue, or conclusion, combining encouragement on the one hand, and warning on the other. Verse 1. - The teacher here reverts to the original form of his address, as appears from the employment of the term, my son. It seems clear that it is no longer Wisdom personified who is the speaker, from the fact that the words, \"wisdom and understanding\" in ver. 2 are used without the possessive pronoun \"my,\" which would have been undoubtedly inserted if this address had been a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter. Some of the ideas of that address, however, are restated, as the crying and lifting up the voice after Wisdom, and the conclusion, wherein the respective destinies of the pious and wicked are portrayed. The particle \"if\" (אֵם) is conditional, and serves to introduce the series of clauses (vers. 1-4) which lay down the conditions upon which the promises depend, and which form the protasis to the double apodosis in vers. 5 and 9. De Wette, Meyer, and Delitzsch regard it as voluntative, as expressing a wish on the part of the teacher, and translate, \"Oh that thou wouldst!\" and אִם, \"if,\" is used in this way in Psalm 139:19; but the LXX. (ἐάν) and Vulgate (si) make it conditional. It is repeated in an emphatic form in ver. 3. Receive. The verbs \"receive\" and \"hide\" show that the endeavour after Wisdom is to be candid and sincere. \"To receive\" (לָקַה) seems to be here used, like the LXX. δεχέσθαι in the sense of \"to receive graciously,\" \"to admit the words of Wisdom.\" It is noticeable that there is a gradation in emphasis in the various terms here used by the teacher. Just as \"commandments\" is stronger than \"words,\" so \"hide\" is stronger than \"receive.\" The emphasizing is carried on in the following verses in the same way, and at length culminates in ver. 4, which sums up the ardent spirit in which the search after Wisdom is to be prosecuted in presenting it to us in its strongest form. Hide. The original (צַפַן, tsaphan) is here used in a different sense to that in which it occurs in Proverbs 1:11 and 18. It here refers, as in Proverbs 7:1; Proverbs 10:14; and Proverbs 13:22, to the storing or laying up, as of treasure, in some secret repository, and means \"to lay up.\" The Divine commands of the teacher are to be hidden in safe custody in the memory, in the understanding, in the conscience, and in the heart (cf. Proverbs 4:21; Proverbs 7:1). The psalmist expresses the same idea in Psalm 119:11, \"Thy words have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This verse is dependent on the preceding. So that thou incline. The literal translation is \"to incline;\" but the inclination of the ear and the application of the heart follow as a consequence upon the precepting ideas (cf. the Vulgate, ut audiat sapientiam auris tua). The root idea of the original (קָשַׁב kashav) is \"to sharpen,\" viz. the ear as expressed, and so to give diligent attention to the precepts of Wisdom. In Proverbs 1:24 it is rendered \"to regard.\" To apply thine heart is to turn the heart with the whole scope of its powers, in the spirit of humility and eagerness, to understanding. As the ear represents the outward vehicle of communication, so the heart (לִב, lev) represents the inward, the intellectual faculty, the mind, or it may mean the affections as suggested by the LXX. καρδία and Vulgate cor. Understanding (תְּבוּנָה, t'vunah) is here interchanged with \"wisdom,\" which must determine its meaning to some extent. The LXX. interpreters take it as σύνεσις, the faculty of comprehension.\" Like בִינָה (vinah) in Proverbs 1:2, the word describes the faculty of distinguishing or separating: but it does not appear to be here used as representing this \"as a faculty of the soul, but as a Divine power which communicates itself as the gift of God\" (Delitzsch). A second and perhaps simpler sense may be given to the sentence. It may mean the turning or applying of the heart in an affectionate and loving way, i.e. with full purpose, to the discrimination of what is right and what wrong. The ideas of wisdom and understanding seem to some extent to be brought forward as personifications. They are things outside of ourselves, to which we have to give attention. Religion appeals not only to the affections, but also to the intellect, as this satisfies all the yearnings of our nature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Yea, if thou criest after knowledge. The endeavour after Wisdom is not only to be sincere, it is also to be earnest, as appears from the \"yea, if,\" and the verbs \"crying\" and \"lifting up the voice,\" both of which frequently occur in Scripture as indicating earnestness. This earnestness is the counterpart of that which Wisdom herself displays (see Proverbs 1:20, 21). Knowledge; i.e. insight. In the original there is practically little difference between \"knowledge\" and \"understanding\" (בִּינָה and תְּבוּנָה). They carry on the idea expressed in \"understanding\" in the preceding verse, and thus throw the emphasis on the verbs. The LXX. and Vulgate, however, take \"knowledge\" as equivalent to σοφία, sapientia, \"wisdom.\" The reading of the Targum, \"If thou tallest understanding thy mother,\" arises from reading אִם for אֵם, but is not to be preferred to the Masoretic text, as it destroys the parallelism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If thou seekest, etc. The climax in the series of conditions is reached in this verse; and the imagery employed in both clauses indicates that the search after Wisdom is to be persevering, unrelaxing, and diligent, like the unremitting toil and labour with which men carry on mining operations. \"To seek\" (בָּקַשׁ, bakash) in the original is properly \"to seek diligently\" (piel), and is kindred to \"to search\" (קָפַשׂ, khaphas), which again is equivalent to \"to dig\" (חָפַר, khaphar), the Vulgate effodere, \"to dig out.\" Compare the expression in Job 3:21, \"And dig for it more than for hid treasures.\" We trace in these verbs the idea in the mind of the teacher indicated above, which finds expression also in the object of the search, the silver, in its crude state, and the hidden treasures (מַטְמֹנִים mat'monim), i.e. the treasures of gold, silver, and precious metal concealed in the earth. The comparison here made between the search for Wisdom and the search for the hidden treasures of the earth was not unfamiliar to the Hebrew mind, as it is found worked out with great beauty of detail in the twenty-eighth chapter of Job. Again, the comparison of Wisdom with things most precious in the estimation of man is natural and common, and occurs in Psalm 119:72; Job 28:15-19. The same ideas and comparisons here used are presented to us in the New Testament teaching, in our Lord's parable of the man who finds the hid treasure in the field, and, in the phraseology of St. Paul, who speaks of \"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,\" and of \"the unsearchable riches of Christ.\" \"Divine knowledge is an inexhaustible mine of precious ore\" (Wardlaw). The language of the Proverbs would receive additional three from the circumstances of the reign of Solomon, the most splendid and prosperous era in the annals of the Jewish national history, in the means taken to secure the treasures of other and distant countries; the wealth and the riches of that reign (see 2 Chronicles 9:20-22) would help to bring out the idea of the superlative value of Wisdom. In no era of the Jewish national history was there such abundance of riches, such splendid prosperity, as in the reign of Solomon, whose ships of Tarshish brought \"gold and silver\" (see 2 Chronicles 9:20-22), and this state of things would give point to the comparisons which the teacher uses in our text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord. Then (אָן), introducing the first apodosis, and answering to the conditional \"if\" of vers. 1, 3, 4. The earnest endeavour after Wisdom meets with its reward, and those that seek shall find (cf. Matthew 7:7): and thus an inducement is held forth to listen to the admonition of the teacher. Understand implies the power of discernment, but Zockler gives it the further moaning of taking to one's self as a spiritual possession, just as \"find\" meaning primarily \"to arrive at\" conveys the idea of getting possession of (Mercerus). The fear of the Lord (יְרְאַת יְחוָה, yir'ath y'hovah); \"the fear of Jehovah,\" as in Proverbs 1:7. As it is the beginning, so it is the highest form of knowledge and the greatest good. Elsewhere it is represented as a fountain of life (Proverbs 15:27). All true wisdom is summed up in \"the fear of the Lord.\" It here means the reverence due to him, and so comprises the whole range of the religious affections and feelings, which respond to various attributes of the Divine character as they are revealed, and which find their expression in holy worship. The knowledge of God (דַעַת ךאלֹהִים, daath Elohim); literally, the knowledge of Elohim. Not merely cognition, but knowledge in its wider sense. The two ideas of \"the fear of the Lord\" and \"the knowledge of God\" act reciprocally on each other. Just as without reverence of God there can be no knowledge of him in its true sense, so the knowledge of God will increase and deepen the feeling of reverence. But it is noticeable that the teacher here, as in Proverbs 9:10, where, however, it is \"the knowledge of the holy\" (דַעַת קְדשִׁים, daath k'doshim), gives the chief place to reverence, and thus indicates that it is the basis of knowledge, which is its fruit and result. The relation here suggested is analogous to that which subsists between faith and knowledge, and recalls the celebrated dictum of Anselm: \"Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam; sed credo, ut intelligam.\" Elohim, here interchanged with Jehovah, is not of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, as it is only found therein five times, while the predominating word which is used to designate the Deity is Jehovah. But it is difficult to draw any distinction between them here. Jehovah may refer more especially to the Personality of the Divine nature, while Elohim may refer to Christ's glory (Plumptre). Bishop Wordsworth thinks that a distinction is made between the knowledge of Elohim and the knowledge of man which is of little worth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For the Lord giveth wisdom. The Lord Jehovah is the only and true Source of wisdom. The truth stated here is also met with in Daniel 2:21, \"He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.\" He \"giveth,\" or more properly, \"will give\" (יִתֵּן yitten, future of נָתַן, nathan), wisdom; but the connection requires us to understand that the assurance applies only to those who seek after it earnestly and truly (cf. James 1:5-7). The two coefficients to our obtaining wisdom are our efforts and God's assistance. Solomon may be adduced as s striking exemplification of this; he asked for \"an understanding heart,\" and God graciously granted his request (see 1 Kings 3:9, 12). Out of his mouth (מִפִיו, mippiv); ex ore ejus; God is here spoken of anthropologically. He is the true Teacher. The meaning is that God communicates wisdom through the medium of his Word (Delitzsch. Pi.). The law proceeds from his mouth (Job 22:22). In the Book of Wisdom (7:25), \"Wisdom is the breath of the power of God.\" His word is conveyed to us through men divinely inspired, and hence St. Peter (2 Peter 1:21) says that \"holy men of old spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Wisdom which is the foundation of security and safety, and hence is sound wisdom, is that which God treasures up for the righteous. The teacher passes to another phase of the Divine character. God is not only the Source of wisdom; he is also the Ensurer of safety, the Source of salvation to those who act uprightly. It will be noted that the use of the word is confined to the Proverbs and Job, with the exception of the two passages in Isaiah and Micah. Buckler. Besides storing up the treasures of sound wisdom, which the righteous may use and so obtain security in their uprightness, God is himself a Buckler, or Shield (מָגֵן, magen), to those who walk in innocence. This aspect of God's directly protecting power is met with in other parts of Scripture. In Genesis 15:1 he encourages Abram with the assurance, \"I am thy Shield.\" In Psalm 33:20; Psalm 84:11; Psalm 89:18; Psalm 144:2, Jehovah is called a Shield to his saints. He renders them security against the assaults of their enemies, and especially against the fiery darts of the wicked one. Again, in Proverbs 30:5, it is said, \"God is a Shield (magen) up to them that walk uprightly.\" It is incorrect to take מָגֵן (magen) either as an accusative after the verb or in apposition with \"sound wisdom.\" To them that walk uprightly; literally, to the walkers in innocence (לְחֹלֵכֵי תֹם, l'khol'key thom). תֹם (thom) is \"integrity of mind,\" \"moral faultlessness,\" \"innocence.\" \"To walk uprightly\" is to maintain a course of life regulated by right principles, and directed to right ends. He \"walks uprightly who lives with the fear of God as his principle, the Word of God as his rule, and the glory of God as his end\" (Wardlaw). The completeness of the moral and religious character is involved in the expression which is found also in Proverbs 10:9 and Psalm 84:11. The Vulgate translates the latter clause of the verse, proteget gradientes simpliciter, \"he will protect those who walk in simplicity;\" cf. 2 Corinthians 1:12 in illustration of the phrase. He layeth up; i.e. he treasures up (LXX., θησαυρίζειν), or preserves and protects (custodire, Vulgate), as a person does \"treasure or jewel, that it may not be stolen\" (Zockler). The majority of commentators read the Keri (יִצפֹן, \"he will treasure up,\" future of צָפַן) in preference to the Khetib (צָפַן, perfect of same verb, with prefix וְ, \"and he treasured up\"), and this is the; reading adopted in the Authorized Version. The Keri implies that God does treasure up sound wisdom, while the Khetib, as Delitzsch observes, has the force of the aorist, and so represents the treasuring up as an accomplished fact. The same verb occurs in Proverbs 2:1, where it is translated in the Authorized Version by \"hide,\" and also in Proverbs 7:1 and Proverbs 10:14 by \"lay up.\" The laying up, or treasuring, points to the preciousness of that which is treasured, \"sound wisdom.\" Sound wisdom. A great variety of opinions exists as to the true meaning of the word in the original, תְוּשִׁיָה (tvushiyyah), of which \"sound wisdom\" is an interpretation. Zockler explains it as \"wisdom, reflection;\" Delitzsch, as \"advancement and promotion;\" Dathe, as \"solid fortune;\" Gesenius, as \"aid.\" The proper meaning of the word seems to he \"substance,\" from the root יָשָׁה, \"to be, to exist, to be firm.\" Professor Lee remarks on the word, \"From the places in which it occurs, either wealth, thought, or some such sense it manifestly requires. It occurs in Job 6:13, in parallelism with 'help;' in Proverbs 2:7, with a 'shield;' in Job 1:6, with 'wisdom;' in Job 12:16, with 'strength;' in Proverbs 3:21, with 'discretion;' in Proverbs 8:14, with 'counsel' and 'understanding;' in Isaiah 28:29, with 'counsel;' and so in Job 26:3. In Job 30:22 and Micah 6:9, 'entirely' or the like seems to suit the context; see also Proverbs 18:1, and generally 'excess,' or 'abundance,' taken either in a good or bad sense, and varied by other considerations, seems to prevail in every case in which this word is used\" (see Professor Lee, on Job 5:12). The parallelism of the passage before us seems to require that it should be understood in the sense of security; and transferring the idea to wisdom as the means of security. This idea is reproduced in the LXX. σωτήρια, the Vulgate salus, and the Targum incolumitas.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He keepeth the paths of judgment. This verse is explanatory of the latter hemistich of ver. 7, and points out more fully in what way God is a Protector of his saints. Some connect the Hebrew infinitive לִנְצור (lin'tsor), \"to watch or keep,\" with \"them that walk uprightly,\" and translate, \"them that walk uprightly by keeping the paths of judgment;\" but this is to transfer the idea of protection from God to such persons. The verb signifies specially \"to defend, to preserve from danger,\" as in Proverbs 22:12, \"The eyes of the Lind preserve knowledge; i.e. defend or protect it from danger.\" It is God who \"keepeth the paths of judgment,\" as he alone has the power to do so. He watches over all that walk therein, guides, superin. tends, and protects them. The paths of judgment; or rather, justice, ךארְהות מִשְׁפָט (at'khoth mishpat). The abstract is here used for the concrete, and the phrase means \"the paths of the just,\" i.e. the paths in which the just walk, or \"those who walk justly\" (Mercerus). This expression corresponds with \"the way of his saints,\" just as \"keep\" and \"preserve\" are synonymous verbs, both meaning \"to guard, keep safe, or protect.\" He preserveth the way of his saints. God does thisNEWLINENEWLINE(1) by his preventing grace, as in Psalm 66:9, \"He suffereth not our feet to slip.\" Cf. Hannah's song, \"He will keep the feet of his saints\" (1 Samuel 2:9);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by angelic agency, as in Psalm 91:11, \"He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.\" The saints are ever under the watchful care and mighty protection of Jehovah. His saints (חֲסִידָו khasidav); i.e. the pious towards God, the godly, those in whose hearts the principles of sanctity have been implanted, and who cherish earnest inward love to God, and \"walk righteously\" and \"speak uprightly\" (Isaiah 33:15). It is remarkable that the word saints only occurs once (in this passage) in the Proverbs. During the period of the Maccabaean Wars, a party or sect, which aimed at ceremonial purity, claimed for themselves the title of Chasidim or Asidaeans (Ἀσιδαῖοι), as expressive of their piety or devotion. They are those whom Moses called \"men of holiness,\" Exodus 22:31 (ואֲנְשֵׁיאּקֹדֶשׁ, v'an'shev-kodesh); cf. Psalm 89:5; Psalm 149:1; Psalm 89:8; Deuteronomy 33:3; Daniel 7:18, 22, 22, 25. Under the Christian dispensation, the saints are those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus (1 Corinthians 1:2; 1 John 5:1), and who are holy in all manner of conversation (1 Peter 1:25; 1 Macc. 2:42 1 Macc. 7:13; 2 Macc. 14:6); see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians and Philemon,' diss. 2, p. 355.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then (אָז, az), repeated from ver. 5, introduces the second apodosis. As the former referred to God, so this appears to refer more especially to man, and thus we have stated the whole benefit, in its twofold aspect, which Wisdom confers on those who diligently seek her. It is not to be affirmed, however, that righteousness and judgment and equity refer exclusively to man; they must represent some aspects of our relationship to God, both from the meaning of the words themselves, and because the law which regulates our dealings and intercourse with man has its seat in the higher law of our relation to God. Righteousness, and judgment, and equity. These three words occur in the same collocation in Proverbs 1:3, which see. Yea, every good path. \"Yea\" does not occur in the original. The expression is a summarizing of the three previous conceptions, as if the teacher implied that all good paths are embraced by and included in \"righteousness, and judgment, and equity;\" but the term is also comprehensive in the widest degree. The literal translation is \"every path of good\" (כְּל־מַעְגֻּל־טוב, cal-ma'gal-tov), i.e. every course of action of which goodness is the characteristic, or, as the Authorized Version, \"every good path,\" the sense in which it was understood by St. Jerome, omnem orbitam bonam. The word here used for \"path\" is מַעְגַּל (ma'gal), \"the way in which the chariot rolls\" (Delitzsch), and metaphorically a course of action, as in Proverbs 2:15; Proverbs 4:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-19. - Statement of the advantages which result from the possession of Wisdom, and specially as a safeguard against evil men (vers. 12-15) and evil women (vers 16-19). Verse 10. - When wisdom entereth into thine heart. There is practically little difference as to the sense, whether we render the Hebrew כִּיby the conditional \"if\" or by the temporal \"when\" as in the Authorized Version. The conditional force is adopted by the LXX. ἐάν and the Vulgate si. In the previous section of this address, the teacher has shown that the search after Wisdom will result in possession.; now he points out, when Wisdom is secured, certain advantageous consequences follow. The transition is easy and natural. The form of construction is very similar to that adopted previously. There is first the hypothesis, if we give this force to כִּי, though much shorter; and secondly the climax, also shorter and branching off into the statement of two special cases. Entereth; or, shall enter (חָבוא thavo) in the sense of permanent residence in the heart. Wisdom is not only to come in, but to rest there (cf. Proverbs 14:33). The expression is illustrated by John 14:23. The imagery of the verse is taken from the reception and entertainment of a guest. As we receive a welcome guest, and find pleasure in his company, so is Wisdom to be dear to the heart and soul. Into thine heart (בְּלִבֶּך, b'libecha). The heart (לֵב) \"concentrates in it. self the personal life of man in all its relations, the conscious and the unconscious, the voluntary and the involuntary, the physical and the spiritual impulses, the emotions and states\" (Cremer, 'Bib. Theol. Lex.,' sub voce καρδία). It is that in which the נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh),\"soul,\" manifests itself. It is the centre of the life of will and desire, of the emotions, and of the moral life. Rudloff ('Lehre von Menscher,' p. 59, sqq., apud Zockler) remarks that everywhere in the Scriptures the heart appears to belong more to the life of desire and feeling than to the intellectual activity of the soul. But at the same time, it is to be noted that intelligent conception is attributed to the heart (לֵב); Proverbs 14:10; Proverbs 8:5; Proverbs 16:9. The expression seems to be put here for the moral side of man's nature; and in the Hellenistic sense, καρδία, the proper equivalent of לֵב \"heart,\" involves all that stands for νοῦς λόγος συνείδησις, and θυμός; i.e. it includes, besides other things, the intellectual faculty. The word \"soul\" (נֶפֶשׁ, nephesh) is here found in combination with \"heart.\" The other passages where they are mentioned together are Deuteronomy 6:5; Psalm 13:2; Jeremiah 4:19; Proverbs 24:12. The soul is primarily the vital principle, but according to the usus loquendi of Holy Scripture, it frequently denotes the entire inward nature of man; it is that part which is the object of the work of redemption. The homo of the soul is the heart, as appears from Proverbs 14:10, \"The heart knoweth his own bitterness [or, 'the bitterness of his soul,' Hebrew].\" While the \"heart\" (לֵב) is rendered by καρδία and ψυχή, the only Greek equivalent to \"soul\" (וֶפֶשׁ) is ψυχή. The two expressions, \"heart,\" and \"soul,\" in the passage before us may be taken as designating both the moral and spiritual sides of man's nature. Wisdom is to be acceptable and pleasant to man in these respects. It may be remarked that an intellectual colouring is given to the word \"heart\" by the LXX., who render it by διανοία, as also in Deuteronomy 6:5 and other passages, evidently from the idea that prominence is given to the reflective faculty. Classically, διανοία ισ equivalent to \"thought,\" \"faculty of thought,\" \"intellect.\" Knowledge (Hebrew, דָעָת); literally, to know, as in Proverbs 8:10 and Proverbs 14:6; here used synonymously with \"wisdom.\" Knowledge, not merely as cognition, but perception; i.e. not merely knowing a thing with respect to its existence and being, but as to its excellence and truth. Equivalent to the LXX. αἰσσησις, \"perception,\" and the Vulgate scientia. Is pleasant (Hebrew, יִנְעָם, yin'am); literally, shall be pleasant; i.e. sweet, lovely, beautiful. The same word is used impersonally in Jacob's blessing of Issachar (Genesis 49:15, \"And he saw the land that it was pleasant\"), and also in Proverbs 24:25, \"To those that punish [i.e. the judges] there shall be delight.\" And this usage has led Dunn to take knowledge as an accusative of reference, and to translate, \"There is pleasure to thy soul in respect of knowledge;\" but the Authorized Version may be accepted as correct. \"Knowledge\" is masculine, as in Proverbs 8:10 and Proverbs 14:6, and agrees with the masculine verb \"is pleasant.\" Knowledge will be pleasant from the enjoyment and rest which it yields. The Arabic presents the idea of this enjoyment under a different aspect: \"And prudence shall be in thy soul the most beautiful glory.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDiscretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Discretion shall preserve thee. Discretion (מְזַמָּת m'zimoth), as in Proverbs 1:4, is the outward manifestation of wisdom; it tests what is uncertain, and avoids danger (Hitzig). The word carries with it the idea of reflection or consideration (see Proverbs 3:21; Proverbs 5:2; Proverbs 8:12) The LXX. reads, βουλὴ καλή, \"good counsel;\" and the Vulgate, concilium. Shall preserve thee. The idea of protection and guarding, which is predicated of Jehovah in ver. 8, is here transferred to discretion and understanding, which to some extent are put forward as personifications. Understanding (תְבוּנָה, t'vunah), as in Proverbs 2:11; the power of distinguishing and separating, and, in the case of conflicting interests, to decide on the best. Shall keep; i.e. keep safe, or in the sense of watching over or guarding. The two verbs \"to preserve\" (שָׁמַר shamar) and \"to keep\" (נָצַר, natsar), LXX. τήρειν, occur together again in Proverbs 4:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - To deliver thee from the way of the evil man. The first special advantage resulting from the protecting guardianship of discretion and understanding. From the way of the evil man; properly, from an evil way; Hebrew, מִדֶּרֶך רָע (midarek ra), not necessarily, though by implication, connected with man, as in the Authorized Version. רָע (ra), \"evil,\" \"wicked,\" in an ethical sense, is an adjective, as in Jeremiah 3:16 (לֵב רָע, lev ra), \"an evil heart;\" cf. the LXX., ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ κακῆς; the Vulgate, Targum, and Arabic, a vid mala, and the Syriac, a viis pravis. \"Way,\" is here used in the sense of \"conduct,\" and the evil way is a line of conduct or action which is essentially wicked or evil. The teacher has already Warned youth against the temptations and dangers of the way of evil men in Proverbs 1:10-15; he now shows that discretion, arising from wisdom being resident in the heart, will be a sufficient safeguard against its allurements. From the man that speaketh froward things. Perverse utterances are here brought in contradistinction to the evil way or froward conduct. Man (אִשׁ ish) is here used generically, as the representative of the whole class of base and wicked men, since all the following verbs are in the plural, Froward things. The word תַּהְפֻכוֹּת (tah'pucoth), here translated \"froward things,\" is derived from the root צּצּצּ (haphak), \"to turn,\" \"to pervert,\" and should be translated \"perverseness.\" Perverseness is the wilful misrepresentation of that which is good and true. The utterances are of a distorted and tortuous character. The word, only found in the plural, is abstract in form, and is of frequent, though not of exclusive, occurrence in the Proverbs. It is attributed to the Israelites in Deuteronomy 32:20. It is met with again in such expressions as \"the mouth of perverseness,\" Authorized Version \"froward mouth\" (Proverbs 8:13); \"the tongue of perverseness,\" \"froward tongue,\" Authorized Version (Proverbs 10:31); \"the man of perverseness,\" \"froward man,\" Authorized Version (Proverbs 16:28). What is here said of wicked men is attributed to drunkards in Proverbs 23:33, \"Thine heart shall utter perverse things.\" The expression finds its explanation in Proverbs 6:13, 14. The spirit which indulges in this perverseness is stubborn, scornful, self-willed, and rebellious, and it is from such a spirit that discretion is a preservative. In Job 5:13 it is said that \"the counsel of the froward is carried headlong\" (see also 2 Samuel 22:27; Psalm 18:26; Psalm 101:4). The LXX. rendering of this word is μηδὲν πιστόν, \"nothing trustworthy,\" which is amplified in the Arabic, quod nullam in se continet veritatem, \"that which contains in itself no truth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Who leave the paths of uprightness. Between vers. 13 and 15 the teacher proceeds to give a more detailed description of those who speak perversely. Who leave (הַעֹזְבִים haoz'vim); literally, forsaking, but the present participle has the force of the preterite, as appears from the context. The men alluded to have already forsaken or deserted the paths of uprightness (see previous note on the word \"man.\" The paths of uprightness (אָרְחות יֹשֶׁר ar'khoth yosher); the same as the \"right paths\" of ch. 4:11. The strict meaning of the Hebrew word translated \"uprightness\" is \"straightness,\" and hence it stands opposed to \"perverseness\" in the previous verse. Uprightness is integrity, rectitude, honest dealing. The LXX. translators represent the forsaking of the paths of uprightness as a consequence resulting from walking in the ways of darkness, \"O ye who have left the right ways by departing [τοῦ πορεύεσβαι, equivalent to abeundo] into the ways of darkness.\" Again, the ways of darkness (דַרְכֵי חשֶׁך, dar'chey kkoshek) are opposed to the \"paths of uprightness\" which rejoice in the light. Darkness includes the two ideas ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) ignorance and error (Isaiah 9:2; Ephesians 5:8), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) evil deeds.NEWLINENEWLINETo walk in the ways of darkness, then, is to persist in a course of wilful ignorance, to reject deliberately the light of knowledge, and to work wickedness, by performing \"the works of darkness (τὰ ἔργα τοῦ σκύτους),\" which St. Paul exhorted the Church at Rome to east away (Romans 13:12), and by having fellowship with \"the unfruitful works of darkness (τὰ ἔργα τὰ ἀκάρπα τοῦ σκότους),\" against which the same apostle warned the Ephesians (Ephesians 5:11). They are ways of darkness, because they endeavour to hide themselves from God (Isaiah 29:15) and from man (Job 24:15; Job 38:13, 15). In their tendency and end they lead to the blackness of darkness forever. In Scripture darkness is associated with evil, just as light is with uprightness (see John 3:19, 20). The same association of ideas is discoverable in the dualism of the Persian system, as formulated by Zoroaster - Ormuzd, the good principle, presides over the kingdom of light, while Ahriman, the principle of evil, is the ruler of the kingdom of darkness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Who rejoice to do evil. Another element is here brought forward, and the description increases in intensity. The wicked not only rejoice to do evil themselves, but they exult when they hear of evil in others (cf. Romans 1:32). Such may be the interpretation, though the latter part, of the verse is capable of a different and more general rendering as signifying exultation in evil generally, whether it appears in themselves or others. The expression rendered in the Authorized Version, in the frowardness of the wicked, is in the original (בְּתַחְפֻכות רַע b'thah'pucoth ra), in the perverseness of evil, or in evil perverseness, where the combination of the two nouns serves to give force to the main idea, which is that of perverseness. This rendering is adopted in the LXX., ἐπὶ διαστροφῇ κακῇ, \"in evil distortion;\" in the Vulgate, in pessimis rebus; in the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic, in conversatione mala, \"in a bad course of conduct;\" and in the Targum, in malitiae perversione, \"in the perversion of wickedness.\" It is not perverseness in its simple and common form that these men exult in. but in its worst and most vicious form (for a similar construction, see Proverbs 6:24; Proverbs 15:26; and Proverbs 28:5). How widely different is the conduct of charity, which \"rejoiceth not in iniquity\" (1 Corinthians 13:6)!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Whose ways are crooked; better, perhaps, who as to their ways are crooked. This is the construction adopted by Fleischer, Berthean, Zockler, and others, though it may be remarked that the substantive אֹרַח (orakh), \"way,\" is common gender, and may thin; agree with the adjective עֵקֵשׁ (ikesh), \"perverse,\" which is masculine. The Targum, LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, all make \"crooked\" agree with \"ways,\" do that, grammatically, the Authorized Version may be regarded as not incorrect. Crooked (עִקְּשִׁים ik'shim); i.e. tortuous, perverse, not straightforward, (σκολιαὶ, LXX.). Symmachus translates the original by σκαμβαί, i.e. \"bent.\" Theodotion, by στριβλαί, \"twisted, crookt? Sinners, in their perverseness, are ever winding about, turning in every direction, and changing from purpose to purpose, as wayward caprice or shifting inclination, the alternations of evil propensity, happen to dictate (Wardlaw). (For the expressions \"crooked ways,\" see Psalm 125:5.) And they froward in their paths; i.e. perverse in their paths. The root idea of the Hebrew niph. participle וּנְלוזִים (vun'lozim), translated \"and they froward,\" is \"to bend aside,\" \"to turn away.\" They are turned aside to the right hand and to the left in their walk. The niph. participle נָלוז (naloz) only occurs four times in the Scriptures - here; Proverbs 3:32; Proverbs 14:2; and Isaiah 30:12. This is the last feature in their wickedness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To deliver thee from the strange woman. This is the second form of temptation against which wisdom (discretion) is a preservative, and the great and especial dangers arising from it to youth, owing to its seductive allurements, afford the reason why the teacher is so strong in his warnings on this subject. Two terms are employed to designate the source of this evil - \"the strange woman\" (אִָשה זָרָה, ishshah zara), and \"the stranger\" (נָכְרִיָה, nok'riyah) - and both undoubtedly, in the passage before us, mean a meretricious person, one who indulges in illicit intercourse. The former term is invariably employed in this sense in the Proverbs (Proverbs 5:2, 20; Proverbs 7:5; Proverbs 22:14; Proverbs 23:33) of the adulteress (זָרִים, zarim), and Jeremiah 2:25. The participle זָר (zar), from the verb זוּר (zur), of which זָרָה (zarah) is the feminine form, is, however, used in a wider sense, as signifyingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) one of another nation, or one of another family;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) or some one different from one's self;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) or strange.NEWLINENEWLINEThus:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) in Isaiah 1:7 we have \"Strangers devour it (your land) in your presence;\" but in Exodus 30:33 \"the stranger\" is one not the high priest.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The \"stranger\" is another (Proverbs 11:15; Proverbs 14:10; Proverbs 20:16; Proverbs 27:2, 13).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The \"strange fire\" (אֵשׁ זָרָה, esh zarah) is the unlawful fire as opposed to the holy fire (Leviticus 10:1); the \"strange god\" (אֵל זָר, el zar) is the foreign god (Psalm 81:9). But the idea of foreign origin implied in the word is more strongly brought out in the next term, נָכְרִיָה (nok'riyah), on which Delitzsch remarks that it scarcely ever divests itself of a strange, foreign origin. This word is used to designate those \"strange women\" whom Solomon loved in his old age, and who turned his heart aside to worship false gods (1 Kings 11:1-8), \"outlandish women,\" as they are termed in Nehemiah 13:26; it designates \"the strange wives\" of Ezra 10, and Nehemiah 13:27; and is applied to Ruth the Moabitess (Ruth 2:10). Again, it has to be further observed that the laws of the Mosaic code against prostitution were of a most stringent nature (Leviticus 19:29; Leviticus 21:9; Deuteronomy 23:17), and no doubt served to maintain a higher standard of morality among Israelitish women than that observed among the Midianites, Syrians, and other nations. Strong prohibitions were directed against the intermarriage of Israelites with the women of the surrounding nations; but the example set by Solomon would serve to weaken the force of these prohibitions, and would lead to a large influx of women of a different nationality. The conclusion we arrive at is that the class mentioned in the text, though not Israelitish by birth, were yet so by adoption, as the context clearly indicates (ver. 17) the fact of marriage and the acceptance of certain religious observances. Such women, after a temporary restraint, would eventually set all moral and religious obligations at defiance. and would become the source of temptation to others. The allegorical interpretation given to this passage by the LXX. is to be rejected on the ground that the previous section (vers. 12-15) speaks of perverse men. Which flattereth with her words; literally, who has made smooth her words, the hiph. perfect being used of חָלַק (khalak), \"to make smooth,\" or \"flattering.\" The preterite shows what her habitual practice is, and is used of an action still continuing, and so may be fitly rendered by the present, as in the Authorized Version: \"She has acquired the art of enticing by flattering words, and it is her study to employ them;\" cf. the Vulgate, quae mollit sermones suos, \"who softens her words;\" and the Syriac, quae subvertit verba sua, \"who subverts her words,\" i.e. \"uses deceit.\" The expression occurs again in Proverbs 5:3; Proverbs 6:24; Proverbs 7:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The guide of her youth (נְעוּרֶיהָ אַלּוּפ, alluph n'ureyah); properly, the associate or companion of her youth. The Hebrew, אָלּוּפ (alluph), being derived from the root אָלַפ, (alaph), \"to accustom one's self to,\" or \"to be accustomed to\" or \"familiar with\" anyone. The word is rendered as \"friend\" in Proverbs 17:9; Proverbs 16:28; Micah 7:5. The idea of guidance, which is adopted in the Authorized Version, and appears also in the Vulgate dux. and Targum ducatus, is a secondary idea, and is derived probably from the relation in which the husband stands to his wife. Various interpretations have been given to the expression. It occurs again in Jeremiah 3:4, where Jehovah applies it to himself, and says, through his prophet, to the religiously adulterous Judah, \"Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the Guide of my youth (אַלּוּפ נְעֻרי, alluph n'ura)?\" It has also been understood as referring to the woman's parents, her father and mother, who were her natural guardians. But the context seems to require that it should be taken as designating her husband. It will then be the correlative of \"the wife of thy youth\" of Malachi 2:14. The covenant of her God; i.e. the marriage covenant, called \"the covenant of her God,\" because entered into in his presence. The forsaking of the guide of her youth is essentially bound up with a forgetfulness of the solemn covenant which she had entered into in the presence of God. No specific mention is made in the Pentateuch of any religious ceremony at marriage; yet we may infer, from Malachi 2:14, 15, where God is spoken of as \"a Witness\" between the husband and \"the wife of his youth,\" \"the wife of thy covenant,\" that the marriage contract was solemnized with sacred rites. The Proverbs thus give a high and sacred character to marriage, and so carry on the original idea of the institution which, under the gospel dispensation, developed late the principle of the indissolubility of the marriage tie. It is no objection to this view that the monogamic principle was infringed, and polygamy countenanced. The reason of this latter departure is given in Deuteronomy 22:28 and Exodus 22:16. The morality of the Proverbs always represents monogamy as the rule, it deprecates illicit intercourse, and discountenances divorce. It is in entire accordance with the seventh commandment. The woman who commits adultery offends, not only against her husband, but against her God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For her house inclineth unto death; rather, she sinks down to death together with her house (Bottcher, Delitzsch). The objection to the Authorized Version is that it does not tbllow the construction of the original, the verb \"sinks down\" (שָׁחָה, shakhah) being feminine, while \"house\" (בָיִת, bayith) is invariably masculine. Aben Ezra translates, \"She sinks down to death, (which is to be) her house;\" but it seems better to regard \"her house\" as an adjunct of the strange woman. Her house includes all who belong to her. She and they are involved in the same fate. The Authorized Version is evidently influenced by the Vulgate, Inclinata est enim ad mortem domus ejus, \"For her house is inclined to death.\" The LXX. gives a different rendering, Ἕθετο γὰρ παρὰ τῷ θανάτῳ τὸν οϊκον αὐτῆς, \"For she hath placed her house beside death.\" So the Arabic. The \"for\" (כִּי, ki) refers back to ver. 16, and indicates how great is the deliverance effected by wisdom. The meaning of the passage is aptly illustrated by Proverbs 7:27, \"Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.\" And her paths unto the dead. The dead (רְפָאִים, r'phaim) are properly the quiet, or the feeble. They are the shadowy inhabitants or shades of Hades, the inferi of the Vulgate, and are here put for Sheol itself. Compare the ἔδωλα καμνόντων of Homer, and the umbrae, \"shades,\" of Virgil. The word occurs again in Proverbs 9:18; Proverbs 21:16; and in Psalm 88:11; Isaiah 26:14, 19; Job 26:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - None that go unto her return again. The fate of the companions of the strange woman is described as irrevocable. All who visit her shall not return again. The Targum reads, \"They shall not return in peace.\" The difficulty which they who give themselves up to the indulgence of lust and passion encounter in extricating themselves makes the statement of the teacher an almost universal truth. Hence St. Chrysostom says, \"It is as difficult to bring back a libidinous person to chastity as a dead man to life.\" This passage led some of the Fathers to declare that the sin of adultery was unpardonable. Fornication was classed by the scholastic divines among the seven deadly sins, and it has this character given to it in the Litany: \"From fornication, and all other deadly sin.\" St. Paul says, \"No whoremonger nor unclean person...hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God\" (Ephesians 5:5; cf. 1 Corinthians 6:9; Revelation 22:15). The sin which they commit who have dealings with the strange woman is deadly and leads on to death, and from death there is no return, nor laying hold of or regaining the paths of life (see Job 7:9, 10).

Verse 20. - That (Hebrew, לְמַעַן l'maan); in order that (Vulgate, ut), carries us back properly to ver. 11. The protecting power of wisdom is developed in a positive direction. Negatively, it delivers from the evil man and from the strange woman, but it does more - \"it shall keep thee in order that thou mayest walk in a good way,\" etc. The Hebrew לְמַעַן (l'maan) is coordinate with \"to deliver thee,\" but it serves to bring the discourse to a conclusion. Umbreit renders it \"therefore,\" thus making what follows an inference from the preceding discourse. So the Syriac, ambula igitur, \"therefore walk.\" In the way of good men (בְּדֶרֶך טובִים, b'derek tovim); i.e. in the way of the good, in an ethical sense, i.e. the upright, as in Isaiah 5:20. The Vulgate renders, in via bona, \"in the good way.\" \"The way of good men\" is the way of God's commandments, the way of obedience. Keep. The Hebrew verb שָׁמַר (shamar) is here used in the sense of \"to observe,\" \"to attend to,\" but in a different sense from Psalm 17:4, \"I have observed the ways of the violent man,\" i.e. that I might avoid them. To keep the paths of the righteous is to carefully attend to the life of obedience which they follow. The LXX. closely connects this verse with the preceding, and renders, \"For if they had walked in good ways, they would have found the paths of righteousness light.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For the upright shall dwell in the land. Much the same language is met with in Psalm 37:29, \"The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.\" It is the secure and peaceful dwelling in the land which is intended (cf. Proverbs 10:30). To dwell in the land was always put forward as the reward of obedience to God's commandments (see Exodus 20:12; Leviticus 25:18; Leviticus 26:5), and the phrase conveyed to the Hebrew mind the idea of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of all temporal blessings. The love of country was a predominant characteristic of the race. Elster, quoted by Zockler, remarks, \"The Israelite was beyond the power of natural feeling, which makes home dear to every one, more closely bound to the ancestral soil by the whole form of the theocracy; torn kern it, he was in the inmost roots of life strained and broken. Especially from psalms belonging to the period of the exile this patriotic feeling is breathed out in the fullest glow and intensity.\" The land (אָרֶצ arets) was the promised land, the land of Canaan. The word is not used here in the wider sense in which it occurs in Matthew 5:5, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\" And the perfect shall remain in it; i.e. they shall not, as Rabbi Levi remarks, be driven thence nor caused to migrate. The perfect (תְמִימִים th'mimim), the holy (LXX., ὅσιοι), the spotless (immaeulati, Targum), those without a staid (qui sine labe, Syriae), the guileless (simplices, Vulgate). Shall remain; יִוָּתְרוּ (yivrath'ru), niph. future of יָתַר (yathar), properly \"to be redundant,\" and in the niph. form, \"to be left,\" or \"to remain.\" LXX., ὑπολειφθήσαντι \"shall remain;\" permanebunt, Vulgate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth. The punishment of the wicked is contrasted with the blessings that are promised to the upright. Shall be cut off; יִפָרֵתוּ (yikkarethu), niph. future of כָרַת (karath), \"to cut off, or destroy.\" LXX., ὀλοῦνται; Vulgate, perdentur.;The expression is used to convey the idea of extermination, as in Psalm 37:9 (cf. Job 18:17; Psalm 37:28; Psalm 104:35). The verb is found also in Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:15. The earth; properly, the land. The same word (אַרֶצ arets) is used as in ver. 21. The transgressors (בּוגְדִים, bog'dim); here employed synonymously with \"the wicked\" (יְשָׁעִים, y'shaim), \"the impious.\" The primary meaning of the verb from which it is derived (בָגַד, bagad) is \"to cover,\" \"to deal treacherously,\" and hence the word signifies those who act treacherously or perfidiously, the faithless. They are those who perfidiously depart from God, and break away from the covenant with Jehovah. LXX., παράνομοι (cf. Proverbs 11:3, 6; Proverbs 13:2, 25; Proverbs 22:12; Psalm 25:3; Psalm 59:5; Isaiah 33:1). Shall be rooted out (יסֶּחוּ, yiss'khu). This word is taken by Davidson as the future kal of נסַה (nasah), \"to pluck up,\" and hence is equivalent to \"they shall pluck up,\" or, passively, \"they stroll be plucked up.\" Delitzsch remarks that it is as at Proverbs 15:25 and Psalm 52:7, active, \"they shall pluck up,\" and this with the subject remaining indefinite is equivalent to the passive form, \"they shall be plucked up.\" This indefinite \"they\" can be used of God, as also in Job 7:3 (Fleischer). The expression has been understood as referring to being driven into exile (Gesenius), and this view would be amply justified by the fate which overtook the apostate nation when both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah suffered this fate (cf. LXX. ἐξωθήσονται, \"they shall be driven out\"). It also derives colour from the language of the preceding verse, but the imagery appears to be derived from the cutting down and rooting up of trees. The destruction of the wicked and transgressors will be complete. They shall be exterminated (cf. Targum, eradicabuntur; Syriac evellentur; and Arabic, exterminabuntur).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-33. - Part VII. FIRST APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing \"the words of Agur.\" A short introduction, teaching that the Word of God is the source of wisdom (vers. 1-6), is followed by apothegms on different subjects (vers. 7-33). Cornelius a Lapide offers the following opinion concerning this appendix, which no one can hesitate to say is well founded, if he attempts to give it a spiritual interpretation, and to discern mysteries under the literal meaning: \"Quarta haec pars elegantissima est et pulcherrima, aeque ac difficillima et obscurissima: priores enim tres partes continent Proverbia et Paraemias claras, ac antithesibus et similitudinibus perspicuas et illustres; haec vero continet aenigmata et gryphos insignes, sed arcanos et perdifficiles, turn ex phrasi quae involute est et aenigmatica, tum ex sensu et materia, quae sublimis est et profunda.\" Verse 1. - The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy. This seems to be the correct rendering of the passage, though it has been made to bear very different interpretations. It is plainly the tide of the treatise which follows Wire Agur and Jakeh were is utterly unknown. The Jewish interpreters considered that \"Agur son of Jakeh\" was an allegorical designation of Solomon - Agur meaning \"Gatherer,\" or \"Convener\" (see Ecclesiastes 1:1; Ecclesiastes 12:11); Jakeh, \"Obedient,\" or \"Pious,\" which thus would indicate David. St. Jerome somewhat countenances the alle gorical interpretation by translating, Verba Congregantis, filii Vomentis, \"The words of the Collector, son of the Utterer.\" But what follows could not apply to Solomon; he could not say, \"I have not learned wisdom\" (ver. 3), or ask blindly after the Creator (ver. 4). Many have endeavoured to find Agur's nationality in the word that follows, translated \"the prophecy\" (חַמַשָּׂא, hamassa). Massa \"burden,\" is usually applied to a solemn prophetical speech or oracle, a Divine utterance (Isaiah 13:1; Isaiah 15:1, etc.), and as this designation was deemed inappropriate to the character of this appendix, it has been thought that allusion is here made to a land of Massa, so called after a son of Ishmael (Genesis 25:14), who dwelt in the country of Edom or Seir, and whose inhabitants were among those children of the East whose wisdom had become proverbial (1 Kings 4:30). Others find Massa in the Hauran, or on the north of the Persian Gulf. The Venetian Version gives, Λόγοι Ἀγούρου υἱέως Ἰακέως τοῦ Μασάου. But we have no satisfactory account of a country thus called, and its existence is quite problematical; therefore the ingenious explanations founded on the reality of this terra ignota need not be specified (see Introduction, pp. 21, etc.). Gratz has suggested that in place of hamassa should be read hammoshel, \"the proverb writer;\" but this is a mere conjecture, unsupported by any ancient authority. If, as seems necessary, we are compelled to resign the rendering, \"of Masse,\" or \"the Massan,\" we must fall back on the Authorized Version, and consider the term \"oracle\" as applied loosely and abnormally to these utterances of wisdom which follow. That they are not of the nature of Divine communications can be seen at once by consideration of their contents, which are mainly of human, and not of the highest type, and, though capable of spiritual interpretation, do not possess that uniqueness of purpose, that religious character and elevation of subject, which one expects in the enunciations of an inspired prophet. This view does not militate against their claim to be regarded as Holy Scripture; their place in the canon is secured by other considerations, and is not affected by our suspicion of the inappropriateness of the term applied to them; and, indeed, it may be that the very human element in these utterances is meant to be unsatisfying, and to lead one to look for the deep spiritual truths which underlie the secular surroundings. Agur is some poet or moralist, well known in Solomon's time, probably one of the wise men referred to in Proverbs 24:23 (see below). The rest of the paragraph is of greater obscurity than the former portion. The man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal. According to this rendering, the man is Agur, who is introduced as uttering what follows in ver. 2, etc., to Ithiel and Ucal, two of his sons, pupils, or companions. The name Ucal occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament; Ithiel is found once, in Nehemiah 11:7, as the name of a Benjamite. Wordsworth regards the names as symbolical of the moral character of those whom the author designs to address, explaining the former as equivalent to \"God with me,\" and the latter as denoting \"consumed\" with zeal, or \"strong,\" \"perfect.\" It is as if the writer said, \"You must have God with you; yea, you must have God with you, if you are to be strong. You must be Ithiels, if you are to be Ucals.\" He refers to 1 Corinthians 15:10; 2 Corinthians 3:5; Philippians 4:13. That the Masorites regarded these words as proper names is evident; אֻכָל, indeed, can have no other application. The Syriac takes this view of the words; to the same opinion lean, more or less, the Jewish translators Aquila and Theodotion, Aben Ezra, Vatablus, Pagninus, and others, and it is the simplest and easiest solution of the difficulties which have been seen in the clause. But many modern commentators have declared against it; e.g., Hitzig, Zockler, Detitzsch, Bottcher, Nowack. The repetition of Ithiel seems unmeaning; one sees no reason why it should be repeated more than Ucal. The second verse begins with כִּי, which, as Hebraists agree, cannot stand abruptly at the commencement of a discourse, but rather establishes something that has preceded. But if we take the words in dispute as proper names, no statement to be confirmed has been made. We are, then, constrained to take them in another sense. St. Jerome translates them, writing, Visio quam locutus est vir, cum quo est Deus, et qui Deo secum morante confortatus. The LXX. (which in troduces vers. 1-14 of this chapter after Proverbs 24:23) gives, \"Those things saith the man to those who believe God, and I cease;\" τοῖς πιστεύουσι Θεῷ being the translation of the doubled Ithiel, equivalent to \"God with me,\" and ואכל (παύομαι) being considered to be a formation from the root כלה. Ewald takes the two words to be the name of one man, equivalent to \"God with me, so I am strong;\" in his own language, Mitmirgott - sobinich stark; but his idea of a dialogue between the rich mocker (vers. 2-4) and the humble believer (ver. 5-14) is not well founded, though a late editor, Strack, agreeing, considers that the only possible interpretation of these verses (2-4) is to make the speaker utter them as the outcome of his unbelief and scoffing, to which Agur answers in ver. 5. Under all circumstances, it has seemed to many scholars best to surrender the notion of proper names, and, altering the vocalization, to interpret, \"The oracle of the man, 'I have wearied myself, O God, I have wearied myself, O God,'\" or, as others say, \"about God.\" The utterance commences here, and not at ver. 2. The repetition forcibly expresses the laborious and painful investigation of the seeker after truth. The final word, vocalized וָאֵכִל, is rendered, \"And I have withdrawn;\" or, as Bickell, quoted by Cheyne, gives, v'lo ukal, \"I have not prevailed.\" We arrive thus at this interpretation: first comes the superscription, \"The words of Agur,\" etc., \"the oracle of the man;\" then begins the utterance, which opens with the melancholy avowal that, though he had longed and striven to know God, his nature, his attributes, his working, he had failed in this object, and expended his labour in vain. Both Agur, and Lemuel who is named in Proverbs 31:1, seem to have been persons not of Israelitish nationality, but dwelling in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and acquainted with the religion and sacred literature of the chosen people (see ver. 5). It is by no means unlikely that they were of the race of Ishmael, from which stock many wise men had risen, and where wisdom was so cultivated as to have become proverbial (see Jeremiah 49:7; Obadiah 1:8). In what follows Agur shows himself as a philosopher and a critic, but at the same time a firm believer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2 and 3 confirm what is said in ver. 1 concerning the fruitlessness of the investigation there mentioned; the more he sought and studied, the more conscious he became of his own ignorance and of God's incomreprehensibility. Verse 2. - Surely I am more brutish than any man \"Surely\" (ki) should be \"for\" (see note on ver. l). Cheyne, \"I am too stupid for a man;\" I am a mere irrational beast (comp. Proverbs 12:1; Psalm 73:22). And have not the understanding of a man. I am not worthy to be called a man, as I possess not the intellectual faculty which a man ought to have. This is not ironical, as if he did not desire the statement to be taken in its full sense, and meant to say, \"Of course it is my own stupidity that is in fault;\" but it is a genuine confession of incompetence to investigate the subject matter, which is too mysterious for his mental powers to penetrate. Thus Solomon acknowledges that he is but a little child, nod prays for an understanding heart (1 Kings 3:7, 9; comp. Wisd. 9:5; Matthew 11:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I neither learned wisdom.

Ecclesiastes 5:8; Ecclesiastes 12:1). The knowledge of the all holy God was beyond his grasp (Job 11:7, etc.). Theology is a higher science than metaphysics, and cannot be reached by that ladder. The LXX. gives an affirmative sense to this verse, \"God hath taught me wisdom, and I know the knowledge of the holy (ἁγίων).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The questions contained in this verse are such as compelled Agur to acknowledge his ignorance and nothingness before the thought of the glory and power of the great Creator. We may compare Job 38, etc. Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? Who is he that hath his seat in heaven, and doeth works on earth? Who is he whose universal providence is felt and experienced? Where is this mysterious Being who hides himself from human ken? Christ has said something like this, \"No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven\" (John 3:13); and St. Paul (Ephesians 4:9). In biblical language God is said to come down from heaven in order to punish, to aid, to reveal his will, etc. (Genesis 11:7; Psalm 18:9, etc.); and he returns to heaven when this intervention is finished (Genesis 17:22; Genesis 35:13). Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath the control of the viewless wind, so as to restrain it or release it at his pleasure? (Psalm 135:7; Amos 4:13). Septuagint, \"Who hath gathered the winds in his bosom (κόλῳ)?\" Who hath bound the waters in a garment? The waters are the clouds which cover the vault of heaven, and are held, as it were, in a garment, so that, in spite of the weight which they contain, they fall not upon the earth. As Job says (Job 26:8), \"He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.\" And again (Job 38:37), \"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?\" So the psalmist, \"Thou coveredst it [the earth] with the deep as with a vesture\" (Psalm 104:6). (See above, Proverbs 8:27, etc.) Who hath established all the ends of the earth? Who hath consolidated the foundations, and defined the limits, of the remotest regions of the earth? (comp. Job 38:4, etc.). The answer to these four questions is \"Almighty God.\" He alone can order and control the forces of nature. What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? or, if thou knowest. It is not enough to acknowledge the power and operation and providence of this mysterious Being; Agur longs to know more of his nature, his essence. He must have personality; he is not an abstraction, a force, a quality; he is a Person. What, then, is his name, the name which expresses what he is in himself? Men have different appellations for this Supreme Being, according as they regard one or other of his attributes: is there one name that comprehends all, which gives an adequate account of the incomprehensible Creator? The question cannot be answered affirmatively in this life. \"We know that if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is\" (1 John 3:2). The further question, \"What is his son's name?\" has given some difficulty. The LXX. has, \"What is the name of his children (τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτοῦ)?\" as if there was reference to Israel, the special children of God. But the original does not bear out this interpretation, which is also opposed to the idea of the enigma proposed. The inquiry might mean - Are we to apply to the Supreme Being the same notion of natural relationship with which we are familiar in the human family? But this seems a low and unworthy conception. Or the \"son\" might be primeval man (Job 15:7) or the sage; but the answer would not be satisfactory, and would not tend to solve the great question. There are two replies which can be made to Agur's interrogation. Looking to the marvellous description of Wisdom in Proverbs 8:22, etc., we may consider Wisdom to be a denotation of the Son of God, and the inquirer desires to know the name and nature of this personage, of whose existence he was certified. Or he may have arrived at a knowledge of the only begotten Son of God, as the idea of the Logos is more or less developed in the Book of Wisdom, in Philo's treatises, and in the Alexandrian school; and longs for more perfect knowledge. This, indeed, is hidden: \"He hath name written, which no one knoweth but he himself\" (Revelation 19:12). It is useless to put such question to a fellow man; no human mind can fathom the nature of the Godhead, or trace out its operations (Ecclus. 18:4, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Every word of God is pure. \"Word\" is here imrah, which does not occur elsewhere in our book, which is the case also with Eloah, the term used for \"God.\" Every declaration of God in the inspired record, the Torah, is pure, as if refined in the fire (Psalm 18:30). Vulgate, Omnis sermo Dei est ignitus; Septuagint, \"All the words of God are tried in the fire (πεπυρωμένοι).\" God's words are true, sincere, with no mixture of error, certain of accomplishment (comp. Psalm 12:6; Psalm 119:140). He is a shield. He is perfect protection to all those who, relying on the word of revelation, fly to him for refuge (see on Proverbs 2:7). The knowledge of God is obtained in two ways - by his revelation in his Word, and by the experience of those who trust in him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAdd thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Add thou not unto his words. God's will, as announced in revelation, is to be simply accepted and acted upon, not watered down, not overstrained. This injunction had already been given in the old Law (Deuteronomy 4:2; Deuteronomy 12:32); it is repeated in the New Testament with awful emphasis (Revelation 22:18, 19). No human speculations or traditions may be mingled with God's words; the glosses and explanations and definitions, affixed by rabbinical ingenuity to plain enactments, and proved to be false in morality and fatal to vital religion, are a commentary on the succeeding sentence, Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. The reproof is found in the consequences of such additions; the results to which they lead are such as show that no who asserts that these things are contained in the Word of God is a liar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTwo things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-9. - A mashal ode, containing two requests, and a rationale of the latter.

It is the first of Agur's numerical proverbs. Verse 7. - Two things have I required of thee. The personal pronoun applies to God, who, according to our interpretation, has been invoked in ver. 1; otherwise it stands without reference to anything preceding. Deny me not before I die; i.e. grant me these two things for the rest of my life. Septuagint, \"Take not grace (χάριν) from me before I die.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Here is the first request: Remove far from me vanity and lies. Shay, \"vanity,\" is inward hollowness and worthlessness, and \"lies\" are the expression of this in words. The prayer might indeed be taken as an entreaty against being polluted with the companionship of the evil, like \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;\" but it is best taken subjectively, as a supplication for personal truthfulness and sincerity in all relations both towards God and man. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Both extremes are deprecated: the mean is the safest and the happiest, Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:16. 424NEWLINENEWLINE\"Multa petentibusNEWLINEDesunt multa; bene est, cui deus obtulitNEWLINEParca, quod satis est, manu.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"The 'ever craving' is Want's slave and thrall;NEWLINEThe gods most wisely thus their gifts accord,NEWLINEGiving 'enough,' they amply give to all.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Stanley.) Theognis, 'Patron.,' 1155 -NEWLINENEWLINEΟὐκ ἔραμαι πλουτεῖν οὐδ εὔχομαι ἀλλὰ μοι εἴηNEWLINEΖῇν ἀπὸ τῶν π᾿λίγων μηδὲν ἔχοντι κακόνNEWLINENEWLINE\"I want not wealth; I only ask to liveNEWLINEOn frugal means without corroding care.\" Feed me with food convenient for me; literally, give me to eat the bread of my portion; that which by God s providence is determined for me (comp. Genesis 47:22, which speaks of the portion assigned for the support of the priests; Job 23:14; and below, Proverbs 31:15). It is natural to refer to τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν ἐπιούσιον of the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:11); but the idea is not the same. In the latter, bread for the needs of the coming day is meant; in our passage it is more indefinite, a casting one's self on the Divine love, in readiness to take what that love assigns. \"Having food and covering,\" says St. Paul (1 Timothy 6:8), \"we shall be therewith content.\" Septuagint, \"Appoint for me what is necessary and what is sufficient (τὰ δεόντα καὶ τὰ αὐτάρκη).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The reason for the latter prayer follows, unless, as some consider, the prayer is one, as if Agur asked, \"Take from me riches which lead to vanity, and poverty which leads to lying and deceit.\" In this case the ground of the request would embrace both parts of the petition. Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord (Jehovah)? Great wealth and temporal prosperity tempt to forgetfulness of God, to self-confidence and practical unbelief in Divine providence. Like Pharaoh, the haughty rich man asks with scorn, \"Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?\" (Exodus 5:2; comp. Deuteronomy 8:12, etc.; Job 21:14, etc.; Psalm 14:1). Septuagint, \"Lest being filled I become false, and say, Who seeth me?\" Or lest I be poor, and steal; lest my necessities lead to dishonesty. And take the name of my God in vain. The verb taphas means \"to grasp at, seize violently, handle roughly,\" and the sin intended may be either false swearing in denial of his theft and to escape punishment, or the arraignment of God's providence which has allowed him to fall into such distress. Titus Isaiah 8:21, \"They shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God.\" In view of the proverbs that follow, the clause seems to be best taken of the blasphemy attending on impatience and want of resignation to God's will (comp. Proverbs 19:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Accuse not a servant unto his master. Calumniate, slander not; μὴ καταλαλήσης, Theodotion; μὴ διαβάλης, Symmachus. Do not secretly bring a charge against a man's slave, and make his master suspicious of him; have a kind feeling for those in lowly condition, and do not render their lot more unbearable by insinuating false or frivolous accusations against them. Ewald and others would render, \"Entice not a servant to slander his master;\" but there is no need so to take the expression, as the hiph. of the verb is used in post-biblical Hebrew in the sense of \"to calumniate.\" The Septuagint has, \"Deliver not a servant into the hands of his master,\" which seems to refer to the treatment of runaway slaves (Deuteronomy 23:15). Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty, and have to atone for it. The slandered slave imprecates a curse on his slanderer, and, as the latter has incurred vengeance by his word or action, the curse will not fall harmless (Proverbs 26:2); God's righteous retribution will overtake him, and he shall suffer for it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-31 contain six groups of four sentences each, each quaternion having a certain connection in language and concinnity of idea. First (vers. 11-14) come four generations that are evil - four being taken as the symbol of universality. The sins herein specified had become so general that they affected the whole generation. Verse 11. - There is a generation that eurseth their father. The words, \"there is,\" are not found in the Hebrew, and the four subjects are without a predicate. Delitzsch calls the group \"a mutilated priamel,\" which is explained to be a kind of gnomic poetry containing a series of antecedents or subjects followed by an epigrammatic conclusion applicable to all the antecedents. In the present ease the conclusion is wanting, so that we are left in doubt whether the author meant merely to de. scribe classes of men in his own time or to affirm that such are abominable. Septuagint, \"A wicked generation curseth its father (ἔκγονον κακόν),\" which expression is repeated at each of the four verses. The first sin is that which offends against the commandment to honour and obey parents. This was judged worthy of death under the old Law (Exodus 21:17; see Proverbs 20:20, and note there). And doth not bless their mother. This is a litotes, \"not to bless\" being equivalent to \"to curse.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A generation that are pure in their own eyes (Proverbs 20:9). The second characteristic is hypocrisy and Pharisaical self-righteousness (see Luke 18:11). And yet are not washed from their filthiness; have not cleansed their heart by complete repentance, either because they have not examined themselves and know nothing of the real state of their conscience, or because they care nothing about it and will not regard it in its true light. There is a similar expression in Isaiah 4:4. Septuagint, \"A wicked generation judgeth themselves to be just, but have not washed themselves clean (τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπένιψεν).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A generation, oh, how lofty are their eyes! The third sin is pride and arrogance (see on Proverbs 6:17; 21:4). \"Lord,\" said the psalmist, \"my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty\" (Psalm 131:1). The prophet rebukes \"the stout heart of the King of Assyria and the glory of his high looks\" (Isaiah 10:12). Their eyelids are lifted up; in supercilious disdain. \"Inde Proverbio dicimus,\" says Erasmus ('Adag.'), \"attolli supercilium, fastidium indicantes\" (s.v. \"Arrogantia\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives. The fourth evil is insatiable cupidity, which leads to oppression and injurious treatment of the helpless and poor, which makes men as cruel and remorseless in destroying others and despoiling them of their substance, as the very steel which they use in their operations. Similarly, the psalmist speaks of his enemies as men \"whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword\" (Psalm 57:4; comp. Isaiah 9:12; Jeremiah 5:17). To devour the poor from off the earth; i.e. so as to be no more seen in the world. Amos 8:4, \"Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail\" (comp. Psalm 14:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - Having spoken of insatiate cupidity, the writer now introduces four things which are insatiable. The form of the apothegm is climacteric, mounting from two to three, and thence to four, like the famous passage in Amos 1:3, etc. (comp. Proverbs 6:16, though there is no special stress there laid on the last member of the climax; Job 5:19; Job 33:29; Ecclesiastes 11:2). Verse 15. - The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. The word \"crying\" is not in the Hebrew, which says, \"The alukah hath two daughters: Give! Give!\" The insatiable appetite of this creature is represented by two words, which are personified as daughters, whom the mother has produced and dearly loves. This word alukah is not found again in the Old Testament; but in later Hebrew and in Aramaic it means \"leech\" or \"bloodsucker;\" and so it is translated by the Septuagint, βδέλλα, and by St. Jerome sanguisuga. The word is derived from a root which in Arabic means \"to adhere.\" There are several kinds of leeches common in Palestine, and their bloodthirsty nature is well known; as Horace says, 'Ars Poet.,' 476 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris, hirudo.\" It seems simple and quite satisfactory to accept the word thus, and to see in the voracity of the leech an example of the greed further developed in the following clauses; but commentators have not been contented with this explanation, and have offered various suggestions which are either unnecessary or inadmissible. Thus the Talmud considers alukah to be an appellation of hell, and the two daughters to be the Power of the world, and Heresy. Some of the Fathers regard it as a symbol of the devil and his dominion; others, as a personification of cupidity with its two offshoots avarice and ambition. Some moderns deem it to mean a vampire or blood thirsty demon, a ghoul, in accordance with Eastern myth. But, as we have said, such interpretations are unnecessary and unsupported by sufficient authority. The allusion to the tastes of the leech is found elsewhere. Thus Theocritus, 'Idyll.,' 2:55 -NEWLINENEWLINEΑι} αι} ἔρως ἀνιαρέ τί μευ μέλαν ἐκ χροὸς αἵμαNEWLINEἘμφὺς ὡς λιμνᾶτις ἅπαν ἐκ βδέλλα πέπωκας And Plautus, 'Epidic.,' 2:2, 5 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Jam ego me convortam in hirudinem atqueNEWLINEEorum exsugebo sanguinem,NEWLINESenati qui columen cluent.\" Ewald and others find traces of mutilation in this proverb, and endeavour to supply what is lost in various ways; but the text as it stands is intelligible, and needs no addition. The rest of the verse is an application of the truth first stated. The type of cupidity there enunciated is instanced and exemplified in four special cases. There are three things that are never satisfied. And then a corrective climax is addressed. Yea, four things say not, It is enough. The four in the following verse are divided into two plus two. Septuagint, \"The leech had three daughters dearly beloved, and these three did not satisfy her, and the fourth was not contented to say, Enough.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The four insatiable things are now named: first, the grave, sheol (Proverbs 27:20), which can never be filled with its victims. Horace talks of a man as -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Victima nil miserantis Orci.\"NEWLINE(Carm.,' 2:3, 24.) And Hesiod ('Theog.,' 456) of Hades as -NEWLINENEWLINEΝηλεὲς ῆτορ ἔχωνNEWLINE\"A heart possessing that no pity knows.\" The second thing is the barren womb; \"the closing of the womb,\" as Genesis 20:18; Isaiah 66:9. The burning desire for children, characteristic of an Israelitish wife, is here denoted, like the passionate cry of Rachel to Jacob, \"Give me children, or else I die\" (Genesis 30:1). The barren woman, says Corn. a Lapide, \" concubitus magis est avida quam ceterae tum propter desiderium habendae prolis, tum quod foecundae et gravidae naturaliter non appetant concubitum.\" The third insatiable thing is the earth that is not filled (satisfied) with water; the parched and thirsty soil which no amount of water can satisfy, which drinks in all that is poured upon it and is not benefited, what Virgil ('Georg.,' 1:114) calls \"bibula arena.\" The fourth is the fire that saith not, It is enough; the \"devouring element,\" as the newspapers term it. The more you heap on fire, the more material you supply, the fiercer it rages. Septuagint, \"Hades, and the love of woman, and earth not satisfied with water, and water, and fire, will not say, It sufficeth.\" Cheyne and others quote from the Sanscrit 'Hitopadesa,' \"Fire is never satisfied with fuel; nor the ocean with rivers; nor death with all creatures; nor bright-eyed women with men.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - This is an independent proverb, only connected with the preceding by being founded on an allusion to an animal. The eye that mocketh at his father. The eye is named as the mind's instrument for expressing scorn and insubordination; it is the index to the inner feeling; and look may be as sinful as action. And despiseth to obey his mother; i.e. holds obedience to his mother to be a thing of no importance whatever. The word translated \"to obey\" (ליקהת) is rendered by St. Jerome partum; by others, \"weakness,\" or \"wrinkles,\" or \"old age,\" as Septuagint, γῆρας. But etymology has led most modern commentators to give the sense of \"obedience\" (see Genesis 49:10). The ravens of the valley shall pick it out. Such an undutiful son shall die a violent death; his corpse shall lie unburied, and the birds of prey shall feed upon him. It is well known that ravens, vultures, and other birds that live on carrion first attack the eyes of their prey; and in our own islands we are told crows and birds of this sort will fix on the eyes of young or sickly animals. Corn. a Lapide quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 108:5 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Effossos oculos voret atro gutture corvus,NEWLINEIntestina canes, cetera membra lupi.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"His eyes, plucked out, let croaking ravens gorge,NEWLINEHis bowels dogs, his limbs the greedy wolves.\" The valley, or brook, reminds one of Elijah's miraculous support (1 Kings 17:4). Young eagles. The nesher must here mean one of the vulture tribe, as eagles do not feed on carrion (but see Job 39:30). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:49) applies the proverb thus: \"'The eye that sneereth at his father, and despiseth the travail of his mother, lo! the ravens from the torrents shall pick it out.' For bad men, while they find limit with the judgments of God, do 'sneer at their Father;' and heretics of all sorts, whilst in mocking they contemn the preaching of holy Church and her fruitfulness, what else is this but that they 'despise the travail of their mother'? whom we not unjustly call the mother of them as well, because from the same they come forth, who speak against the same.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - A proverb concerning four inscrutable things, connected with the last by mention of the eagle. Verse 18. - There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not. The great point is the fourth, to which the three previous things lead up, all of them being alike in this, that they leave no trace. The facts are marvellous; Agur feels like Job, \"I have uttered that which I understood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not\" (Job 42:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The way of an eagle in the air. You cannot by any outward sign know that an eagle has passed this or that way. Wisd. 5:11, \"As when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found,\" etc. The way of a serpent upon a rock. The snake's mode of progression by the lever-like motion of its ribs might well awake surprise, but the point is still the tracklessness of its course. On sand or soft ground its movements might be traced by the impression made. but this could not be done on hard rock; it could push itself along on such a surface without leaving any track. The way of a ship in the midst (heart) of the sea; i.e. in the open sea. You can trace a ship's course while she is near land or within sight, but when she reaches the open sea, you can follow her furrow no longer. Wisd. 5:10, \"As a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves.\" The way of a man (geber) with a maid (בְּעַלְמָה); Septuagint, \"The ways of a man in youth (ἐν νεότητι).\" So Vulgate, Viam viri in adolescentia. But this is feeble, and almah is without doubt rightly rendered \"maid,\" \"virgin.\" The proverb says that the sinful act to which it alludes leaves no outward sign by which it can generally be recognized; it escapes man's knowledge. This is exemplified and confirmed in the following verse. It is not sufficient to refer the saying to the insidious arts of the seducer, by which he saps the principles and inflames the passions of his victim. The sin of unchastity is signified, which demands secrecy and affords no token of its commission. Two of the above parallels, says Cheyne, are given in a quatrain of a Vedic hymn to Varuna -NEWLINENEWLINE\"The path of ships across the sea,NEWLINEThe soaring eagle's flight he knows.\" Some of the Fathers and earlier commentators, and among moderns, Bishop Wordsworth, have not been content with the literal sense of this gnonic, but have found in it, as in the others, deep spiritual mysteries. Christ is the great Eagle (Revelation 12:14), who ascended beyond human ken; the serpent is the devil, who works his wily way in secret, and who tried to pass into the mind of Christ, who is the Rock; the ship is the Church, which preserves its course amid the waves of this troublesome world, though we cannot mark its strength or whither it is guided; and the fourth mystery is the incarnation of Jesus Christ our Lord, when \"the virgin (almah) conceived and bare a son\" (Isaiah 7:14), when \"a woman encompassed a man (geber)\" (Jeremiah 31:22). We can see the greater or less appropriateness of such accommodation, but the proverb must have been received by contemporaries only in its literal sense, whatever were the inner mysteries which the Holy Spirit wished to communicate thereby.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSuch is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This verse is a kind of gloss or illustration of the last thought of the preceding verse, and seems not to have formed an original part of the numerical proverb. It might well be placed in a parenthesis. Many commentators consider it to be an interpolation. Such is the way of an adulterous woman. What Agur had said of a man above, he now applies to the practised adulteress, whose sin cannot be traced. She eateth. This is a euphemism for the sin which she commits, \"Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant\" (Proverbs 9:17; comp. Proverbs 5:15). And wipeth her mouth, as if to leave no trace of her illicit repast. And saith, I have done no wickedness. As she has sinned in secret, and there is no outward proof of her guilt, she boldly denies it. Septuagint, \"Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who, when she has committed the act, having washed herself, says she has done nothing amiss.\" She forgets him who seeth in secret, and is quite content to escape detection at man's eyes, and to assume the character of a virtuous wife, which popular report assigns to her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-23. - Then follows a proverb concerning four things which are intolerable, examples of incongruous associations or positions - two in the case of men, two in the case of women. Verse 21. - For three things the earth is disquieted; better, under three things the earth doth tremble, as if oppressed by an overwhelming borden. The form of expression does not allow us to think of an earthquake. \"The earth\" is equivalent to \"the inhabitants thereof.\" And for four which it cannot bear; or, under four it cannot stand (comp. Amos 7:10). These four evils destroy the comfort of social life, uproot the bonds of society, and endanger the safety of a nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For a servant when he reigneth; or, under a slave when he becometh king. This startling vicissitude was not uncommon in Eastern states; and even if the slave was not preferred to regal power, he was often advanced by unwise favouritism to high position, for which he was wholly unfitted, and which he used only to aggrandize himself at the expense and to the injury of others, This incongruity has been already noticed at Proverbs 19:10 (where see note). And a fool when he is filled with meat. \"Fool\" is here nabal, a low, profligate fellow, who is rich and without care. When such a one rises to high position, or has power over others, he becomes arrogant, selfish, unbearable (comp. ver. 9; Proverbs 28:12; Proverbs 29:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For an odious woman when she is married; or, under an unloved woman when she is married. The sentence does not refer to an unbeloved wife, a Leah, becoming the favourite, a Rachel; the expression, \"when she is married,\" can hardly have this sense; but the gnome speaks of a woman who has passed much of her life without love, having nothing about her attractive either in looks, attainments, or manner, and is consequently soured and ill-tempered. If such a one does at last win a husband, she uses her new position to vex those who formerly depreciated her, and to make them as miserable as she cam And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. The maidservant that obtains her mistress's property, either by supplanting her or by right of inheritance, is supposed to make a bad use of it, to become conceited, arrogant, and odious to all around her. The LXX. transposes the last two members of the comparison, placing the unloved woman in the fourth place as the most intolerable of all: \"And if a maidservant should cast out (ἐκβάλη, Genesis 21:10) her own mistress, and a hateful woman should obtain a good husband.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-28. - Four things small and weak, and yet wise. Verse 24. - There be four things which are little upon the earth, in contrast with the intolerable pretensions of the last group. The Vulgate has minima; but the original is not superlative, which would not be true of some of the creatures named. But they are exceeding wise; \"quick of wit, wise,\" the participle מְחֻכִּמִים meaning \"rendered wise, cunning\" (Delitzsch). The Septuagint and Vulgate translate in the comparatives. \"These are wiser than the wise,\" the instincts of these animals being more marvellous than human wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The ants are a people not strong. The ant is proposed as an example to the sluggard (Proverbs 6:6, etc.). He calls the ants a people, am, because they live in a community, and have authorities which they obey, and their actions are regulated by certain definite laws. So Joel (Joel 1:6) calls the locusts a nation, and Homer ('Iliad,' 2:87) speaks of ἔθνεα μελισσάων ἀδινάων, \"the tribes of thronging bees.\" Yet they prepare their meat in the summer. In countries where ants hybernate the object of this commended foresight is mistaken; but the statement, as that in Proverbs 6:6-8, is in accordance with the popular belief of the day, and serves well to point the moral intended. We know certainly that in Europe these insects fill their nests with heterogeneous articles - grain, seeds, husks, etc., not as stores to be consumed in the winter, but for warmth and comfort's sake. Scripture is not intended to teach science; it speaks of such matters phenomenally, with no attempt at a precision which would not have been understood or appreciated by contemporaries. But in the present case more careful observation has confirmed the correctness of the asset. tions in our proverbs. In countries where, ants do not hybernate, they do make granaries for themselves in the summer, and use these supplies as food in the winter months (see note on Proverbs 6:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The conies are but a feeble folk. The term \"coney\" (cuniculus) is applied to the rabbit, but this is not the animal here intended; and indeed rabbits are not found in Palestine. The word shaphan designates the Hyrax Syriacus, called by some the rock badger (see Hatrt, 'Animals of the Bible,' pp. 64, etc.). The coney, says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 2:90), \"abounds in the gorge of the Kedron, and along the foot of the mountains west of the Dead Sea. It is of the size of the rabbit, but belongs to a very different order of animals, being placed by naturalists between the hippopotamus and rhinoceros. Its soft fur is brownish-grey over the back, with long black hairs rising through this lighter coat, and is almost white on the stomach; the tail is very short. The Jews, who were not scientific, deceived by the motion of its jaws in eating, which is exactly like that of ruminant animals, fancied it chewed the cud, though it did not divide the hoof, and so they put its flesh amidst that which was forbidden. It lives in companies, and chooses a ready-made cleft in the rocks for its home, so that, though the conies are but a 'feeble folk,' their refuge in the rocks gives them a security beyond that of stronger creatures. They are, moreover, 'exceeding wise,' so that it is very hard to capture one. Indeed, they are said, on high authority, to have sentries regularly placed on the look out while the rest are feeding; a squeak from the watchman sufficing to send the flock scudding to their holes like rabbits. The coney is found in many parts of Palestine, from Lebanon to the Dead Sea.\" In the rocks. This fact is noticed in Psalm'civ. 18. The Septuagint calls them χοιρογρύλλιοι here and Psalm 104:18, also in Leviticus 11:6 and Deuteronomy 14:7. This notion of the animal as a kind of little pig is not more accurate than that of St. Jerome, who renders the term by lepusculus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The locusts have no king (Proverbs 6:7), yet they show discipline, guidance, and order. They go forth all of them by bands; so that Joel (Joel 2:7, 8) speaks of them as a well-ordered army, as it were men of war, marching every one on his ways, not entangling their ranks, walking every one in his path. Septuagint, \"The locusts are without a king, yet march at one command in good order.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The spider taketh hold with her hands. Semamith or shemamith is some sort of lizard, probably the gecko. Καλαβώτης, Septuagint; stellio, Vulgate. The Authorized Version alludes either to its fanlike foot, which enables it to run up walls and to cling to ceilings, or to its power of exuding from its feet a certain poisonous humour by which it catches flies and other insects. But the above translation, as well as that of the Septuagint and the Vulgate manibus nititur, is incorrect, The first line, in accordance with the method pursued in the three cases previously, ought to give some expression denoting weakness or littleness, whereas by the above rendering it is rather strength and activity that are signified. The translation therefore should run, as in the Revised Version margin, \"The lizard thou canst seize with thy hand,\" and yet it is in king's palaces. Small as it is, and easy to catch and crush, it is agile and clever enough to make its way into the very palace of the king, and to dwell there. Septuagint, \"And the lizard, supporting itself by its hands, and being easy to catch (εὐάλωτος), dwelleth in kings' strongholds.\" This combines the two interpretations given above. St. Gregory takes the lizard as the type of the simple, earnest man, who often succeeds better than the clever. \"Many that are quick-witted, while they grow slack from carelessness, continue in bad practices, and the simple folk, which have no wing of ability to stand them in stead, the excellency of their practice bears up to attain to the walls of the eternal kingdom. Whereas, then, 'the lizard climbeth with his hands,' he 'is in kings' palaces;' in that the plain man, by earnestness of right practice, reaches that point whereunto the man of ability never mounts\" ('Moral.,' 6:12, Oxford transl.). The ancient expositors see in these verses a presentation of the Church of God, weak on its human side and despised by men, yet exceeding wise (1 Corinthians 1:27) - like the ant, laying up treasure in heaven, providing for death and eternity; like the coney, making the Rock her refuge; like the locusts, moving forward a mighty army in battle array; like the lizard, active in movement, holding the truth tenaciously, and dwelling in the palace of the great King.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-31. - Four things of stately presence.

The word here used for \"lion,\" laish, occurs elsewhere only in Job 4:11 and Isaiah 30:6. The LXX. renders it, \"a lion's whelp.\" \"Strongest\" is gibbor, a mighty one, a hero. Turneth not away for any; Septuagint, \"turneth not away, nor feareth any beast.\" So Job describes the war horse, \"He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed, neither turneth he back from the sword\" (Job 39:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - A greyhound; זַרְזִיר מָתְנַיִם (zarzir mothnayim), \"girt in the loins\" (περιεσφιγμένος τὴν ὀσφόν, Symmachus), an expression very vague, and, as the name of an animal, occurring nowhere else in the Old Testament. In post-biblical Hebrew zarzir is found as the name of some pugnacious bird, and the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac call it here the cock. So also Aquila and Theodotion. But if the word is onomatopoetic, it would seem to apply with more propriety to one of the raven tribe; and then what is to be made of the allusion to the loins? And how comes it that amid the quadrupeds in the gnome a bird should suddenly be introduced, as one stately in going? It seems certain that some quadruped is here meant, but what? What animal has as characteristic tight-girded loins or slender or active loins? There are, indeed, many that might be so designated, but none that, as far as we know, appropriated this unique appellation. Hence various opinions are held by commentators concerning the identification. The zebra, say some, with its stripes, which may be thus denoted; the war horse, say others, comparing Job 39:19, 25, and considering the trappings with which, as we see in ancient sculptures, he was adorned; others, again, fix upon the leopard as the beast intended. But that of the Authorized Version seems, on the whole, to be the most likely rendering, the slender, agile make of the greyhound having given cause for the appropriation of the term used in the text. Delitzsch compares the German word windspiel, which designates the greyhound without the necessity of using the full term, wiadspielhund. The only points which may be considered adverse to this view are these two, viz. the ill repute in which dogs were held by the Hebrews, Scripture consistently disparaging and despising them; and the fact that, as far as we have information, the Jews did not use dogs for hunting purposes, though nowadays the Arabs keep a kind of Persian greyhound for sporting, and Assyrian monuments have familiarized us with the appearance of hounds employed in the chase of the lion and the wild ox. Agur may be referring to what he has seen elsewhere, but what was well known to these for whom he wrote. Gesenius suggests (253), \"a warrior girt in the loins,\" which is adopted by Wordsworth, and gives a suitable idea. This would correspond with the king in the last line; but the interpretation is quite arbitrary, and supported by no ancient authority, resting on the fact that girding the loins is always spoken of human beings. The cock strutting among his hens is, as we have hinted, the idea which approves itself to many ancient translators. Thus the Septuagint, ἀλέκτωρ ἐμπεριπατῶν θηλείαις εὔψυχος. We are not disposed to adept this identification, more especially as common poultry were unknown in Palestine till long after Solomon's time. Certainly what we call cocks and hens, or barn door fowls, are never mentioned in the Old Testament. and seem to have been introduced from Persia after the rise of the Persian empire. The latest editors decide for the war horse; but the conflicting claims cannot be reconciled, and the matter must be left undetermined. An he goat also. This is a very natural comparison, as the stately manner in which the he goat (tay-ish, \"the butter\") heads the flock has been always observed. The LXX. expresses this, paraphrasing, \"and the he goat leading the herd.\" \"Flocks of goats are very numerous in Palestine at this day, as they were in former ages. We see them everywhere on the mountains, in smaller or larger numbers; at times also along with sheep, as one flock, in which ease it is usually a he goat that is the special leader of the whole, walking before it as gravely as a sexton before the white flock of a church choir\" (Geikie, 'Holy Land,' 1:232). A king, against whom there is no rising up; Vulgate, nec est rex qui resistat ei, which ought to mean \"and a king whom nothing resists,\" but can scarcely be compelled to produce this meaning without violence. The difficulty in the sentence arises from the word אַלקוּם, which in the above rendering is regarded as composed of the negative al, and kum, the infinitive, \"to rise against, oppose.\" But this is contrary to grammatical usage, and would be a solecism. To some it has seemed that a proper name was intended, and they have invented a King Alkum or Alkimos, whom they suppose to have been celebrated in or after Solomon's time. Many modern commentators take the word to be an Arabic expression, consisting of al, the definite article, and kum, \"people,\" and consider the meaning to be \"a king with whom is the people,\" i.e. surrounded by his people or army. This is certainly a stately sight, and may well stand parallel to the hero lion among beasts, and the bold he goat at the head of the flock. Other Arabic expressions may probably be found elsewhere in this chapter; e.g., vers. 15, 16, 17, aluka, etc. Septuagint, \"a king haranguing before a nation (δημηγορῶν ἐν ἔθνει).\" This passage, again, has been taken in a spiritual sense as referring to Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Warrior girt with the sword, the Leader of the flock, the King of kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - Agur's last proverb, exhorting to discreet demeanour. Verse 32. - If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself (Numbers 16:3). If thou hast had the folly to be arrogant, proud, and overbearing in conduct. Or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. The verb zamam, though possibly used in a bad sense, \"to devise evil,\" is more suitably rendered \"to meditate,\" \"purpose;\" so here it is the thought of lifting up one's self that is censured, the act and the thought being contrasted. Hast thou acted arrogantly, or even only meditated doing so, restrain yourself, keep silence (Job 21:5; Job 40:4). St. Jerome gives a different rendering, enforcing another lesson, \"There is one who shows himself a fool after he is raised to high position; if he had had understanding, he would have laid his hand on his mouth.\" Septuagint, \"If thou give thyself up to mirth, and stretch forth thy hand in a quarrel, thou wilt be dishonoured.\" Insensate mirth and a quarrelsome disposition alike lead to disgrace. St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:10) applies the Vulgate rendering to antichrist, \"For he in truth will be lifted up on high, when he will feign that he is God. But he will appear a fool when lifted up on high, because he will fail in his very loftiness through the coming of the true Judge. But if he had understood this, he would have laid his hand on his mouth; that is, if he had foreseen his punishment, when he began to be proud, having been once fashioned aright, he would not have been raised up to the boastfulness of such great pride\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs30:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter. The same word, mits, is used for \"churning,\" \"wringing,\" and \"forcing;\" it means \"pressure\" in all the cases, though with a different application. At the present day milk is churned in the East by enclosing it in a leathern bottle, which is then suspended in the air and jerked to and fro till the butter is produced. This process could scarcely be called \"pressure,\" though, possibly, the squeezing of the udder is meant, as the Septuagint and Vulgate take it. But most probably the reference is to cheese, the term used, chemah, being applied indifferently to curdled milk and cheese. To produce this substance, the curdled milk is put into little baskets of rush or palm leaves, tied closely, and then pressed under heavy stones. What the proverb says is that, as the pressure applied to milk produces cheese, and as pressure applied to the nose brings blood, so the pressure of wrath bringeth forth strife; the irritation and provocation of anger occasion quarrels and contentions. They say in Malabar, remarks Lane, \"Anger is a stone cast into a wasp's nest.\" Septuagint, \"Press out milk, and there shall be butter; and if thou violently squeeze the nostrils, blood will come forth; and if thou draw forth words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes.\" It is the third clause which is important, and to which the others lead up; and the verse must be taken in connection with the preceding, as enforcing the duty of self-restraint and silence under certain circumstances. Some of the Fathers, commenting on the Vulgate rendering (Qui fortiter premit ubera ad eliciendum lac, exprimit butyrum; et qui vehementer emungit, elicit sanguinem), apply the passage to the handling of the Word of God. Thus St Gregory ('Moral.,' 21:3), \"Divine sentences require sometimes to be viewed externally, sometimes to be explored internally. For we 'press the udder strongly' when we weigh with minute understanding the word of sacred revelation, by which way of pressing whilst we seek milk, we find butter, because, whilst we seek to be fed with but a little insight, we are anointed with the abundance of interior richness. Which, nevertheless, we ought neither to do too much, nor at all times, lest, while milk is sought for from the udder, there should follow blood. For very often, persons, whilst they sift the words of sacred revelation more than they ought, fall into a carnal apprehension. For 'he draws forth blood who wringeth violently.' Since that is rendered carnal which is perceived by an overgreat sifting of the spirit\" (Oxford transl.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - Part VIII. SECOND APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing \"the words of Lemuel\" on the subjects of impurity and intemperance. Verse 1. - The superscription. The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him. Who is intended by \"Lemuel king\" is much disputed. Those who connect the following word massa (\"oracle\") with the preceding melek (\"king\"), translate \"King of Massa,\" as Proverbs 30:1 (where see note). Of the country, or the king, or his mother, we have absolutely no information. The name Lemuel, or Lemoel (ver. 4), means \"unto God,\" i.e. dedicated to God, like Lael (Numbers 3:24); hence it is regarded by many authorities, ancient and modern, as an appellation of Solomon, one from infancy dedicated to God and celled by him Jedidiah, \"beloved of the Lord\" (2 Samuel 12:25). But there is nothing in the contents of this section to confirm this idea; indeed, there are expressions which militate against it. Possibly Hezekiah may be meant, and his remarkable piety somewhat confirms the opinion; yet we see no reason why he should be here addressed under a pseudonym, especially if we consider that he himself was concerned in making this collection. On the whole, it seems best to take Lemuel as a symbolical name, designating an ideal king, to whom an ideal mother addressed the exhortation which follows. Solomon's own proverbs contain many warnings against the very sins of which this mother speaks, so that the section is conceived in the spirit of the earlier portion of the book, though it is assigned to a different author and another age. The prophecy (massa); the inspired utterance (see on ch. 30:1). This maternal counsel forms one compact exhortation, which might with more propriety be so termed than the words of Agur. His mother. The mother of a reigning king was always regarded with the utmost respect, taking precedence of the king's wife. Hence we so often find the names of kings' mothers in the sacred record; e.g. 1 Kings 2:19; 1 Kings 14:21; 1 Kings 15:2; 2 Kings 12:1. It is difficult to say what reading was seen by the LXX., who render, \"My words have been spoken by God, the oracle of a king whom his mother instructed.\" There are many wise women mentioned in Scripture; e.g. Miriam, Deborah, the Queen of Sheba, Huldah, etc., so there is nothing incongruous in Lemuel being instructed by his mother in wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-9. - Here follows the exhortation, which seems to come from the same source as the \"burden\" of Agur above. In this section the connection and parallelism of the parts are exhibited by repetition of thought and often of words in the several clauses. Verse 2. - What, my son? Mah, \"what,\" is repeated thrice, both to enforce the attention of the son, and to show the mother's anxious care for his good. She feels the vast importance of the occasion, and asks as in perplexity, \"What shall I say? What advice shall I give thee?\" \"Son\" is here not ben, but bar, one of the Aramaic forms which are found in these two last chapters. The word occurs also in Psalm 2:12. Son of my vows. This might mean, \"son who wast asked in prayer,\" like Samuel (1 Samuel 1:11), and dedicated to God, as the name Lemuel implies; or it may signify, \"thou who art the object of my daily vows and prayers.\" Septuagint, \"What, my son, wilt thou observe (τηρήσεις)? What? the sayings of God. My firstborn son, to thee I speak. What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Exhortation to chastity. Give not thy strength unto women (comp. Proverbs 5:9). Chayil is \"vigour,\" the bodily powers, which are sapped and enervated by sensuality. The Septuagint has σὸν πλοῦτον; the Vulgate, substantiam tuam; but the prayerful, anxious mother would consider rather her son's personal well being than his worldly circumstances, which, indeed, an Eastern monarch's licentiousness would not necessarily impair. Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings; or, with a slight alteration in the punctuation (and an improved parallelism), to them that destroy kings; \"expugnatricibus regum,\" as Schultens terms them. Women are meant; and the prince is enjoined not to surrender his life, conduct, and actions to the influence of women, who, both by the dissipation and sensuality which they occasion, and the quarrels which they provoke, and the evil counsels which they give, often ruin kings and states (see the injunction, Deuteronomy 17:11). The Vulgate rendering, ad delendos reges, looks as if the warning was against making wars of conquest against neighbouring kings; but this is not a satisfactory parallel to the former clause. Septuagint, \"Give not thy wealth unto women, nor thy mind, nor thy life unto remorse (ὑστεροβολίαν). Do all things with counsel; drink wine with counsel.\" This seems to belong to the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - The second admonition. A warning against inebriety, and concerning a proper use of strong drink. Verse 4. - It is not for kings; or, as others read, far be it from kings. The injunction is repeated to indicate its vast importance. Nor for princes strong drink; literally, nor for princes (the word), Where is strong drink? (see on Proverbs 20:1; and comp. Job 15:23). The evils of intemperance, flagrant enough in the case of a private person, are greatly enhanced in the case of a king, whose misdeeds may affect a whole community, as the next verse intimates. St. Jerome reads differently, translating, \"Because there is no secret where drunkenness reigns.\" This is in accordance with the proverb, \"When wine goes in the secret comes out;\" and, \"Where drink enters, wisdom departs;\" and again, \"Quod latet in mente sobrii, hoc natat in ore ebrii.\" Septuagint, \"The powerful are irascible, but let them not drink wine.\" \"Drunkenness,\" says Jeremy Taylor ('Holy Living,' ch. 3, § 2), \"opens all the sanctuaries of nature, and discovers the nakedness of the soul, all its weaknesses and follies; it multiplies sins and discovers them; it makes a man incapable of being a private friend or a public counsellor. It taketh a man's soul into slavery and imprisonment more than any vice whatsoever, because it disarms a man of all his reason and his wisdom, whereby he might be cured, and, therefore, commonly it grows upon him with age; a drunkard being still more a fool and less a man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This gives a reason for the warning. Lest they drink, and forget the Law. That which has been decreed, and is right and lawful, the appointed ordinance, particularly as regards the administration of justice. Septuagint, \"Lest drinking, they forget wisdom.\" And pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted; literally, of all the sons of affliction; i.e. the whole class of poorer people. Intemperance leads to selfish disregard of others' claims, an inability to examine questions impartially, and consequent perversion of justice. Isaiah (Isaiah 5:23) speaks of intoxication as inducing men to \"justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - There are cases where strong drink may be properly administered. Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish (Job 29:13; Job 31:19). As a restorative, a cordial, or a medicine, wine may he advantageously used; it has a place in the providential economy of God. \"Use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities,\" was St. Paul's advice to Timothy (1 Timothy 5:23). It is supposed to have been in consideration of the injunction in the text that the ladies of Jerusalem provided for criminals on their way to the place of execution a drink of medicated wine, which might deaden the pain of suffering. This was the draught rejected by Christ, who willed to taste the full bitterness of death (Matthew 27:34; Mark 15:23). The Septuagint has, \"to those that are in sorrow;\" so the Vulgate, maerentibus, but this makes the two clauses tautological. Wine unto those that be of heavy hearts (Job 3:20). \"Wine,\" says the psalmist, \"maketh glad the heart of man\" (Psalm 104:15). Says Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:261 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Great is the strengthNEWLINEWhich generous wine imparts to wearied men.\" Wine, says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in Ephes.,' 19), \"has been given us for cheerfulness, not for drunkenness. Wouldest thou know where wine is good?

The \"dumb\" is any one who for any reason whatever is unable to plead his own cause; he may be of tender age, or of lowly station, or ignorant, timid, and boorish; and the prince is enjoined to plead for him and defend him (comp. Job 29:15). In the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction; literally, the sons of passing away (Isaiah 2:18); i.e. not orphans, children whose parents have vanished from the earth, nor strangers from a foreign country, nor, generally, mortals, subjects of frail human nature (all of which explanations have been given), but persons who are in imminent danger of perishing, certain, if left unaided, to come to ruin (comp.

THIRD APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION. This section contains an ode in praise of the virtuous woman, derived from a different source from that of the words of Agur, and belonging to a different age (see Introduction). It is an acrostic; that is, each verse begins with one of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, arranged in the usual order. We may compare this mashal with the alphabetical psalms, \"Psalmi abcedarii,\" which are, more or less, of similar structure, but of which one only, the hundred and nineteenth, is so marked in the English versions. Other examples are Psalm 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 145; also Lamentations 1, 2, and 3. One object of this artificial construction was to render the matter easier to commit to memory. The spiritual expositors see in this description of the virtuous woman a prophetic representation of the Church of Christ in her truth and purity and influence. Thus Bode: \"Hic sapientissimus regum Salomon laudes sanctae Ecclesiae versibus paucis sed plenissima veritate depingit.... Cujus (carminis) ordine perfectissimo alphabeti typice innuitur, quam plenissime hic vel animae cujusque fidelis, vel totius sanctae Ecclesiae, quae ex omnibus electis animabus una perficitur Catholica, virtutes ac praemia describantur.\" Verse 10. - ALEPH. Who can find a virtuous woman? The expression, ishshah chayil, \"woman of force,\" has occurred in ch. 12:4 (where see note). Mulierem fortem, St. Jerome terms her; γυναῖκα ἀνδρείαν is the rendering of the LXX., which places this section as the end of the whole Book of Proverbs. The expression combines the ideas of moral goodness and bodily vigour and activity. It is useless to try to fix the character upon any particular person. The representation is that of an ideal woman - the perfect housewife, the chaste helpmate of her husband, upright, God-fearing, economical, wise. See an anticipation of this character (Proverbs 18:22; Proverbs 19:14); and a very different view (Ecclesiastes 7:26). It is very remarkable to meet with such a delineation of woman in the East, where the female generally occupies a most degraded position, and is cut off from all sphere of activity and administration. To paint such a portrait needed inspiration of some sort. Such a one is hard to find. Her price is far above rubies; or, pearls (see on Proverbs 20:15 and Proverbs 3:15). Septuagint, \"Such a one is more valuable than precious stones.\" There may be allusion to the custom of giving treasure in exchange for a wife, purchasing her, as it were, from her friends (comp. Hosea 3:2). At any rate, few only are privileged to meet with this excellent wife, and her worth cannot be estimated by any material object, however costly. St. Jerome, with a slight difference in the reading, has, Procul, et de ultimis finibus pretium ejus. You may go to the ends of the earth to find her equal in value.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - BETH. The heart of her husband cloth safely trust in her. The husband of such a wife goes forth to his daily occupations, having full confidence in her whom he leaves at home, that she will act discreetly, and promote his interests while he is absent (see the contrast in Proverbs 7:20). So that he shall have no need of spoil; rather, he shall not lack gain (shalal). The wife manages domestic concerns so well that her husband finds his honest gains increase, and sees his confidence profitably rewarded. Septuagint, \"Such a woman shall want not fair spoils.\" It is obvious to see in this an adumbration of the Church winning souls from the power of the enemy, especially as shalal is used for an enemy's spoils (Psalm 68:12; Isaiah 53:12; and elsewhere).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - GIMEL. She will do him good and not evil (comp. Ecclus. 26:1-3). She is consistent in her conduct towards her husband, always pursuing his best interests. All the days of her life; in good times or bad, in the early spring time of young affection, and in the waning years of declining age. Her love, based on high principles, knows no change or diminution. The old commentator refers to the conduct of St. Monies to her unbelieving and unfaithful husband, narrated by St. Augustine in his 'Confessions,' 9:9: \"Having been given over to a husband, she served him as her lord; and busied herself to win him to thee, revealing thee to him by her virtues, in which thou madest her beautiful, and reverently amiable, and admirable to her husband.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - DALETH. She seeketh wool, and flax. She pays attention to these things, as materials for clothing and domestic uses. Wool has been used for clothing from the earliest times (see Leviticus 13:47; Job 31:20, etc.), and flax was largely cultivated for the manufacture of linen, the processes of drying, peeling, hackling, and spinning being well understood (see Joshua 2:6; Isaiah 19:9; Jeremiah 13:1, etc.). The prohibition about mixing wool and flax in a garment (Deuteronomy 22:11) was probably based on the idea that all mixtures made by the art of man are polluted, and that what is pure and simple, such as it is in its natural state, is alone proper for the use of the people of God. And worketh willingly with her hands; or, she worketh with her hands' pleasure; i.e. with willing hands. The rendering of the Revised Version margin, after Hitzig, \"She worketh at the business of her hands,\" is feeble, and does not say much. What is meant is that she not only labours diligently herself, but finds pleasure in doing so, and this, not because she has none to help her, and is forced to do her own work (on the contrary, she is represented as rich, and at the head of a large household), but because she considers that labour is a duty for all, and that idleness is a transgression of a universal law. Septuagint, \"Weaving (μηρυομένη) wool and flax; she makes it useful with her hands.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - HE. She is like the merchants' ships. She is like them in that she extends her operations beyond her own immediate neighbourhood, and bringeth her food from afar, buying in the best markets and on advantageous terms, without regard to distance, and being always on the look out to make honest profit. Septuagint, \"She is like a ship trading from a distance, and she herself gathereth her livelihood.\" The expressions in the text point to active commercial operations by sea as well as land, such as we know to have been undertaken by Solomon, Jehoshaphat, and others (1 Kings 9:26; 1 Kings 22:48), and such as the Hebrews must have noticed in the Phoenician cities, Sidon and Tyre.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - VAV. She riseth also while it is yet night. Before dawn she is up and stirring, to be ready for her daily occupation. A lamp is always kept burning at night in Eastern houses, and as it is of very small dimensions, the careful housewife has to rise at midnight to replenish the oil, and she often then begins her household work by grinding the corn or preparing something for next day's meals (comp. ver. 18). Early rising before any great undertaking is continually mentioned in Scripture (see Genesis 19:2; Genesis 22:3; Psalm 57:8; Jeremiah 7:13; Jeremiah 25:4, etc.; Mark 16:2; John 20:1). And giveth meat to her household; deditquae praedam domesticis suis, Vulgate. The word for \"meat\" is tereph, which means \"food torn in pieces\" with the teeth (Psalm 111:5), and hence food to be eaten. The wife thus early prepares or distributes the food which will be wanted for the day. And a portion to her maidens. Chok, \"final portion,\" may apply either to work or food. The Vulgate has cibaria, \"meat;\" Septuagint, ἔργα, \"tasks.\" The former, which is in accordance with Proverbs 30:8, would be merely a repetition of the second clause, the meat mentioned there being here called the allotted portion, and would be simply tautological. If we take it in the sense of \"appointed labour,\" we get a new idea, very congruous with the housewife's activity (comp. Exodus 5:14, where the same word is used in the case of the enforced labour of the Israelites).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - ZAYIN. She considereth a field, and buyeth it. She turns her attention to a certain field, the possession of which is for some cause desirable; and, after due examination and consideration, she buys it. One is reminded of Christ's parable of the treasure hidden in a field, which the finder sold all that he had to purchase (Matthew 13:44). With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. Her prudent management and economy give her means to buy vines and plant a vineyard, and thus to increase her produce. Possibly it is meant that she sees the field she has gotten is more fitted for grapes than corn, and she cultivates it accordingly. Virgil 'Georg.,' 2:229 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Altera frumentis quoniam favet, altera Baccho,NEWLINEDensa magis Cereri, rarissima quaeque Lyaeo.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - KHETH. She girdeth her loins with strength (ver. 25). This seems at first sight a strange assertion to make concerning one of the weaker sex; but the phrase is metaphorically expressive of the energy and force with which she prepares herself for her work. Strength and vigour are, as it were, the girdle which she binds round her waist to enable her to conduct her operations with case and freedom. So we have a similar metaphor boldly applied to God (Psalm 93:1): \"The Lord reigneth, he is apparelled with majesty; the Lord is apparelled, he hath girded himself with strength\" (cf. Job 38:3). Strengtheneth her arms. By daily exercise she makes her arms firm and strong, and capable of great and continued exertion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - TETH. She perceiveth that her merchandise is good; Vulgate, Gustavit et vidit quia bona est negotiatio ejus, where the paraphrase, \"she tastes and sees,\" expresses the meaning of the verb taam here used. Her prudence and economy leave her a large surplus profit, which she contemplates with satisfaction. There is no suspicion of arrogance or conceit, The pleasure that is derived from duty done and successfully conducted business is legitimate and healthy, a providential reward of good works. Septuagint, \"She tastes that it is good to work.\" This comfort and success spur her on to further and more continued exertion. Her candle (lamp) goeth not out by night. She is not idle even when night falls, and outdoor occupations are cut short; she finds work for the hours of darkness, such as is mentioned in the next verse. One recalls Virgil's picture of the thrifty housewife ('AEneid,' 8:407) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Inde ubi prima quies medio jam noctis abactaeNEWLINECurriculo expulerat somnum, cum femina primum,NEWLINECui tolerare colo vitam tenuique MinervaNEWLINEImpositum, cinerem et sopitos suscitat ignis,NEWLINENoctem addens operi, famulesque ad lumina longoNEWLINEExercet penso.\" Some take the lamp here in an allegorical sense, as signifying life, happiness, and prosperity, as Proverbs 13:9 and Proverbs 20:20; others, as denoting a bright example of diligence and piety (Matthew 5:16). But the simple meaning seems to be the one intended. Wordsworth notes that the passage in Revelation 18, which speaks of the \"merchandise\" of the false Church, also affirms that \"the light of a candle\" shall shine in her no more, the two metaphors in our passage applied to the true Church being there applied to Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - YODH. She layeth her hands to the spindle. כִּישׁור. (kishor, a word not occurring elsewhere) is probably not the spindle, but the distaff, i.e. the staff to which is tied the bunch of flax from which the spinning wheel draws the thread. To this she applies her hand; she deftly performs the work of spinning her flax into thread. Her hands hold the distsaff. פֶלֶך (pelek) is the spindle, the cylindrical wood (afterwards the wheel) on which the thread winds itself as it is spun. The hands could not be spared to hold the distaff as well as the spindle, so the first clause should run, \"She stretches her hand towards the distaff.\" In the former clause kishor occasioned some difficulty to the early translators, who did not view the word as connected with the process of spinning. The Septuagint translates, \"She stretches out her arms to useful works (ἐπὶ τὰ συμφέροντα);\" Vulgate, Manum suam misit ad fortia. So Aquila and Symmachus, ἀνδρεῖα. This rather impedes the parallelism of the two clauses. There was nothing derogatory in women of high rank spinning among their maidens, just as in the Middle Ages noble ladies worked at tapestry with their attendants. We remember how Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, was found sitting in the midst of her handmaids, carding wool and spinning (Livy, 1:57). Catullus, in his 'Epithal. Pel. et Thet.,' 312, describes the process of spinning ?NEWLINENEWLINE\"Laeva colum molli lana retinebat amictum;NEWLINEDextera tum leviter deducens fila supinisNEWLINEFormabat digitis; tum prono in pollice torquensNEWLINELibratum tereti versabat turbine fusum.\"NEWLINE(Carm.,' 64.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - CAPH. She is not impelled by selfish greed to improve her means and enlarge her revenues. She is sympathizing and charitable, and loves to extend to others the blessings which have rewarded her efforts. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor. \"Hand\" is here caph, \"the palm,\" evidently containing alms. She knows the maxim (Proverbs 19:17), \"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord,\" etc.; and she has no fear of poverty. Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. \"Hand,\" is here yod, with its nerves and sinews ready for exertion (see on Proverbs 10:4); and the idea is that she puts forth her hand to raise and soothe the poor man, not being satisfied with dealing alms to him, but exercising the gentle ministries of a tender love. Septuagint, \"She opens her hands to the needy, and reaches forth her wrist (καρπὸν) to the poor.\" Like Dorcas, she is full of good works and alms deeds (Acts 9:36). It is doubtless implied that the prosperity which she experiences is the reward of this benevolence (Proverbs 22:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - LAMED. She is not afraid of the snow for her household. \"Show,\" says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land,' 2:58), \"covers the streets of Jerusalem two winters in three, but it generally comes in small quantities, and soon disappears. Yet there are sometimes very snowy winters. That of 1879, for example, left behind it seventeen inches of snow, even where there was no drift, and the strange spectacle of snow lying unmelted for two or three weeks was seen in the hollows on the hillsides. Thousands of years have wrought no change in this aspect of the winter months, for Bennaiah, one of David's mighty men, 'slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow' (2 Samuel 23:20).\" She has no fears concerning the comfort and health of her family even in the severest winter. For all her household are clothed with scarlet; with warm garments. The word used is שָׁנִים (shanim), derived from a verb meaning \"to shine,\" and denoting a crimson or deep scarlet colour. This colour was supposed, and rightly, to absorb and retain heat, as white to repel it; being made of wool, the garments would be warm as well as stately in appearance. St. Jerome has duplicibus (shenaim), \"with double garments,\" i.e. with one over the other. Warm garments were the more necessary as the only means of heating rooms was the introduction of portable chafing dishes containing bunting charcoal (see Jeremiah 36:22, etc). The Septuagint has taken liberties with the text, \"Her husband is not anxious concerning domestic matters when he tarries anywhere [χρονίζη for which Delitzsch suggests χιονίζ], for all her household are well clothed.\" Spiritually, the Church fears not the severity of temptation or the chill of unbelief, when her children take refuge in the blood of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - MEM. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry (marbaddim); as Proverbs 7:16 (where see note). Pillows for beds or cushions are meant, though the translators are not of one mind on the meaning. St. Jerome has, stragulatam vestem; Aquila and Theodotion, περιστρώματα, Symmachus, ἀμφιτάπους, \"shaggy on both sides;\" Septuagint, \"She makes for her husband double garments (δισσὰς χλάινας).\" Her clothing is silk and purple. שֵׁשׁ (shesh) is not \"silk,\" but \"white linen\" (βύσσος, byssus) of very fine texture, and costly. Purple garments were brought from the Phoenician cities, and were highly esteemed (see Song of Solomon 3:10; Jeremiah 10:9). The wife dresses herself in a way becoming her station, avoiding the extremes of sordid simplicity and ostentatious luxury. \"For my own part,\" says St. Francois de Sales, quoted by Lesetre, \"I should wish any devout man or woman always to be the best dressed person in the company, but at the same time, the least fine and affected, and adorned, as it is said, with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. St. Louis said that every one ought to dress according to his position, so that good and sensible people should not be able to say you are overdressed, nor the younger under dressed\" ('Vie Devot.,' 3:25). So the Church is clothed in fine linen, clean and white, even the righteousness which Christ bestows (Revelation 19:8), and invested in her Lord's royal robe, who hath made her children kings and priests unto God (Revelation 1:6; Revelation 5:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - NUN. Her husband is known in the gates. Such a woman advances her husband's interests, increases his influence, and, by attending to his domestic concerns, enables him to take his share in public matters, so that his name is in great repute in the popular assemblies at the city gates (ver. 31; ch. 8:3). She is indeed \"a crown to her husband\" (ch. 12:4). When he sitteth among the elders of the land. Homer introduces Nausikaa speaking to her father of her duty to see that he is honourably clad when he goes to the council -NEWLINENEWLINEΚαὶ δὲ σοὶ αὐτῷ ἔοικε μετὰ πρώτοισιν ἐόνταNEWLINEΒουλὰς βουλεύειν καθαρὰ χροί εἵματ ἔχονταNEWLINE('Odyssey,' 6:60.)NEWLINENEWLINE\"For our costly robes,NEWLINEAll sullied now, the cleansing stream require;NEWLINEAnd thine especially, when thou appear'stNEWLINEIn council with the princes of the land,NEWLINEHad need be pure.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Cowper.) St. Gregory sees here an adumbration of the day of judgment: \"For the Redeemer of mankind is the \"Husband\" of holy Church, who shows himself 'renowned' (nobilis, Vulgate) in the gates. Who first came in sight in degradation and in mockings, but shall appear on high at the entering in of his kingdom; and 'he sitteth among the elders of the land,' for that he shall decree sentence of condemnation together with the holy preachers of that same Church, as himself declares in the gospel (Matthew 19:28)\" ('Moral.,' 6:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - SAMECH. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it. The word for \"fine linen\" is sadin, not the same as in ver. 22. but equivalent to σινδών, and denoting linen garments; Delitzsch calls it \"body linen\" (comp. Judges 14:12, 13; Isaiah 3:23). Delivereth girdles unto the merchant; literally, unto the Canaanite; i.e. the Phoenician merchant, a generic name for all traders (see Isaiah 23:8; Zechariah 14:21). Girdles were necessary articles of attire with the flowing robes of Eastern dress The common kind were made of leather, as is the use at the present day; but a more costly article was of linen curiously worked in gold and silver thread, and studded with jewels and gold (see 2 Samuel 18:11; Daniel 10:5). So Virgil (AEneid,' 9:359) speaks of \"aurea bullis cingula.\" We read of Queen Parysatis having certain villages assigned her for girdle money, εἰς ζώνην δεδομέναι (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:4, 9). Cicero alludes to the same custom in his Verrine oration (Proverbs 3:33): \"Solere aiunt barbaros reges Persarum ac Syrorum plures uxores habere, his autem uxoribus civitates attribuere hocmodo: haec civitas mulieri iu redimiculum proebeat, haec in collum, haec in crines\" (comp. Plato, 'Alcib. I.,' p. 123, B). Such rich and elaborately worked girdles the mistress could readily barter with Phoenician merchants, who would give in exchange purple (ver. 22) and other articles of use or luxury. On this passage St. Gregory thus moralizes: \"What is signified by a garment of fine linen, but the subtle texture of holy preaching? In which men rest softly, because the mind of the faithful is refreshed therein by heavenly hope. Whence also the animals are shown to Peter in a linen sheet, because the souls of sinners mercifully gathered together are enclosed in the gentle quiet of faith. The Church therefore made and sold this fine garment, because she inparted in words that faith which she had woven by belief; and received from unbelievers a life of upright conversation. And she delivered a girdle to the Canaanite, because by the might of the righteousness she displayed, she constrained the lax doings of the Gentile world, in order that that might be maintained in their doings which is commanded. 'Let your loins be girded about'\" ('Moral.,' 33:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStrength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - AYIN. Strength and honour are her clothing (ver. 17); ἰσχὺν καὶ εὐπρέπειαν, Septuagint. She is invested with a moral force and dignity which arm her against care and worry; the power of a righteous purpose and strong will reveals itself in her carriage and demeanour. And thus equipped, she shall rejoice in time to come; or, she laugheth (Job 5:22; Job 39:7) at the future (Isaiah 30:8). She is not disquieted by any fear of what may happen, knowing in whom she trusts, and having done her duty to the utmost of her ability. The Greek and Latin versions seem to take the expression as referring to the day of death; thus the Vulgate, Ridebit in die novissimo; Septuagint, \"She rejoices in the last days (ἐν ἡμέραις ἐσχάταις).\" But it is best interpreted as above. The true servant of God is not afraid of any evil tidings, his heart being fixed, trusting in the Lord (Psalm 112:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - PE. She openeth her mouth with wisdom. She is not merely a good housewife, attending diligently to material interests; she guides her family with words of wisdom. When she speaks, it is not gossip, or slander, or idle talk, that she utters, but sentences of prudence and sound sense, such as may minister grace to the hearers. The Septuagint has this verse before ver. 25, and the first hemistich Again. after ver. 27. So in Lamentations 2, 3, 4, the pe and ayin vetoes change places. This is also the case in Psalm 37. In the former passage the LXX: renders, \"She openeth her mouth heedfully and lawfully (προεχόντως καὶ ἐννόμως);\" and in the other, \"wisely and in accordance with law (σοφῶς καὶ νομοθέσμως).\" In her tongue is the law of kindness (thorath chesed); i.e. her language to those around her is animated and regulated by love. As mistress of a family, she has to teach and direct her dependents, and she performs this duty with gracious kindness and ready sympathy. Septuagint, \"She places order on her tongue.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - TSADE. She looketh well to the ways of her house; the actions and habits of the household. She exercises careful surveillance over all that goes on in the family. Eateth not the bread of idleness; but rather bread won by active labour and conscientious diligence. She is of the opinion of the apostle who said \"that if any would not work, neither should he eat\" (2 Thessalonians 3:10). Septuagint, \"The ways of her house are confined (στεγναὶ διατριβαὶ οἴκων αὐτῆς), and she eats not idle bread.\" The first of these clauses may mean that the proceedings of her household, being confined to a narrow circle, are readily supervised. But the meaning is very doubtful; and Schleusner renders, \"continuae conversationes in aedibus ejus.\" St. Gregory applies our verse to the conscience, thus: \"She considers the ways of her house, because she accurately examines all the thoughts of her conscience. She eateth not her bread in idleness, because that which she learned out of Holy Scripture by her understanding, she places before the eyes of the Judge by exhibiting it in her works\" ('Moral.,' 35:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - KUPH. Her children arise up, and call her blessed. She is a fruitful mother of children, who, seeing her sedulity and prudence, and experiencing her affectionate care, celebrate and praise her, and own that she has rightly won the blessing of the Lord. Her husband also, and he praiseth her; in the words given in the next verse. Having the approbation of her husband and children, who know her best, and have the best opportunities of judging her conduct, she is contented and happy. Septuagint, \"Her mercy (ἐλεημοσύνη) raises up her children, and they grow rich, and her husband praises her.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - RESH. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. The versions and some commentators take the encomium in the mean and restricted sense of praise for the acquisition of riches. Thus the Vulgate, Multae filiae congregaverunt divitias; Septuagint, \"Many daughters have obtained wealth.\" But it adds another rendering, \"Many have wrought power (ἐποίησανδύναμιν),\" which is nearer the meaning in this place. Chayil (as we have seen, ver. 10) means \"force,\" virtus, \"strength of character\" shown in various ways (comp. Numbers 24:18; Psalm 60:12). \"Daughters,\" equivalent to \"women,\" as Genesis 30:13; Song of Solomon 6:9. Roman Catholic commentators have, with much ingenuity, applied the whole description of the virtuous woman, and especially the present verse, to the Virgin Mary. We may regard it as a representation of the truly Christian matron, who loves husband and children, guides the house, is discreet, chaste, good, a teacher of good things (1 Timothy 5:14; Titus 2:3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFavour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - SHIN. The writer confirms the husband's praise by assigning to it its just grounds. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain. Chen, \"favour,\" may signify either the good will with which one is regarded, or gracefulness, beauty. As being in close parallelism with the next words, it is best taken as referring to loveliness of form. Mere gracefulness, if considered as a token of a wife's work and usefulness, is misleading; and beauty is transitory and often dangerous. Neither of them is of any real value unless accompanied by religion. As the gnomic poet says -NEWLINENEWLINEΜὴ κρῖν ὁρῶν τὸ κάλλος ἀλλὰ τὸν τρόπον.NEWLINE\"Judge not at eight of beauty, but of life.\" But a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. So we come back to the maxim with which the whole book began, that the foundation of all excellence is the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 1:7). Such, too, is the conclusion of Ecclesiastes (Ecclesiastes 12:13), \"Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\" Septuagint, \"False are charms (ἀρεσκειαι), and vain is the beauty of woman; for a prudent woman is blessed, and let her praise the fear of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs31:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - TAV. Give her of the fruit of her hands. So may she enjoy the various blessings which her zeal, prudence, and economy have obtained. Psalm 128:2, \"Thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.\" Septuagint, \"Give her of the fruit of her lips.\" And let her own works praise her in the gates. She needs no farfetched laudation; her life long actions speak for themselves. Where men most congregate, where the heads of the people meet in solemn assembly, there her praise is sung, and a unanimous verdict assigns to her the highest honour. Septuagint, \"Let her husband be praised in the gates.\" This frequent introduction of the husband is cuprous. St. Gregory thus spiritualizes the passage: \"As the entrance of a city is called the gate, so is the day of judgment the gate of the kingdom, since all the elect go in thereby to the glory of their heavenly country.... Of these gates Solomon says, 'Give her of the fruit of her hands, and her own works shall praise her in the gates.' For holy Church then receives of 'the fruit of her hands,' when the recompensing of her labour raises her up to the possession of heavenly blessings; for her 'works then praise her in the gates,' when in the very entrance to his kingdom the words are spoken to his members, 'I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat,' etc.\" ('Moral.,' 6:9).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-18. - 4. Fourth admonitory discourse. The third chapter introduces us to a group of admonitions, and the first of these (vers. 1-18) forms the fourth admonitory discourse of the teacher. To all intents and purposes this is a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter, for inasmuch as that described the benefits, spiritual and moral, which follow from the pursuit of Wisdom, in promoting godliness and providing safety from evil companions, so this in like manner depicts the gain flowing from Wisdom, the happiness of the man who finds Wisdom, and the favour which he meets with both with God and man. The discourse embraces exhortations to obedience (vers. 1-4), to reliance on God (vers. 5, 6) against self-sufficiency and self-dependence (vers. 7, 8), to self-sacrificing devotion to God (vers. 9, 10), to patient submission to God's afflictive dispensations (vers. 11, 12), and concludes with pointing out the happy gain of Wisdom, her incomparable value, and wherein that value consists (vers. 13-18). It is noticeable that in each case the exhortation is accompanied with a corresponding promise of reward (vers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and these promises are brought forward with the view to encourage the observance of the duties recommended or enjoined. Jehovah is the central point to which all the exhortations converge. Obedience, trust, self-sacrificing devotion, submission, are successively brought forward by the teacher as due to God, and the persons in whom they are exhibited are truly happy in finding Wisdom. The transition in thought from the former to the latter part of the discourse is easy and natural. Obedience and trust are represented as bringing favour, guidance, and health - in a word, prosperity. But God is not only to be honoured in times of prosperity, but also in adversity his loving hand is to be recognized; and in this submission to his will is true wisdom. Verse 1. - My son (b'ni) serves to externally connect this discourse with the preceding. Forget not my law. This admonition bears a strong resemblance to that in Proverbs 1:8, though the terms employed are somewhat different, torah and mits'oth here occupying the place respectively of musar and torah in that passage. My law (torathi), is literally, my teaching, or doctrine, from the root yarah, \"to teach.\" The torah is the whole body of salutary doctrine, and designates \"Law\" from the standpoint of teaching. Forgetting here is not So much oblivion arising from defective memory, as a wilful disregard and neglect of the admonitions of the teacher. Thine heart (libekha); Vulgate, cor; LXX., καρδία and so the sum total of the affections. Keep; yitstsor, from notsar, \"to keep, or observe that which is commanded.\" The word is of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, and appears about twenty-five times. My commandments (mits'othay); Vulgate, praecepta mea; LXX., τὰ ῤήματα μου; i.e. my precepts. The Hebrew verb from which it is derived means \"to command, or prescribe.\" The law and commandments here alluded to are those which immediately follow, from ver. 3 onwards. The three main ideas combined in this verse are remembrance, affection, and obedience. Remembering the law or teaching will depend, to a large extent, on the interest felt in that law; and the admonition to \"forget not\" is an admonition to give \"earnest heed,\" so that the law or teaching may be firmly fixed in the mind. In using the words, \"let thy heart keep,\" the teacher goes to the root of the matter. There may be an historical remembrance of, or an intellectual assent to, the commandments, but these are insufficient, for the keeping of the commandments must be based on the recognition of the fact that the affections of the heart are to be employed in the service of God, the keeping of the commandments is to be a labour of love. Again, the expression, \"keep my commandments,\" implies, of course, external conformity to their requirements: we are \"to observe to do them\" (Deuteronomy 8:1); but it implies, further, spiritual obedience, i.e. an obedience with which love is combined (Deuteronomy 30:20), and which arises from the inward principles of the heart being in harmony with the spirit of the commandments (see Wardlaw).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Length of days (orek yamim); Vulgate, longitudo dierum. The expression is literally \"extension of days,\" and signifies the prolongation of life, its duration to the appointed limit - a meaning which is brought out in the LXX. μῆκος βίου, \"length of days,\" the Greek word βίος being used, not of existence, but of the time and course of life. It occurs again in ver. 16, and also in Job 12:12 and Psalm 21:4. \"Length of days\" is represented as a blessing in the Old Testament, depending, however, as in the present instance, on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Thus in the fifth commandment it is appended to the honouring of parents (Exodus 20:12), and it was promised to Solomon, at Gibeon, on the condition that he walked in the way, statutes, and commandments of God (1 Kings 3:14). The promise of prolongation of life is not to be pressed historically as applying to every individual case, but is to be taken as indicating the tendency of keeping the Divine precepts, which, as a rule, ensure preservation of health, and hence \"length of days.\" Long life (vush'noth khayyim); literally, years of life; Targum Jonathan, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, anni vitae; LXX., ἔτη ζωῆς. The Authorized Version scarcely serves to bring out the sense of the original, as there is practically no difference in meaning between \"length of days\" and \"long life? The idea conveyed in the expression, \"years of life,\" is that of material prosperity. The thought of an extended life is carried on from the preceding expression, but it is amplified and described. The years of life will be many, but they will be years of life in its truest sense, as one of true happiness and enjoyment, free from distracting cares, sickness, and other drawbacks. The Hebrew plural, khayyim, \"lives,\" is equivalent to the Greek expression, βίος βιωτός, \"a life worth while living\" (cf. Plat., 'Apol.,' 38, A). To the Israelitish mind, the happiness of life consisted in \"dwelling in the land\" (Deuteronomy 4:40; Deuteronomy 5:30, etc.), and \"abiding in the house of the Lord\" (Psalm 15:1; Psalm 23:6; Psalm 27:3) (Zockler). The conjecture that the plural, khayyim, signifies the present and the future life, is unfounded. The scope of the promise before us is confined to the present stage of existence, and it is negatived also by the similar use of the plural in Proverbs 16:5, \"In the light of the king's countenance is life (khayyim),\" where khayyim cannot possibly refer to the future life. Khayyim stands for life in its fulness. \"Godliness\" has indeed, as St. Paul wrote to Timothy, \"promise of the life that now is, aud of that which is to come\" (1 Timothy 4:8). Peace (shalom). The verb shalam, from which the substantive shalom is derived, signifies \"to be whole, sound, safe,\" and hence \"peace\" means internal and external contentment, and tran-quillity of mind arising from the sense of safety. In ver. 17 the ways of Wisdom are designated peace. While, on the one hand, peace is represented by the psalmist as the possession of those who love God's Law (Psalm 119:165), on the other, it is denied the wicked (Isaiah 48:22; Isaiah 57:21). Shall they add to thee; i.e. shall the precepts and commands bring (Zockler) or heap upon (Muffet) thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Mercy and truth (khesed vermeth); properly, love and truth; Vulgate, misericordia et veritas; LXX., ἐλεημοσύναι καὶ πίστεις. With this verse begin the commandments which are alluded to in ver. 1. The Hebrew khesed has to be understood in its widest sense, though the Vulgate and the LXX. confine it to one aspect of its meaning, viz. that which refers to the relation of man to man, to the pity evoked by the sight of another's misfortunes, and to ahnsgiving. The radical meaning of the word is \"ardent desire,\" from the root khasad, \"to eagerly or ardently desire.\" Delitzsch describes it as \"well affectedness.\" Predicated of God, it indicates God's love and grace towards man; predicated of man, it signifies man's love toward s God, i.e. piety, or man's love towards his neighbour, i.e. humanity. Where this mercy or love is exhibited in man it finds expression inNEWLINENEWLINE(1) mutual outward help;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) forgiveness of offences;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) sympathy of feeling, which leads to interchange of thought, and so to the development of the spiritual life (see Elster, in loc.).NEWLINENEWLINEThe word carries with it the ideas of kindlim as, benignity (Targum, benignitas), and grace (Syriac, gratia). Truth (emeth); properly, firmness, or stability, and so fidelity in which one performs one's promise. Truth is that absolute integrity of character, beth in word and deed, which secures the unhesitating confidence of all (Wardlaw). Umbreit and Elster designate it as inward truthfulness, the pectus rectum, the very essence of a true man. As khesed excludes all selfishness and hate, so emeth excludes all hypocrisy and dissimulation. These two virtues are frequently combined in the Proverbs (e.g. Proverbs 14:22; Proverbs 16:16; Proverbs 20:28) and Psalms (e.g. Psalm 25:10; Psalm 40:11; Psalm 57:4-11; Psalm 108:5; Psalm 138:2), and, when predicated of man, indicate the highest normal standard of moral perfection (Zockler). The two ideas are again brought together in the New Testament phrase, ἀληθεύειν ἐν ἀγάπη, \"to speak the truth in love\" (Ephesians 4:15). There seems little ground for the remark of Salasius, that \"mercy\" refers to our neighbours, and \"truth\" to God. Each virtue, in fact, has a twofold reference - one to God, the other to man. The promise in ver. 4, that the exercise of these virtues procures favour with God and man, implies this twofold aspect. Bind them about thy neck; eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as ornaments worn about the neck (Gejerus, Zockler); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) as amulets or talismans, which were worn from a superstitious notion to ward off danger (Umbreit and Vaihinger); orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) as treasures which one wears attached to the neck by a chain to guard against their loss (Hitzig); orNEWLINENEWLINE(4) as a signet, which was carried on a string round the neck (Delitzsch). The true reference of the passage seems to lie between (1) and (3). The latter adapts itself to the parallel expression, \"Write them on the tablet of thine heart,\" and also agrees with Proverbs 6:21, \"Tie them about thy neck,\" the idea being that of their careful preservation against loss. The former meaning, however, seems preferable. Mercy and truth are to be ornaments of the character, to be bound round the neck, i.e. worn at all times (comp. Proverbs 1:9, \"For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thine head, and chains about thy neck.\" See also Genesis 41:42; Song of Solomon 1:10; Song of Solomon 4:9; Ezekiel 16:11). The imagery of the binding is evidently taken from Exodus 13:9 and Deuteronomy 6:8, and is suggestive of the tephillim, or phylacteries. Write them upon the table of thine heart; i.e. inscribe them. mercy and truth, deeply there, impress them thoroughly and indelibly upon thine heart, so that they may never be forgotten, and may form the mainspring of your actions. The expression implies that the heart is to be in entire union with their dictates. The table (luakh) was the tablet expressly prepared for writing by being polished, corresponding to the πινακίδον, the writing table of Luke 1:63, which, however, was probably covered with wax. The inscription was made with the stylus. The same word is used of the tables of stone, on which the ten commandments were written with the finger of God, end allusion is in all probability here made to that fact (Exodus 31:18; Exodus 34:28). The expression, \"the tables of the heart,\" occurs in Proverbs 7:3; Jeremiah 17:1 (cf. 2 Corinthians 3:3); and is used by AEschylus, 'Pro.,' 789, δέλτοι φρενῶν, \"the tablets of the heart.\" This clause is omitted in the LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - So shalt thou find (vum'lsa); literally, and find. A peculiar use of the imperative, the imperative kal (m'tsa) with vau consecutive (וִ) being equivalent to the future, \"thou shalt find,\" as in the Authorized Version. This construction, where two imperatives are joined, the former containing an exhortation or admonition, the second a promise made on the condition implied in the first, and the second imperative being used as a future, occurs again in Proverbs 4:4; Proverbs 7:2, \"Keep my commandments, and live;\" 9:6, \"Forsake the foolish, and live;\" 20:13, \"Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread\" (cf. Genesis 42:18; Psalm 37:27; Job 22:21; Isaiah 36:16; Hosea 10:12; Amos 5:4-6; Gesenius, § 130, 2). Delitzsch calls this \"an admonitory imperative;\" Bottcher, \"the desponsive imperative.\" Compare the Greek construction in Menander, Οϊδ ὅτι ποίησον, for ποιήσεις, \"Know that this you will do.\" Find (matza); here simply \"to attain,\" \"obtain,\" not necessarily implying previous search, as in Proverbs 17:20. Favour (khen). The same word is frequently translated \"grace,\" and means the same thing; Vulgate, gratia; LXX., χαρίς. For the expression, \"to find favour\" (matsa khen), see Genesis 6:8; Exodus 33:12; Jeremiah 31:2; comp. Luke 1:30, Αῦρες γὰρ χάριν παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ.\" For thou hast found favour [or, 'grace'] with God.\" spoken by Gabriel to the Virgin. Good understanding (sekel tov); i.e. good sagacity, or prudence. So Delitzsch, Bertheau, Kamph. A true sagacity, prudence, or penetrating judgment will be adjudicated by God and man to him who possesses the internal excellence of love and truth. The Hebrew sekel is derived from sakal, \"to act wisely or prudently,\" and has this intellectual meaning in Proverbs 13:15; Psalm 111:10 (see also 1 Samuel 25:3 and 2 Chronicles 30:22). The Targum Jonathan reads, intellectus et benignitas, thus throwing the adjective into a substantival form; the Syriac, intellectus simply. Ewald, Hitzig, Zockler, and others, on the other hand, understand sekel as referring to the judgment formed of any one, the favourable opinion or view which is entertained of hint by others, and hence take it as reputation, or estimation. The man who has love and truth will be held in high esteem by God and man. Our objection to this rendering is that it does not seem to advance the meaning of the passage beyond that of \"favour.\" Another, mentioned by Delitzsch, is that sekel is never used in any other sense than that of intellectus in the Mishle. The marginal reading, \"good success,\" i.e. prosperity, seems inadmissible here, as the hiph. has'kil, \"to cause to prosper,\" as in Proverbs 17:8; Joshua 1:7; Deuteronomy 29:9, does not apply in this instance any more than in Psalm 111:10, margin. In the sight of God and man (b'eyney elohim v'adam); literally, in the eyes of Elohim and man; i.e. according to the judgment of God and man (Zockler); Vulgate, coram Deo et hominibus. A simpler form of this phrase is found in 1 Samuel 2:26, where Samuel is said to have found favour with the Lord, and also with men. So in Luke 2:52 Jesus found favour \"with God and man (παρὰ Θεῷ καὶ ἀνθρώποις)\" (comp. Genesis 10:9; Acts 2:47, Romans 14:18). The two conditions of favor and sagacity, or prudence, are not to be assigned respectively to God and man (as Ewald and Hitzig), or that finding favour has reference more to God, and being deemed prudent refers more to man. The statement is universal. Both these conditions will be adjudged to the man who has mercy and truth by God in heaven and man on earth at the same time (see Delitszch). The LXX., \"after favour,\" instead of the text, reads, \"and provide good things in the sight of the Lord and men,\" quoted by St. Paul (2 Corinthians 8:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Trust in the Lord (b'takh el y'hovah); literally, trust in Jehovah. Entire reliance upon Jehovah, implied in the words, \"with all thine heart,\" is here appropriately placed at the head of a series of admonitions which especially have God and man's relations with him in view, inasmuch as such confidence or trust, with its corresponding idea of the renunciation of reliance on self, is, as Zockler truly remarks, a \"fundamental principle of all religion.\" It is the first lesson to be learnt by all, and no less necessary for the Jew than for the Christian. Without this reliance on or confidence in God, it is impossible to carry out any of the precepts of religion. Batakh is, properly, \"to cling to,\" and so passes to the meaning of \"to confide in,\" \"to set one's hope and confidence upon.\" The preposition el with Jehovah indicates the direction which the confidence is to take (cf. Psalm 37:3, 5). Lean (tishshaen); Vulgate, innitaris; followed by el, like b'takh, with which it is very similar in meaning. Shaan, not used in kal, in hiph. signifies \"to lean upon, rest upon,\" just as man rests upon a spear for support. Its metaphorical use, to repose confidence in, is derived from the practice of kings who were accustomed to appear in public leaning on their friends and ministers; cf. 2 Kings 5:18; 2 Kings 7:2, 17 (Gesenius). The admonition does not mean that we are not to use our own understanding (binab), i.e. form plans with discretion, and employ legitimate means in the pursuit of our ends; but that, when we use it, we are to depend upon God and his directing and overruling providence (Wardlaw); cf. Jeremiah 9:23, 24. \"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\" etc. The teacher points out not only where we are to rely, but also where we are not to rely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In all thy ways. This expression covers the whole area of life's action - all its acts and undertakings, its spiritual and secular sides, no less than its public and private, It guards against our acknowledging God in great crises and solemn acts of worship only (Plumptre). Acknowledge (daehu); Vulgate, cogita; LXX., γνέριζε. The Hebrew verb yada signifies \"to know, recognize.\" To acknowledge God is, therefore, to recognize, in all our dealings and undertakings, God's overruling providence, which \"shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will.\" It is not a mere theoretical acknowledgment, but one that engages the whole energies of the soul (Delitzsch), and sees in God power, wisdom, providence, goodness, and justice. This meaning is conveyed by the Vulgate cogitare, which is \"to consider\" in all parts, \"to reflect upon.\" David's advice to his son Solomon is, \"Know thou (ola) the God of thy father.\" We may well acknowledge Jehovah; for he \"knoweth the way of the righteous\" (Psalm 1:6). Acknowledging God also implies that we first ascertain whether what we are about to take in hand is in accordance with his precepts, and then look for his direction and illumination (Wardlaw). And he shall direct thy paths (v'hu y'yashsher or'khotheyka); i.e. he himself shall make them straight, or level, removing all obstacles out of the way; or they shall, under God's direction, prosper and come to a successful issue; they shall be virtuous, inasmuch as deviation into vice will be guarded against, and happy, because they are prosperous. The pronoun v'hu is emphatic, \"he himself;\" Vulgate, et ipse. Yashar, piel. is \"to make a way straight,\" as in Proverbs 9:15; Proverbs 15:21; Proverbs 11:5. Cf. the LXX. ὀρθοτομεῖν, \"to cut straight\" (see on Proverbs 11:5). God here binds himself by a covenant (Lapide). This power is properly attributed to God, for \"it is not in man to direct his steps\" (Jeremiah 10:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Be not wise in thine own eyes. This admonition carries on the thought from the preceding verses (5, 6), approaching it from a different direction. It is a protest against self-sufficiency, self-conceit, and self-reliance. It says, in effect, \"Trust in the Lord, do not trust in yourself.\" Wisdom, as Michaelis remarks, is to trust in God; to trust in yourself and in your own wisdom is unwisdom. God denounces this spirit: \"Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!\" (Isaiah 5:21), because such a spirit leads to the prohibited self-dependence, and is inconsistent with \"the tear of the Lord.\" The precept of the text is reiterated by St. Paul, especially in Romans 12:16, \"Be not wise in your own conceits\" (cf. 1 Corinthians 8:8; Galatians 6:3). It commends humility. The diligent search for Wisdom is commanded. The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have already attained it (Plumptre). In thine own eyes; i.e. in thine own estimation; arbitrio tuo (Trem. et Jun.). Fear the Lord, and depart from evil. The connection of this with the first part of the verse becomes clear upon reflection. \"The fear of the Lord\" is true wisdom (Job 28:28; Proverbs 1:7). Fear the Lord, therefore, because it is the best corrective of one's own wisdom, which engenders arrogance, pride, presumption of mind, which, moreover, is deceptive and apt to lead to sin. The fear of the Lord has this other advantage - that it leads to the departure from evil (Proverbs 16:6) It is the mark of the wise man that he fears the Lord, and departs from evil (Proverbs 14:16). These precepts form the two elements of practical piety (Delitzsch), an eminent example of which as Job (Job 1:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. A metaphorical expression, denoting the complete spiritual health which shall follow from fearing the Lord and departing from evil. Health, (riph'uth); properly, healing; LXX., ιἅσις; Vulgate, sanitas; so Syriac and Arabic. The Targum Jonathan has medicina, \"medicine,\" as the margin. The root rapha is properly \"to sew together,\" and the secondary meaning, \"to heal,\" is taken from the healing of a wound by sewing it up. Delitzsch, however, thinks riph'uth is not to be taken as a restoration from sickness, but as a raising up from enfeebled health, or a confirming of the strength which already exists. There shall be a continuance of health. Gesenius translates \"refreshment.\" To thy navel (l'shor'rekha); Vulgate, umbilico tuo; so Targum Jonathan. Shor is \"the navel,\" here used synecdochically for the whole body, just as \"head\" is put for the whole man (Judges 5:30), \"mouth\" for the whole person speaking (Proverbs 8:13), and \"slow bellies\" for depraved gluttons (Titus 1:12) (Gejerus, Umbreit). The idea is expressed in the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic by \"to thy body\" (τῷ σώματι σου; corpori tuo). The navel is here regarded as the centre of vital strength. For the word, see Song of Solomon 7:2; Ezekiel 16:4. This is the only place in the Proverbs where this word is found. Gesenius, however, takes shor, or l'shor'rekha, as standing col. lectively for the nerves, in which, he says, is the seat of strength, and translates accordingly, \"Health (i.e. refreshment) shall it be to thy nerves.\" Marrow (shik'kuy); literally, watering or moistening, as in the margin; Vulgate, irrigatio. Moistening is imparted to the bones by the marrow, and thus they are strengthened: \"His bones are moistened with marrow\" (Job 21:24). Where there is an absence of marrow the drying up of the bones ensues, and hence their strength is impaired, and a general debility of the system sets in - they \"wax old\" (Psalm 32:3). The effect of a broken spirit is thus described: \"A broken spirit drieth up the bones\" (Proverbs 17:22). The physiological fact here brought forward is borne witness to by Cicero, 'In Tusc.:' \"In visceribus atque medullis omne bonum condidisse naturam\" (cf. Plato). The meaning of the passage is that, as health to the navel and marrow to the bones stand as representatives of physical strength, so the fear of the Lord, etc., is the spiritual strength of God's children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHonour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Honour the Lord with thy substance, etc. An exhortation to self-sacrificing devotion by the appropriation and use of wealth to the service of Jehovah. With thy substance (mehonehka); Vulgate, de tua substantia; LXX., ἀπὸ σῶν δικαίων πόνων. Hon, properly \"lightness,\" is \"opulence,\" \"wealth,\" as in Proverbs 1:13. The min in composition with hon is not partitive, as Delitzsch and Berthean take it, but signifies \"with\" or \"by means of,\" as in Psalm 38:7; Isaiah 58:12; Ezekiel 28:18; Obadiah 1:9. The insertion of δικαίος by the LXX. limits the wealth to that which is justly acquired, and so guards against the erroneous idea that God is honoured by the appropriation to his use of unlawful wealth or gain (Plumptre). The Israelites \"honoured Jehovah with their substance\" when they contributed towards the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and later when they assisted in the preparations for the building of the temple, and in the payment of tithes. The injunction may undoubtedly refer to tithes, and is in accordance with the requirement of the Mosaic Law on that and other points as to oblations, free will offerings, etc.; but it has a wider bearing and contemplates the use of wealth for all pious and charitable purposes (see Proverbs 14:31). The word maaser, \"tithe,\" does not occur in the Proverbs. With the firstfruits (mere-shith); Vulgate, de primitiis. So Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic. The law of the firstfruits is found in Exodus 22:29; Exodus 23:19; Exodus 34:20; Leviticus 23:10; Numbers 18:12: Deuteronomy 18:4; Deuteronomy 26:1-3. The firstfruits were presented by every Israelite to the priests, in token of gratitude and humble thankfulness to Jehovah, and consisted of the produce of the land in its natural state, or prepared for human food (Maclear, 'Old Test. Hist.,' bk. 4, c. 3, a). The \"firstfruits\" also carried with it the idea of the best. The custom of offering the firstfruits of the field and other revenues as a religious obligation was observed by ancient pagan nations (see Diod. Sic., 1:14; Plut., 'De Iside,' p. 377; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 18:2 (Zockler). Some of the ancient commentators find in this verse an argument for the support of the ministry. It is well known that the priests \"lived of the sacrifice,\" and were \"partakers of the altar,\" and as their support by these means tended to the maintenance of Divine worship, so those who supported them were in the highest degree \"honoring God.\" The injunctions also show that the honouring of God does not consist simply of lip service, of humility and confidence in him, but also of external worship, and in corporeal things. They are not peculiar to Israel, but are binding on all. They oppose all selfish use of God's temporal gifts, and lead to the thought that, in obeying them, we are only giving back to God what are his own. \"The silver and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts\" (Haggai 2:28).NEWLINENEWLINE\"We give thee but thine own,NEWLINEWhate'er the gift may be;NEWLINEAll that we have is thine shine,NEWLINEA trust, O Lord, from thee.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Day's 'Psalter.')NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - So shall thy barns be filled with plenty. The promise held out to encourage the devotion of one's wealth to Jehovah's service, while supplying a motive which at first sight appears selfish and questionable, is in reality a trial of faith. Few persons find it easy to realize that giving away will increase their store (Wardlaw). The teacher is warranted in bringing forward this promise by the language of Moses in Deuteronomy 28:1-8, whine, among other things, he promises that Jehovah will command a blessing upon the \"storehouses\" and industry of those who honour God. The principle is otherwise expressed in Proverbs 11:25, \"The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be also watered himself;\" and it is exemplified in Haggai 1:3-11; Haggai 2:15, 19; Malachi 3:10-12, and in the New Testament in Philippians 4:14-19; 2 Corinthians 9:6-8. Thy barns; asameykha, the only form in which asam, \"a storehouse,\" \"barn,\" or \"granary,\" occurs. The Hebrew asam is the same as the Latin horreum (Vulgate) and the Greek ταμιεῖον (LXX.). With plenty (sava); Vulgate, saturitas; i.e. fulness, abundance, plenty. The root sava is \"to become satisfied,\" and that richly satisfied. This expression and the following, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine, depict the greatest abundance. Thy presses (y'kaveykhu). The word here translated \"presses\" is, strictly speaking,\" vats\" or \"reservoirs,\" into which the must from the wine press flowed. The wine press consisted of two parts, the gath (equivalent to the Latin torcularium, torculum, or torcular; Greek, ληνός, Matthew 21:33), into which the grapes were collected from the surrounding vineyard, and there trodden underfoot by several persons (Nehemiah 13:15: Isaiah 63:3; Lamentations 1:15), whose movements were regulated by singing or shouting (Isaiah 16:10; Jeremiah 48:33), as among the Greeks (see 'Athen.,' 5. p. 199, a; Anacreon, 'Od.,' 17:1, 52; cf. Theocritus, 7:25) and Egyptians (Wilkinson, 'Man. and Cust.,' vol. 2. pp. 152-157); and the yekev, used here, which was a trough of corresponding size, dug into the ground, or cut out of a rack, at a lower level, to receive the must. The yekev corresponded with the Greek ὑπολήνιον, mentioned in Mark 12:l, and the Latin lacus (Ovid, 'Fasti,' 5:888; Pliny, 'Epist.,' 9:20; 'Colum. de Rust.,' 12:18): Cajeterus, indeed, reads, lacus torcularii. The word yekev is, however, used for the wine press itself in Job 24:11 and 2 Kings 6:27. Shall burst out (yiph'rotsu); literally, they shall extend themselves; i.e. shall overflow. Parats, \"to break,\" is here used metaphorically in the sense of \"to be redundant,\" \"to overflow\" (cf. 2 Samuel 5:20). It is employed intransitively of a people spreading themselves abroad, or increasing, in Genesis 28:14; Exodus 1:12. New wine (tirosh); Vulgate, Arabic, and Syriac, vino; LXX., οἴνῳ; properly, as in the Authorized Version, \"new wine;\" Latin, mustum (see Deuteronomy 33:28; Isaiah 36:17; Isaiah 55:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord. The teacher, in vers. 11 and 12, passes to another phase of life. The thought of prosperity suggests the opposite one of adversity. Abundant prosperity shall flow from honouring Jehovah, but he sometimes and not unfrequently sends affliction, and, indeed, without this life would be incomplete. The object of the exhortation is, as Delitzsch states, to show that, as in prosperity God should not be forgotten, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged by days of adversity. Submission is counselled on the ground that, when Jehovah afflicts, he does so in the spirit of love, and for good. The \"chastening\" and \"correction,\" though presenting God in an attitude of anger, are in reality not the punishment of an irate God. The verse before us is evidently copied from Job 5:17, \"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth, therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty;\" and the whole passage is cited again in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 12:5, 6). It has been said that ver. 11 expresses the problem of the Book of Job, and ver. 12 its solution (Delitzsch). Despise not (al-timas); Vulgate, ne abjicias; LXX., μὴ ὀλιγώρει. The verb mass is first \"to reject,\" and then \"to despise and contemn.\" The Targum Jonathan puts the thought in a stronger form, ne execreris, \"do not curse.\" They despise the chastening of Jehovah who, when they see his hand in it, do not humbly and submissively bow, but resist and become refractory, or, as it is expressed in Proverbs 19:3, when their \"heart fretteth against the Lord.\" Job, notwithstanding his bitter complaints, was on the whole, and in his better moments, an example of the proper state of mind under correction (see Job 1:21; Job 2:10). Jonah, in treating contemptuously the procedure of God, is an exemplification of the contrary spirit, which is condemned implicitly in the text (Wardlaw). Chastening (musar); i.e. correction not by reproof only, as in Proverbs 6:23 and Proverbs 8:30; but by punishment also. as in Proverbs 13:24; Proverbs 22:15. The meaning here is expressed by the LXX. παιδεία, which is \"instruction by punishment,\" discipline, or schooling (cf. Vulgate, disciplina). Neither be weary (al-takots); i.e. do not loathe, abhor, feel disgust nor vexation towards. The expression, \"do not loathe,\" is a climax to the other, \"despise not.\" It represents a more deeply seated aversion to Jehovah's plans. Gesenius takes the primary meaning of kuts to be that of vomiting. The word before us certainly denotes loathing or nausea, and is used in this sense by the Israelites in their complaints against God and against Moses in Numbers 21:5 (cf. Genesis 27:46). The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in quoting the passage, adopts the LXX. reading, μὴ ὀκλύου, \"nor faint;\" Vulgate, ne deficias, i.e. \"do not give way to despondency.\" Correction. This word, like musar above, has a twofold meaning of either punishment or chastening, as in Psalm 73:14; or reproof, as in Proverbs 1:23; 25:30; 5:12; 27:5; 29:15, where it also occurs. It is here used in the former sense. To loathe the correction of Jehovah is to allow it to completely estrange us from him. We faint under it when, by dwelling on or brooding over, or bemoaning the trial, the spirit sinks to faintness. To faint at correction ignores the belief in the truth that \"all things work together for good to them that love God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - In this verse the motive for submissiveness to Jehovah's corrections is brought forward. They are corrections, but they are the corrections of love. One of the most touching relationships of life, and that with which we are most familiar, viz. that of father and son, is employed to reconcile us to Jehovah's afflictive dispensations. A comparison is drawn. God corrects those whom he loves after the same manner as a father corrects (\"correcteth\" has to be understood from the first hemistich) the son whom he loves. The idea of the passage is evidently taken from Deuteronomy 8:5, \"Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.\" The idea of the paternal relationship of God to mankind is found elsewhere (Jeremiah 31:9; Malachi 2:10), and especially finds expression in the Lord's prayer. When the truth of this passage is learned, we shall be drawn to, rather than repelled from, God by his corrections. The gracious end of earthly trials is expressed in Hebrews 12:6, 2; cf. Romans 5:3-5; 2 Corinthians 4:17 (Wardlaw). \"These gracious words (Hebrews 12.) are written in Holy Scripture for our comfort and instruction; that we should patiently and with thanksgiving bear our heavenly Father's correction, whensoever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us\" (see Visitation Office). Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth (vuk'av eth-ben yir'tseh); literally, even as a father the son be delighteth in. Various renderings have been given to this passage.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Delitzsch, De Wette, et al., agree with the Authorized Version, and take ו vav, as explicative, and yir'tseh, \"in whom he delighteth,\" as a relative sentence. The ו is used in this explanatory sense in 1 Samuel 28:3 (see Gesenius, § 155, 1 a). The relative usher, \"whom,\" is omitted in the original, according to the rule that the relative is omitted, especially in poetry, where it would stand as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative case (comp. Psalm 7:16, \"And he falls into the pit (which) he made;\" and Proverbs 5:13). We have the same elision of the relative in the English colloquial expression, \"the friend I met\" (see Gesenius, § 123:3, a).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Hitzig and Zockler translate, \"and holds him dear as a father his son.\" This, though grammatically correct, does not preserve the parallelism. It serves only to expand the idea of love, whereas the predominant idea of the verse is that of correction, to which love is an accessory idea (see Delitzsch). For similar parallels, see Deuteronomy 8:5 as before, and Psalm 103:13. In the comparison which is instituted, yir'tseh, \"in whom he delighteth,\" corresponds with eth asher ye'hav y'hovah, \"whom the Lord loveth,\" and not with yokiah, \"correcteth.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Kamph translates, \"and (dealeth) as a father (who) wisheth well to his son.\" This is substantially the same as the Authorized Version, except that in the relative sentence \"son\" is made accusative after yir'tseh, here translated, \"wisheth well to,\" and the emitted relative (asher) is placed in the nominative instead of the accusative case.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The variation in the LXX., μαστιγοῖ δὲ πάντα ὑίον ο{ν παραδέχεται, \"and scourgeth every son whom he rcceiveth,\" cited literally in Hebrews 12:5, evidently arises from the translators having read יַכְאֵב, (yakev), \"he scourgeth\" for וּכֵאָב (vuk'av), \"even as a father.\" It will be seen that this alteration could be easily effected by a change in the Masoretic pointing.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The Vulgate renders, et quasi pater in filio complacet sibi. He delighteth; yir'tseh is from ratsah, \"to be delighted\" with any person or thing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHappy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-18. - The teacher here enters upon the last part of this discourse. In doing so, he reverts to his main subject, which is Wisdom, or the fear of the Lord (see ver. 7 and Proverbs 1:7), and pronounces a panegyric upon her, comparing her, as in Job 28, with treasures whose value she exceeds, and showing wherein that value consists, viz. in the gifts which she confers on man. Verse 13. - Happy is the man (ash'rey adam); literally, blessings of the man. The plural of \"excellence\" used here, as in Job 5:17, to raise the sense. The man who has found Wisdom is supremely blessed. Beds connects this blessedness immediately with God's chastisements in the preceding verse. So Delitzsch. That findeth (matsa); properly, hath found. \"The perfect expresses permanent possession, just as the imperfect, yaphik, denotes a continually renewed and repeated attaining\" (Zockler). The Vulgate also uses the perfect, invenit, \"hath found;\" LXX., ο{ς εϋρε, \"who found\" - the aorist. The man that getteth understanding (adam yaphik t'vunah); literally, the man that draweth out understanding, as in the margin. Yaphik is the hiph. future or imperfect of puk, the primary meaning of which is educere, \"to draw out,\" \"to bring forth.\" This verb is used in two widely different senses. In the first place, it is equivalent to \"bring forth\" or \"draw out\" in the sense of imparting, as in Isaiah 58:10, \"If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\" i.e. impart benefits to them; and Psalm 145:13, \"That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store,\" i.e. yielding, giving out, presenting for our benefit. Its second sense is that of attaining, drawing out from another for one's own use. In this sense it occurs in Proverbs 8:35; Proverbs 12:2; Proverbs 18:22, where it is rendered \"obtain.\" The latter sense is the one that suits the present passage, and best agrees with the corresponding matsa. The man is blessed who draws forth, i.e. obtains, understanding from God for himself. The Vulgate renders, qui affluit prudentia, \"who overflows with understanding,\" or, has understanding in abundance; LXX., ο{ς εῖδε, equivalent to \"who saw.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The merchandise (sakh'rah); Vulgate, acquisitio; LXX., ἐμπορεύεσθαι. The gain arising from trading in wisdom is better than that which arises from trading in silver. Sakh'rah is the gain or profit arising from merchandise, i.e. from trading. It denotes the act itself of gaining. The root sakrah, like the Greek ἐμπορευέσθαι, signifies \"to go about for the sake of traffic,\" i.e. to trade. There may be an allusion here, as in Proverbs 2:4, to the new commerce (Plumptre). The gain thereof (t'vuathah); i.e. the gain existing in, and going along with, Wisdom herself; gain, therefore, in a different sense from that indicated in sakh'rah. Gesenius takes it as \"gain resulting from Wisdom,\" as in Proverbs 8:19 and Isaiah 23:3. The word is used of the produce of the earth, the idea apparently embodied in the Vulgate fructus. In this case there may be a reference to ver. 18, where Wisdom is said to be a \"tree of life.\" The LXX. omits the latter clause of this verse. The sense is, \"The possession of Wisdom herself is better than fine gold.\" Fine gold (karuts); Vulgate, aurum purum; Syriac, aurum purissimum. Kharuts is the poetic word for gold, so called, eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) from its brilliancy, and then akin to the Greek χρυσός (Curtius); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) from its being dug up, from the root kharats, \"to cut into or dig up, to sharpen.\" It evidently means the finest and purest gold, and is here contrasted with silver (keseph). The word is translated \"choice gold\" in Proverbs 8:10; \"gold\" simply in Proverbs 16:16; \"yellow gold\" in Psalm 68:13; and \"fine gold\" in Zechariah 9:3. In the Version Junii et Tremellii it appears as effosum aurum, \"gold dug up,\" i.e. gold in its native, unalloyed state. The Targum Jonathan understands it of \"molten gold\" (aurum conflatum).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Rubies (Khetib, p'niyim; Keri, p'ninim). No unanimous opinion has been arrived at as to the real signification of the word here translated \"rubies.\" The majority of the rabbins (among them Rashi), and Bochart, Hartman, Bohlen, Lee on Job 38:18, and Zockler, render it \"pearls.\" Its meaning seems to lie between this and \"corals,\" the rendering adopted by Michaelis, Gesenius, and Delitzsch (following Fleischer), who says that the Hebrew p'ninim corresponds with the Arabia word whose root idea is \"shooting forth,\" and means \"a branch.\" The peculiar branching form in which corm is found favours this opinion, which is strengthened by the passage in Lamentations 4:7, where we get additional information as to color, \"They [the Nazarites] were more ruddy in body than rubies,\" a description of which would apply to \"coral,\" but is scarcely applicable to \"pearls.\" The various versions suggest the further idea that p'ninim was a descriptive word used to denote precious stones in general. The LXX. renders, \"She is more precious than precious stones (λίθων πολυτελῶν).\" So the Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic. The Vulgate renders. \"She is more precious than all riches (cunctis opibus).\" The word p'ninim only occurs here (Keri) and in Proverbs 8:11; Proverbs 20:15; Proverbs 31:10; and in Job and Lamentations as above. This passage, as well as Proverbs 8:11, which is an almost literal repetition of it, are imitations of Job 28:18. The identification of p'ninim with \"pearls\" may have suggested our Lord's parable of the pearl of great price (Matthew 13:45, 46). All the things thou canst desire (kal-khaphatseyka); literally, all thy desires. Here everything in which you have pleasure, or all your precious things; LXX., πᾶν τίμον; Vulgate, omnia, quae desiderantur. The comparison, which has risen from the less to the more valuable, culminates in this comprehensive expression. There is nothing, neither silver, gold, precious stones, nor anything precious, which is an equivalent (shavah) to Wisdom in value. How it shows, when everything is put before us to choose from, that, like Solomon at Gibeon, we should prefer wisdom (1 Kings 3:11-13)! In the second half of this verse the LXX. substitutes, \"No evil thing competes with her; she is well known to all that approach her.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLength of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The remaining three verses (16-18) state in what respects Wisdom is incomparable in value. Length of days; orek yamim, as in ver. 2. Wisdom is here represented as holding in her right hand that which is previously promised to obedience. Length of days is the blessing of blessings, the condition of all prosperity and enjoyment, and hence is placed in the right hand, the chief place, for among the Hebrews and other Oriental nations, as also among the Greeks the right hand was regarded as the position of highest honour (Psalm 110:1; 1 Kings 2:19; 1 Macc. 10:63; Matthew 22:24); cf. Psalm 16:11. in which the psalmist says of Jehovah, \"In thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore.\" The two hands, the right and the left, signify the abundance of Wisdom's gifts. Riches and honour stand here for prosperity in general. The same expression occurs in Proverbs 8:8, where riches are explained as \"durable riches.\" A spiritual interpretation can, of course, be given to this passage - length of days being understood of eternal life; riches, of heavenly riches; and honour, not \"the honour that cometh of men,\" but honour conferred by God (1 Samuel 5:44; John 12:26); see Wardlaw, in loc. The thought of the verse is, of course, that Wisdom not only holds these blessings in her hands, but also confers them on those who seek her. The LXX. adds, \"Out of her month proceedeth righteousness; justice and mercy she beareth upon her tongue;\" possibly suggested by Proverbs 8:3. The words of the teacher remind us of the saying of Menander, Ὁ διαφέρων λογισμῷ πάντ ἔχει, \"He who excels in prudence possesses all things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Ways of pleasantness (dar'key noam); Vulgate, viae pulchrae; LXX., ὁδοὶ καλαὶ. Wisdom's ways are those in which substantial delight may be found. They are beautiful and lovely to look upon, and afford happiness. All her paths are peace (v'kal-n'thivo-theyah shalom); literally, as in the Authorized Version. \"Peace,\" shalom, is not genitive as \"pleasantness.\" The character of peace is stamped upon her paths, so that in speaking of Wisdom's paths we speak of peace. She brings tranquillity and serenity and blessedness. Her paths are free from strife and alarm, and they lead to peace. (On the distinction between \"ways\" and \"paths\" - the more open and the more private walks - see Proverbs 2:15.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A tree of life (ets-khayyim); Vulgate, lignum vitae; LXX., ξύλον ζωῆς. This expression obviously refers to \"the tree of life\" (ets-hakayyim), which was placed in the midst of the garden of Eden, and conferred immortality on those who ate of its fruit (Genisis 2:9; 3:22). So Wisdom becomes equally life giving to those who lay hold on her, who taste of her fruit. She communicates life in its manifold fulness and richness (so the plural \"lives\" indicates) to those who seize her firmly. What is predicated of Wisdom here is predicated in other passages (Proverbs 11:30; Proverbs 13:12; Proverbs 15:4) of the fruit of the righteous, the fulfilment of desire, and a wholesome tongue. Each of these, the teacher says, is \"a tree of life.\" Elster denies that there is any reference to \"the tree of life,\" and classes the expression among those other figurative expressions - a \"fountain of life,\" in Proverbs 13:4 and Proverbs 14:27, and a \"well of life.\" in Proverbs 10:11; but if it be once admitted that there is such a reference, and it be remembered also that Wisdom is the same as \"the fear of the Lord,\" the point insisted on in the Proverbs and in Job, it seems difficult to deny that the teacher has in view the blessed immortality of which the tree of life in Paradise as the symbol. In this higher sense the term is used in the Revelation (Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:2, 14). Wisdom restores to her worshippers the life which was lost in Adam (Cartwright). It is remarkable that the imagery here employed is confined to these two hooks. After the historical record in Genesis, no other sacred writers refer to the tree of life. Old ecclesiastical writers saw in the expression a reference to Christ's redeeming work. \"The tree of life is the cross of Christ,\" lignum vitae crux Christi (quoted by Delitzsch). The symbol, Plumptre remarks, entered largely into the religious imagery of Assyria, Egypt, and Persia. To them that lay hold upon (lam-makhazikim, hiph. participle); Vulgate, his, qui apprehenderint; LXX., τοῖς ἀντεχομένοις. The Hebrew verb חָזַק (khazak), \"to tie fast,\" is in hiph. with בְּ (b),\" to take hold of,\" \"to seize any one.\" Happy is every one that retaineth her. In the original, the participle, \"they retaining her\" (tom'keyah), is plural, and the predicate, \"happy\" or \"blessed\" (m'ushshar), is singular. The latter is used distributively, and the construction is common (cf. Proverbs 15:22). The Authorized Version aptly renders the original. The necessity for \"retaining\" as well as \"laying hold\" of Wisdom is pointed out. The verb תָּמַך (tamak) is \"to hold fast something taken.\" Such will be blessed who hold Wisdom tenaciously and perseveringly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-26. - 5. Fifth hortatory discourse. Wisdom, the creative power of God, exhibited as the protection of those who fear God. The teacher in this discourse presents Wisdom under a new aspect. Wisdom is the Divine power of God, by which he created the world, and by which he sustains the work of his hands and regulates the operations of nature. This eminence of Wisdom, in her intimate association with Jehovah, is made the basis of a renewed exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily in view. The elevated thought that Wisdom has her source in Jehovah might seem in itself an adequate and sufficient reason for the exhortation. But another motive is adduced intimately bound up with this view of Wisdom. Jehovah becomes the ground of confidence and the protection in all conditions of life of those who keep Wisdom. Verse 19. - The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth. The emphatic position of the word Jehovah, \"the Lord,\" at the beginning of the sentence (cf. Psalm 27; Psalm 97; Psalm 99), as well as the nature of the discourse, indicates a new paragraph. The description of the creative Wisdom of Jehovah may have been suggested to the mind of the teacher by the mention of the tree of life, in ver. 18 (Zockler); but the connection between this and the preceding passage has to be sought for in something deeper. The scope of the teacher is to exhibit, and so to recommend, Wisdom in every respect, and after showing her excellence in man, he now brings her forward as the medium of creation, and hence in her relation to God. By wisdom (b'kokhmah); Vulgate, sapientia; LXX., σοφίᾳ. It is evident that Wisdom is here something more than an attribute of Jehovah. \"By Wisdom\" means \"by, or through, the instrumentality of Wisdom.\" While the corresponding and parallel expressions, \"understanding,\" \"knowledge,\" militate against the idea of an hypostatizing of Wisdom, i.e. assigning to Wisdom a concrete and objective personality, yet the language is sufficiently strong, when we connect this passage with ch. 1. and 8, to warrant our regarding Wisdom as something apart from yet intimately connected with Jehovah, as an active agency employed by him, and hence this description may. be looked upon as an anticipation of that which is more fully developed in ch. 8, where the characteristics which are wanting here are there worked out at length. The rabbins evidently connected the passage before us, as well as ch. 1 and 8, with Genesis 1:1, by rendering b'reshith, \"in the beginning.\" by b'kokhmah, \"by Wisdom.\" Our Lord identifies himself with the Divine Sophia, or Wisdom (Luke 11:49). And the language of St. John, \"All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made\" (John 1:3), which assigns to the Logos, or Word of God, i.e. Christ, the act of creation (cf. John 1:10, and especially the language of St. Paul, in Colossians 1:16), argues in favour of the view of some commentators who understand Wisdom to refer to the Second Person of the Trinity. The Logos was understood by Alexandrian Judaism to express the manifestation of the unseen God, the Absolute Being, in the creation and government of the world; and the Christian teachers, when they adopted this term, assigned to it a concrete meaning as indicating the Incarnate Word (see Bishop Lightfoot, in Colossians 1:15). For the passage, see Psalm 33:6; Psalm 104:24; Psalm 136:5; and especially Jeremiah 10:12, \"He hath established the world by his wisdom,\" etc.; Jeremiah 51:55; Ecclus. 24:2, seq. Hath founded (yasod); Vulgate, fundavit; LXX., ἐθεμελίωσε. The same verb is used in Job 38:4; Psalm 24:2; Psalm 78:69, of the creation of the earth by God. While the primary meaning of yasad is \"to give fixity to,\" \"to lay fast,\" that of konen, rendered \"he hath established,\" is \"to set up,\" \"to erect,\" and so \"to found,\" from kun, or referring to the Arabic and Ethiopic cognate root, \"to exist,\" \"to give existence to.\" The marginal reading, \"prepared,\" corresponds with the LXX. ἐτοίμασε. The Vulgate is stabilivit, \"he hath established.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - By his knowledge the depths are broken up. This is usually taken to refer to that primary act in creation, the separation of the waters from the earth, when \"the waters were gathered together unto their own place,\" as recorded in Genesis 1:9. So Munster, Zockler, Wardlaw. But it seems better to understand it (as Mercerus, Lapide, Delitzsch, and Authorized Version) of the fertilization of the earth by rivers, streams, etc., which burst forth from the interior of the earth. In this sense the correspondence is preserved with the second hemistich. where the atmospheric influence is referred to as conducing to the same end. The teacher passes from the creation to the wonderful means which Jehovah employs through Wisdom to sustain his work. The depths (t'homoth); Vulgate, abyssi; LXX., ἄβυσσοι, are here \"the internal water stores of the earth\" (Delitzsch), and not the depths of the ocean, as in Proverbs 8:24, 27, 28, and in Genesis 1:2. Are broken up (niv'kau); properly, were broken up, niph. perfect of baka,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) to cleave asunder,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to break forth, as water, in Isaiah 35:6.NEWLINENEWLINEThe perfect describes a past act, but one that is still continuing in effect. Cf. Vulgate eruperunt, \"they burst forth;\" LXX., ἐῥῤάγησαν, aorist 2 passive of ῤήγνυμι, \"to burst forth,\" Targum, rupti sunt; and Syriac, ruptae sunt. The idea of division or separation is present, but it is not the predominant idea. There seems to be no allusion here either to the Deluge (Beds), nor to the cleaving of the waters of the Red Sea (Gejerus), though both of these historical events were undoubtedly well known to the teacher. And the clouds drop down the dew. The clouds (sh'khakim) are properly the ether, the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere, and then \"the clouds,\" as in Psalm 77:15, which are formed by the condensation of vapours drawn by solar influence from the surface of the earth - seas, rivers, etc. The singular shakhak signifies \"dust,\" and. secondly \"a cloud,\" evidently from the minute particles of moisture of which a cloud is composed. Drop down (yir'aphu, kal future of raaph, used as a present or imperfect); LXX., ἐῥῤύησαν, \"let flow.\" The clouds discharge their contents in showers, or distil at evening in refreshing dew. Modern science agrees with the meteorological fact here alluded to, of the reciprocal action of the heavens and the earth. The moisture drawn from the earth returns again \"to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud, to give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater\" (Isaiah 55:10). Dew; tal, here used not only of dew, but of rain in gentle and fructifying showers. The Arabic word signifies \"light rain;\" LXX., δρόσους, \"dew.\" Moses, in describing the blessing of Israel, says, \"His heavens shall drop down dew\" in the same sense (Deuteronomy 38:28; cf. Job 36:28). The fertilization of the earth is ordered by the Divine Wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - My son, let not them depart from thine eyes. After the description of the power of Wisdom exhibited in creating and sustaining the earth, the exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily before the eyes, and the promises of Divine protection, appropriately follow. Since Wisdom is so powerful, then, the teacher argues, she is worthy of being retained and guarded, and able to protect. Let them not depart (al-yaluzu); i.e. \"let them not escape or slip aside from your mind (cf. Vulgate, ne effluant haec ab oculis ruts). They are to be as frontiers between your eyes, as a ring upon your finger. Yaluzu, from luz, \"to bend aside,\" defiectere, a via declinare, which see in Proverbs 2:15, ought probably to be written yellezu, on the analogy of the corresponding passage in Proverbs 4:21. The LXX. renders absolutely μὴ παραῥῤύης, \"do not thou pass by,\" from παραῥῤύω, \"to flow by,\" \"to pass by, recede\" (cf. Hebrews 2:1, \"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to these things, lest at any time we should let them slip (μὴ ποτε παραῥῤυῶμεν),\" quoted probably from the LXX. of this passage). The Targum Jonathan reads ne vilescat, \"let it,\" i.e. wisdom, \"not become worthless.\" Them, included in the verb yaluzu of which it is subject in the original, is to be referred either to \"sound wisdom and discretion\" of ver. 21b - so Gejerus, Cartwright, Geier, Umbreit, Hitzig, Zockter, Plumptre (a similar trajection occurs in Deuteronomy 32:5, and is used, as here, to give vividness to the description): or to \"wisdom, understanding, knowledge,\" of the preceding verses - so Delitzsch and Holden. The first view in every way seems preferable, and it is no objection to it that \"sound wisdom\" (tushiyyah) and \"discretion\" (m'yimmah) are feminine, while the verb \"depart\" (yaluzu) is masculine (see Gesenius, *Gram.,' § 147). The Syriac reads, \"Let it not become worthless (ne vile fit) in thine eyes to keep my doctrine and my counsels.\" Keep sound wisdom and discretion. Keep; n'zor, kal imperative of natsar, \"to watch, guard.\" For \"sound wisdom\" (tushiyyah), see Proverbs 2:7. Here used for \"wisdom\" (kokhmah), as \"discretion\" (m'zimmah) for \"understanding\" (t'vunah), to contrast the absolute wisdom and insight of God with the corresponding attributes in man (see Zockler, in loc.). They belong to God, but are conferred on those who seek after Wisdom, and are then to be guarded as priceless treasures. The Vulgate reads, custodi legem et consilium; and the LXX., τήρησον δὲ ἐμὴν βουλὴν καὶ ἔννοιαν, \"guard my counsel and thought.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - So shall they he life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck. So shall they be (n'yikva); and they shall be. The \"soul\" and \"neck\" stand for the whole man in his twofold nature, internal and external. Life is in its highest and widest sense given to the soul (see Proverbs 2:16, 18; Proverbs 4:22; Proverbs 8:35), and favour is conferred on the man, i.e. he becomes acceptable to his neighbours, if he has wisdom. The latter expression is very similar to Proverbs 1:9, where the same promise is expressed, \"grace\" (hon) being equivalent to \"ornament of grace\" (liv'yath hon). Others understand \"grace to thy neck\" (hon l'garg grotheyka), as gratia guttturis, in the sense of \"grace of the lips,\" as in Psalm 45:3 and Proverbs 22:11, that is, as the grace of speaking, power of eloquent and effective utterance (Gejerus, Bayne, Lapide). It is better to take it as referring to the adornment of the personal character, and so by metonymy of the favour and kindness which it procures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Then shall thou walk in thy way safely. The first of the promises of protection, which follow from vers. 23-26. He who keeps \"sound wisdom and discretion\" shall enjoy the greatest sense of security in all situations of life. Safely (lavetakh); either in confidence, as Vulgate fiducialiter, i.e. confidently, because of the sense of security (cf. LXX., πεποιθὼς ἐν εἰρήνῃ, and ver. 26); or in security: the adverb lavetakh is equivalent to betakh in Proverbs 1:30 and Proverbs 10:9. The allusion is obvious. As he who is accompanied by an escort proceeds on his way in safety, so you protected by God will pass your life in security; or, as Trapp, \"Thou shalt ever go under a double guard, 'the peace of God' within thee (Philippians 4:7), and the 'power of God' without thee (1 Peter 1:5).\" And thy foot shall not stumble; literally, and thou shall not strike thy foot. Stumble in the original is thiggoph, 2 singular kal future of nagaph, \"to smite, .... strike against with the foot.\" So in Psalm 91:12. The Authorized Version, however, correctly gives the sense. The LXX., like the Authorized Version, makes \"foot\" the subject, Ὁ δὲ ποῦς σου σὺ μὴ προσκόψῃ, \"(That) thy foot may not stumble.\" For a similar assurance, see Proverbs 4:12. The meaning is: You will not stumble, because you will be walking in the way of wisdom, which is free from stumbling blocks (Lapide). You will not fall into sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - When thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid. This is beautifully illustrated by what David says in Psalm 4:8, \"I will both lay me down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.\" No fear is to be apprehended where Jehovah is Protector (see Psalm 3:5, 6; Psalm 46:1-3; Psalm 91:1-5; Psalm 121:5-8). When, (im) is rendered \"if\" by the Vulgate, LXX., Targum Jonathan. Thou liest down; tish'kav, \"thou shalt lie down,\" kal future, like shakavta, kal perfect, in the corresponding hemistich, is from shakav, \"to lie down,\" specially to lay one's self down to sleep, as in Genesis 19:4; Psalm 3:6. Vulgate, si dormieris; cf. Proverbs 6:22, \"when thou sleepest\" בְּשָׁכְבְּך, b'shok'b'ka). The LXX. rendering, \"if thou sittest\" (κάθη), arises from reading תֵּשֵׁב (teshev) for תִּשְׁכַב (tish'kav) Yea, thou shalt lie down; b'shok'b'ta, as before, with] prefixed, equivalent to the future, as in the Authorized Version; LXX., καθεύδῃς. Shall be sweet; arvah, from arav, \"to be sweet,\" or \"pleasant,\" perhaps \"well mixed,\" as arev, equivalent to \"to mix.\" Thy sleep shall be full of pleasing impressions, not restless, as in Deuteronomy 28:66 and Job 7:4, but sweet, because of the sense of safety, and from confidence in God, as well as from a good conscience (cf. Job 11:18, \"Thou shalt take thy rest in safety,\" from which the idea is probably taken).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Be not afraid; al-tirah, is literally \"fear thou not,\" the future with al preceding being used for the imperative in a dehortative sense, as in Genesis 46:3; Job 3:4, 6, 7 (see Gesenius, 'Gram.,' § 127. 3, c); Vulgate, ne paveas. Others, however, render, as the LXX., οὐ φοβηθήσῃ, \"Thou shalt not be afraid,\" in the sense of a promise. The verb yare, from which tirah, is here followed by min, as in Psalm 3:7; Psalm 27:1, and properly means \"to be afraid from or before\" some person or thing. Sudden; pithom, an adverb used adjectively (cf. like use of adverb khinnam in Proverbs 26:2). Fear (pakhad); as in Proverbs 1:16, the object which excites terror or fear, as any great disaster. The desolation of the wicked (shoath r'shaim) may be taken eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as the desolation made by the violence of the wicked, the desolation or strum which they raise against the righteous (so the LXX., Vulgate, Mariana, Michaelis, Hitzig, and others); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the desolation which overtakes the wicked, the desolating vengeance executed upon them (so Doderlein, Lapide, Stuart, Muensch., Delitzsch, Wardlaw). The latter is probably the right interpretation, and agrees with the threatening language of Wisdom against her despisers, in Proverbs 1:27, where shdath also occurs. Iu the desolation which shall overwhelm the wicked he who has made Wisdom his guide shall be undismayed, for the Lord is his confidence. The passage was probably suggested by Proverbs 5:21, \"Neither shalt thou be afraid of desolation when it cometh.\" Lee, in loc. cit., says the places are almost innumerable where this sentiment occurs. Compare the fearlessness of the man of integrity and justice, in Horace -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Si fractus illabatur orbis,NEWLINEImpavidum ferient ruinae.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Horace, 'Od.,' 3:3, 7, 8.)NEWLINENEWLINE\"Let Jove's dread arm with thunders rend the spheres,NEWLINEBeneath the crush of worlds undaunted he appears.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Francis's Trans.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Thy confidence (v'kis'leka); literally, as thy confidence. Kesel, primarily \"loin\" or \"flank,\" as in Leviticus 3:14; Leviticus 10:15; Job 15:27, is apparently used here in its secondary meaning of \"confidence,\" \"hope,\" as in Job 8:14; Job 31:24; Psalm 78:7. The בְ (v') prefixed is what is usually termed the בְ essentiae, or בְ pleonasticum (equivalent to the Latin tanquam, \"as\"), and serves to emphasize the connection between the predicate \"thy confidence\" and the subject \"Jehovah\" (cf. Exodus 18:4; see Ewaht, 'Lehrb.,' 217, f.; and Gesenius, 'Gram.,' § 154). Jehovah shall be in the highest sense your ground and object of confidence. Delitzsch describes kesel as confidence in the presence of evil: Jehovah in the presence of the \"sudden fear,\" and of \"the desolation of the wicked,\" the evils and calamities which overwhelm the wicked, shall be thy confidence. The sense of his all-encircling protection will render you undismayed. The meaning given to kesel as \"foolhardiness\" (Psalm 49:14) and \"folly\" (Ecclesiastes 7:25). and the connection of kesel with k'silim in Proverbs 1:22, comes from the root idea kasal, \"to be fleshly, or fat,\" the signification of which branches out on the one side into strength and boldness, and on the other into languor and inertness, and so folly or confidence in self (Schultens, i.e.). The Talmudic rendering of the Rabbi Salomon approximates to this meaning, \"and the things in which you seemed to be foolish (desipere videbaris) he will be at once present with you.\" Others, as Ziegler, Muentinghe, gave kesel its primary meaning, and translate, \"Jehovah shall be as thy loins,\" the loins being regarded as the emblem of strength. Jehovah shall be your strength. But kesel does not appear to have this local application here. Wherever it is used in this sense, as in Job and Leviticus cited above, there is something in the context to point it out as a part of the body. Compare, however, the Vulgate. in latere suo, \"in thy side or flank.\" The LXX. renders, ἐπὶ πασῶν ὁδῶν σου, \"over all thy ways.\" From being taken (millaked); Vulgate, ne capiaris, \"lest thou be taken.\" The meaning is, Jehovah will be your protection against all the snares and traps which the impious lay for you. Leked, \"a being taken,\" is from lakad, \"to take or catch animals\" in a net or in snares. It only occurs here in the Proverbs. Its unusual appearance, together with other reasons, not tenable, however, has led Hitzig to reject vers. 22-26 as an interpolation. The LXX. reads, πτόησιν, pavorem. Πτόησις, in Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, is used subjectively, and means \"any vehement emotion.\" The word only occurs once in the New Testament in 1 Peter 3:6, μὴ φοβούμενη μηδεμίαν πτόησιν, where it is evidently quoted from the passage before us, in an objective sense, and designates some external cause of terror (cf. Authorized Version, \"and be not afraid with any amazement;\" see also Book of Common Prayer: 'Solemnization of Matrimony,' ad fin).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-35. - 6. Sixth admonitory discourse. In this discourse the teacher still carries on his object, which is to demonstrate the conditions upon which true wisdom and happiness are to be attained. The discourse differs from the preceding in consisting of detached proverbs, and may be divided into two main sections - the first (vers. 27-30) enjoining benevolence, that love to one's neighbour which is the fulfilling of the Law; the second warning against emulating the oppressor and associating with him, because of the fate of the wicked (vers. 31-35). It is observable that all the maxims have a negative form, and thus present a striking contrast to the form adopted by our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5.), and to the admonitions at the close of St. Paul's Epistles. In one instance in particular (ver. 30), the teaching does not reach the high moral standard of the gospel (see Delitzsch and Lange). Verse 27. - Withhold not good from them to whom it is due. This precept indicates the general principle of beneficence, and not merely, as the words at first sight seem to imply, restitution (as Cajet.). We are to do good to those who are in need or deserving of it, whenever we have the means and opportunity. From them to whom it is due (nib'alayv); literally, from its owner, from baal, dominus, \"lord\" or owner of a thing. Cf. Proverbs 16:22, \"Prudence is a fountain of life to its owner (b'alayv);\" 1:19; 17:8; and also Ecclesiastes 8:8; Ecclesiastes 7:12; - in all of which passages proprietorship in the thing or quality mentioned is expressed. The owners of good are those to whom good is due or belongs either by law or by morality, whether by desert or need. The latter qualification is the one emphasized in the LXX, Μὴ ἀπόσχῃ ε΅ν ποιεῖν ἐνδεῆ, \"Abstain not from doing good to the needy.\" So the Arabic pauperi. The Targum and Syriac put the precept in more general terms, \"Cease not to do good,\" without indicating in particular anyone who is to be the recipient of the good. But the Jewish interpreters generally (e.g. Ben Ezra) understand it of the poor, egentibus. The Vulgate puts an entirely different interpretation on the passage: Noli prohibere benefacere eum qui potest; si vales, et ipse benefac, \"Do not prohibit him who can from doing good; if you are able, do good also yourself.\" It thus implies that we are to put no impediment in the way of any one who is willing to do good to others, and enjoins the duty on ourselves also. Good (tov); i.e. \"good\" under any form, any good deed or act of beneficence. The principle brought forward in this passage is that what we possess and is seemingly our own is in reality to be regarded as belonging to others. We are only stewards of our wealth. In the power of thine hand (lel yad'yka); literally, in the power of thine hands. For the dual, yad'yka, the Keri substitutes the singular, yad'ka, to harmonize it with the similar expression, lel yadi, \"in the power of thy hand,\" which occurs in Genesis 31:27; Deuteronomy 28:32; Nehemiah 5:5; Micah 2:1. But there is no grammatical need for the emendation. Both the LXX. and Targum employ the singular, \"thy hand.\" Power (el); here \"strength\" in the abstract. Usually it means \"the strong,\" and is so used as an appellation of Jehovah. though, as Gesenius says, those little understand the phrase who would render el here \"by God.\" The לְ prefixed to el indicates the condition. The meaning of the phrase is, \"While it is practicable, and you have the opportunity and means of doing good, do it.\" Do not defer, but do good promptly. The passage receives a remarkable illustration in the language of St. Paul, \"While we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men\" (Galatians 6:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The precept of this and that of the preceding verse are very closely related. The former precept enjoined the general principle of benevolence when we have the means; this carries on the idea, and is directed against the postponement of giving when we are in a position to give. In effect it says, \"Do not defer till tomorrow what you can do today.\" This \"putting off\" may arise from avarice, from indolence, or from insolence and contempt. These underlying faults, which are incompatible with neighbourly good wilt, are condenmed by implication. Unto thy neighbour; l'reayka, \"to thy friends,\" the word being evidently used distributively. Reeh is \"a companion\" or \"friend\" (cf. Vulgate, amico tuo; Syriac, sodali tuo), and generally any other person, equivalent to the Greek ὁ πλησίον, \"neighbour.\" The Authorized Version correctly renders \"come again,\" as shav is not merely \"to return,\" but to return again to something (so Delitzsch); cf. Vulgate, revertere; and as the words, \"tomorrow I will give thee,\" show. The LXX. adds, \"For thou knowest not what the morrow may bring forth,\" probably from Proverbs 17:1. If viewed in respect of the specific claims which servants have for work done, the precept is a re-echo of Leviticus 29:13 and Deuteronomy 24:15. In illustration of the general scope of the passage, Grotius quotes, \"A slow-footed favour is a favour without favour.\" Seneca says in the same spirit, \"Ingratum est beneficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit,\" \"The benefit is thankless which sticks long between the hands of the giver\" (Seneca, 'Benef.,' 1:2); cf. also Bis dat qui cito dat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDevise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Devise not evil against thy neighbour. This precept is directed against abuse of confidence. Devise not evil (al takharosh raah). The meaning of this expression lies between \"fabricating evil\" and \"ploughing evil.\" The radical meaning of kharash, from which takharosh, is \"to cut into,\" \"to inscribe\" letters on a tablet, cognate with the Greek χαράσσειν, \"to cut into.\" But it is used in the sense of \"to plough\" in Job 4:18, \"They that plough iniquity (khar'shey aven),\" and Psalm 129:3, \"The ploughers ploughed (khar'shim khar'shim) upon my back\" (cf. Hosea 10:13). This also appears from the context to be the meaning in Proverbs 6:14. With these we may compare such expressions as \"to plough a lie\" (μὴ ἀροτρία ψεύδος, rendered in the Authorized Version, \"Devise not a lie\"); see Proverbs 7:12, and \"to sow iniquity,\" Proverbs 22:8 - a cognate figure. \"To plough evil\" is to devise evil, to prepare for it, just in the same way as a ploughman prepares the land for sowing. In this sense the verb is understood by the older commentators and by Ewald and Delitzsch. On the other hand, the verb may be used in its other signification, \"to fabricate,\" and hence \"to contrive.\" The noun kharash is an artificer of iron, etc. (Exodus 35:35; Deuteronomy 27:15). \"To fabricate evil\" is, of course, as the Authorized Version \"to devise evil.\" The LXX., μὴ τεκτῄνη, from τεκτείνομαι, \"to build,\" inclines to this sense. The Vulgate, ne moliaris, does not clear up the point, though moliri, usually \"to contrive,\" is used by Virgil, 'Georg.,' 1:494, \"moliri terrain,\" of working or tilling the ground. The verb also occurs in Proverbs 6:19; Proverbs 12:20; Proverbs 14:22. Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee; i.e. as the Vulgate, cure ille in te habet fiduciam, \"when he has confidence in thee;\" so the LXX.; or, as the Targum and Syriac, \"when he dwells with thee in peace.\" To dwell (yashar) is in Psalm 1:1 \"to sit with any one,\" i.e. to associate familiarly with him (cf. Psalm 26:4, 5); but it also has the meaning , \"to dwell,\" and the participle yoshev, here used; in Genesis 19:23: Judges 6:21, means \"an inhabitant, a dweller.\" Securely (lavetah); i.e. with full trust (see on ver. 23). Devising evil against a friend is at any time reprehensible, but to do so when he confides in and is altogether unsuspicious of you, is an act of the greatest treachery, and an outrage on all law. human and Divine. It implies dissimulation. It is the very sin by which \"the devil beguiled Eve through his subtlety\" (Wardlaw).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStrive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The meaning of the precept in this verse is clear. We are nat to strive or quarrel with a man unless he has first given us offence. So Le Clerc, \"Nisi injuria prior lacessiverit.\" The admonition is directed against those who, from spite, jealousy, or other reasons, \"stir up strife all the day long\" with those who are quiet and peaceable. Strive. The Keri here reads tariv for the Khetib taruv, but without any change of meaning. The verb ruv, from which taruv, is \"to strive or contend with the hand and with blows,\" as in Deuteronomy 33:7; or with words, as in Psalm 103:9 (cf. the Vulgate, ne contendas; and the LXX, μὴ φιλεχθήσης, \"Do not exercise enmity,\" from the unusual φιλεχθρέω. Ruv is here followed by עִם (im), as in Job 9:3; Job 40:2; and Genesis 26:30 Its forensic sense, \"to contend with in law,\" does not strictly apply here, though the precept may be taken as discouraging litigation (Lapide). Without cause (khinnam); LXX., ματήν, equivalent to δωρεάν, in John 15:25; Vulgate, frustra; further explained in the concluding clause (see on Proverbs 1:17). If he have done thee no harm. The phrase, gumal raah, is to bring evil upon any one (Schultens). The verb gamal signifies \"to do, to give, to show to any one.\" Holdea renders, \"Surely he will return thee evil,\" in the sense that unprovoked attack ensures retaliation.]gut this is to ignore the negative force of im-lo, \"if not.\" The verb sometimes means \"requiting,\" but not in the passage before us, nor in Proverbs 11:17; Proverbs 31:12. The Vulgate renders as the Authorized Version, Cum ipse tibi nihil mali fecerit. It is to be remarked that this precept falls below the moral standard of the New Testament teaching (see Matthew 5:39-41; Romans 12:17-21; 1 Corinthians 6:6-8), and of the example of our Lord, of whom it was predicted that \"When he was reviled, be reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not\" (see Isaiah 53).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEnvy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. The thought of strife in the preceding verse leads to that of oppression, and the precept is directed against fellowship with those who outrage the general law of benevolence and justice, Envy not; i.e. as Stuart, \"Do not anxiously covet the booty which men of violence acquire.\" Success and wealth may follow from severity and extortion, but the man who acquires prosperity by these means is not to be envied even by the victim of his oppression (for the verb, see Proverbs 23:17; Proverbs 24:1, 19). The oppressor (ish khamas); literally, a man of violence (see margin). The expression occurs in Proverbs 14:29; Psalm 18:41, and in its plural form, ish khamamim, \"man of violences,\" in 2 Samuel 22:49; Psalm 140:1, 4. The man of violence is one who \"grinds the faces of the poor,\" and whose conduct is rapacious, violent, and unjust. And choose none of his ways; literally, and choose not all his ways, i.e. with a view to acquire the same wealth, greatness, and power. The LXX. renders this verse, \"Do not acquire the hatred of evil men, neither be jealous of their ways,\" evidently from having taken tiv'khar, \"choose,\" in the second hemistich, for tith'khan, \"be jealous.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - This verse gives the reason for the previous warning. The oppressor is here included under the more general term, \"the froward.\" The froward; naloz, hiph. participle from luz, \"to bend aside,\" and hence a perverted or wicked man, one who turns aside from the way of uprightness, a transgressor of the Law (cf. LXX., παράνομος); and so the opposite of \"the righteous,\" y'sharim, \"the upright,\" those who pursue the path of justness, or the straightforward. Abomination (toevah); i.e. an abhorrence, something which, being impure and unclean (cf. LXX., ἀκάθαρτος), is especially abhorrent to Jehovah. In some passages it is connected with idolatry, as in 1 Kings 14:24 and 2 Kings 23:13, but is never used in this sense in the Proverbs, where it occurs about twenty times (see Proverbs 28:9; Proverbs 21:27; Proverbs 11:1, 20, etc.). The passage shows that prosperity and worldly success are not always a true measure of Divine favour. His secret (sodo); Vulgate, sermocinatio. Here sod probably means \"familiar intercourse,\" as in Job 29:4 and Psalm 25:14; and hence the special favour with which Jehovah regards the upright, by revealing to them what he conceals item others, or his friendship (compare what our Lord says in John 15:14, 15). Dathe translates \"probis vero est familiaris.\" Gesenius says sod properly means \"a couch,\" or triclinium on which people recline; but Delitzsch derives it from the root sod, \"to be firm,\" \"compressed,\" and states that it therefore means properly \"a being together, or sitting together.\" The LXX. eontinues the \"froward man\" (παράνομος) as the subject, and renders, \"Every transgressor is impure before God, and does not sit together with (οὐ συνεδριάζει) the just.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked. From ver. 33 to the end of the discourse the contrast is continued between the condition of the wicked and the just, the scornful and the lowly, the wise and the fools. In the verse before us a further reason is given why the prosperity of the wicked is not enviable. The curse of Jehovah dwells in and rests upon his house. The curse; m'erah, from arav, \"to curse.\" This word only occurs five times in the Old Testament once in Deuteronomy, twice in Proverbs (here and in Proverbs 28:27), and twice in Malachi. The nature of the curse may be learned from Deuteronomy 28:20, where it is the infliction of temporal misfortunes ending with the \"cutting off\" of the wicked (see Psalm 37:22). It is a hovering evil, the source of constant misfortune. LXX., κατάρα. Cf. \"the cursing\" (alah) against thieves and swearers in Zechariah 5:4. But he blesseth the habitation the just. The contrast to the former, as in Deuteronomy 28:2-6. He blesseth; i.e. both temporarily and spiritually. Blessing does not exclude affliction, but \"trials\" are not \"curses\" (Wardlaw). Both the LXX. and the Vulgate render, \"But the habitations of the just shall be blessed,\" the LXX. having read the pual future (y'vorak), \"they shall be blessed,\" for the piel future (y'varik), \"he shall bless,\" of the text. The habitation; naveh, from navah, \"to sit down,\" \"to dwell.\" A poetic and nomad (Fleischer) word usually understood of a small dwelling is tugurium, the shepherd's hut or cottage, \"the sheepcote\" of 2 Samuel 7:8. The LXX. ἕπαυλις, and tho Vulgate hubitaculam, favour the suggestion of Gejerus, that a contrast is here made between the large house or palace (bayith) of the wicked and the small dwelling of the just. In Proverbs 21:20 and Proverbs 24:15 the word is rendered \"dwelling.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Surely he scorneth the scorners; literally, if with regard to the scorners he scorneth (im lalletsim hu yalits); i.e. he repays scorn with scorn; or, as Rabbi Salomon, \"He renders to them so that they fall in their own derision (reddit ipsis ut in sua derisione corruant).\" He renders their schemes abortive. He resists them. The scorners (letsim) are those who treat with scoffing regard the precepts and truths of God; the arrogant, proud, insolent, here placed in contrast with \"the lowly.\" Vulgate, derisores; LXX., ὐπερήφανοι, \"the overbearing.\" The לְ for (l'ha), prefixed to letsim, signifies \"with regard to,\" as in Job 32:4 (cf. Psalm 16:3, \"With regard to the saints (lik'ddshim), in them only I delight\"). But he giveth grace unto the lowly; or, on the other hand, the לְה prefixed to laanayim, \"to the lowly,\" having that antithetical force here as in Job 8:20. The lowly (anayyim); Vulgate, mansueti; LXX., ταπωῖνοι; properly, \"the afflicted,\" with added notion of submission and lowly demeanour, and hence the meek, gentle - the gentle towards man, and the abased and lowly before God. St. James (James 4:6) quotes the LXX. of this passage, \"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.\" With the exception of substituting Κύριος for Θεός (cf. 1 Peter 5:5), our Lord's parable of the Pharisee and publican illustrates the teaching of this verse (Luke 18:9-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs3:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The wise shall inherit glory. Proverbs 11:2 indicates that \"the wise\" here are to be identified with \"the lowly\" of the preceding verse. Inherit; succeed to it as a matter of course by hereditary right as sons. Heirship implies sonship. Glory (kavod); or, honour; not merely earthly distinction and splendour, the glory of man, but the \"glory of God.\" But shame shall be the promotion of fools; or, as margin, shame exalteth the fools. The rendering of the original, vuk'silim merim kalon, depends upon the meaning to be given to merim, the hiph. participle of rum, hiph. \"to lift up, exalt;\" and whether the plural, k'silim, in a distributive sense, as in ver. 18, or kalon, is the subject. Various interpretations have been given of the passage.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The Vulgate renders, stultorum exaltatio ignominia; i.e. as in the Authorized Version, \"shame exalts fools.\" They \"glory in their shame\" (Philippians 2:19); or shame renders them conspicuous as warning examples (Ewald); or, as Dathe explains it, \"Stulti infamia sunt famosi,\" \"Fools become famous by infamy;\" or as Rabbi Levi, \"Shame exalts them as into the air, and makes them vanish away.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The LXX. renders, Αἱ ἀσεβεῖς ὕψωσαν ἀτιμίαν, i.e. \"Fools exalt shame, prize what others despise\" (Plumptre).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Umbreit, Bertheau, Zockler, render, \"Shame sweeps fools away,\" i.e. lifts them up in order to sweep away and destroy them (cf. Isaiah 57:14).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The true rendering seems to be given by Michaelis, \"Fools carry away shame\" as their portion. So the Targum, Delitzsch, Hitzig, Wordsworth. They look for \"promotion.\" They attain such as it is, but the end of their attainments is \"shame and everlasting contempt.\" As the wise inherit glory, so fools get as their portion shame and ignominy.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-27. - 7. Seventh admonitory discourse. We here enter upon the second group of admonitory discourses, as is indicated by the opening address, \"my children,\" and which occurs again in Proverbs 5:7 and Proverbs 7:24. This group extends to the end of ch. 7. Its prevailing tone is that of warning rather than of positive exhortations, which have been the rule hitherto. The general aim of the discourse before us, as of those preceding, is to exalt Wisdom, to exhibit her as a subject worthy of all earnest endeavour and sacrifice, but it is noticeable that the teacher introduces a fresh feature into his teaching or mode of instruction, in order to procure attention to, and acceptance of, his precepts on the part of his hearers. He has already spoken in his own name and with his own authority; he has brought forward Wisdom personified as making her appeal; he now adduces the authority of his own father's advice to himself. But as the mode of emphasizing his admonitions varies, so Wisdom is many-sided, and the aspect under which she is now presented seems to be especially that of discipline and obedience. The keynote of the discourse seems to be struck in the word \"instruction,\" i.e. discipline, in the original, musar, thus recalling the admonition in Proverbs 1:8, \"My son, hear the instruction of thy father.\" Bohlius, in his 'Ethica Sacra,' disp. 6. p. 65, sqq., assigns \"discipline\" (musar) to this chapter; and Melancthon describes the admonitions of the chapter before us as \"adhortationes ad studium obedientiae.\" Discipline rising into obedience seems to be the predominant thought to which all others are made subordinate. The discourse is an enlargement or amplification of this aspect of Wisdom. In structure the discourse consists mainly of the father's advice (vers. 4-19), preceded and followed by the teacher's own admonitions in vers. 1-3 and 20-27. The chief topics touched upon areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the supreme importance of Wisdom as being \"the principal thing\" to be obtained before everything else (vers. 7-9);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the two ways that lie open to the choice of youth, distinguished respectively as the way of light and the way of darkness (vers. 14-19); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the guarding of the heart with all diligence, as being the seat of conscience and the fountain of life in its moral sense (vers. 23-27). The first part of the discourse is characterized by exhortations accompanied by promises; the latter part takes the form of warning, and warning of an alarming nature. The harmony which exists between the allusions in the discourse and the facts recorded in the historical books of Samuel and Chronicles serves to indicate that we have before us, in substance at least, the advice which David gave to Solomon, and that the discourse is Solomonic. Compare especially ver. 3 with 1 Chronicles 28:5 and 1 Chron 22:9, and ver. 18 with the last words of David in 2 Samuel 23:4. Verse 1. - Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father. This exhortation is identical with that in Proverbs 1:8, except that the address, \"ye children,\" indicating a new departure, is now used instead of \"my son,\" which has been hitherto employed (see Proverbs 1:8; Proverbs 2:1; Proverbs 3:1, 21), and \"of thy father\" is altered to \"of a father.\" The verb is the same, occurring here, of course, in the plural number. The appeal is evidently intended to rouse attention. Attention is especially necessary to secure a knowledge of Divine truth. Ye children (bhanim). This address occurs again twice in the second group of admonitory discourses - in Proverbs 5:7 and Proverbs 7:24, and also in the appeal of Wisdom personified in Proverbs 8:32, and, with these exceptions, nowhere else in the Proverbs. It is used by David, and it is possible that when the teacher penned these words he had in mind Psalm 34:11, \"Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.\" The similarity in the address serves to connect the teacher of wisdom with David, and thus to identify him with Solomon, while it also leads to the conclusion that the advice which follows in vers. 4-19 is in substance that which David had given his son. On \"instruction,\" see ch. 1:8. Of a father (av). It is difficult, owing to the want of the pronominal suffix, to determine accurately whether the teacher is referring to himself or to his own father in the expression. The following verseNEWLINENEWLINE(2) would indicate that he is speaking of himself in his capacity as a teacher or instructor of youth. But it is quite possible that he may be referring to his own father, whose advice he had received, and which he is now about to lay before others in vers. 4-19. Though attention to paternal advice in general, i.e. instruction given by any father to his children, is not intended here, still the passage may be regarded as embodying the principle that attention to parental advice is incumbent on children, and a disregard of it is the mark of ingratitude and depravity. Rabbi Levi understands the phrase as referring to our heavenly Father. Attend (hakshivu, hiph. imperative of kashav). On the force of this verb as signifying \"earnest, absorbed attention,\" see Proverbs 1:24. To know understanding (ladaath bina); i.e. in order that you may know or gain understanding. \"The infinitive marks the design or object of the attention (cf. the Vulgate, ut sciatis). `The expression corresponds with ladaath khokmah in Proverbs 1:2, and just as this signifies \"to appropriate to yourself wisdom,\" so the one before us has the same force, and signifies the gaining or appropriation of understanding, i.e. the faculty of discernment or discrimination. Hitzig renders, \"to know with the understanding;\" i.e. to know intelligently, but this does not seem to be the meaning of the phrase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For I give you good doctrine. This, while stating the reason for the exhortation in the previous verse, signifies that what the teacher has given and is giving, he has received from his father. I give; nathati, literally, \"I gave,\" is the kal perfect of nathan, \"to give,\" but the perfect is here used for the present, as denoting not only a past action, but one that is still continuing (Gesenius, 'Hebrews Gram.,' § 126. 3). Good doctrine (lekakh tov). The doctrine or instruction is \"good,\" not only intrinsically, but as to the source from which it was derived, and in its effects. Lekakh is, according to its root lakakh, \"something which is received or taken.\" From the standpoint of the teacher it is that instruction which he had received of his father. With respect to his hearers it is the instruction which is communicated to them, and which they receive (see on Proverbs 1:5). The LXX. renders, δῶρον ἀγαθὸν; similarly the Vulgate, donum bonum, \"a good gift.\" Forsake ye not; al-taazovu, from azav, \"to leave, forsake\" (compare the corresponding phrase, al-tiltosh, from natash, \"to leave, forsake,\" in Proverbs 1:8). Law (torah); as in Proverbs 1:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For I was my father's son. This is more than the mere statement of a physical fact. It indicates that the teacher was in the highest degree an object of endearment to his father, just as he states in the second hemistich that he held a unique position in the affection of his mother. `The statement agrees with the historical record. Solomon would be more than ordinarily dear to his father, as being a child of promise, as \"the beloved of the Lord,\" and as the son whom the Divine will had pointed as the successor to his throne, and the one on whom was to devolve the building of the temple (see 2 Samuel 7:12, 13; 2 Samuel 12:24; 1 Chronicles 22:9). Bertheau explains, \"I also once stood in the relation to my (actual) father in which you stand to me your paternal instructor,\" thus giving prominence rather to the consecution of the passage, and preparing the way for the reception of the father's advice which is to follow. But this rather loses sight of what appears an important element in the instruction, that not only was it \"good,\" but that it was dictated by affection. The writer is fortifying and strengthening his instruction by the authority of his father, showing that what he was laying before others he had had placed before him; and as his father's advice was the outcome of affection, so he addresses his hearers in the same spirit. Dathe and others connect \"tender\" rak) with \"son\" (ben), and render, \"I was a son dear to my father.\" So the LXX., which, however, understands \"tender\" in the sense of \"tractable,\" \"obedient:\" \"For I was an obedient son to my father\" - a meaning which the word rak can only bear as indicating the susceptibility of the young to receive impressions. In general, rak means \"tender,\" \"soft,\" and has reference to the weakness and helplessness of the young; comp. Genesis 33:13, \"My lord knoweth that the children are tender (rakkim).\" Combined with yakhid, which follows, it signifies, in the passage before us, that the teacher was an object of tender care or love. The Vulgate tenellus, the diminutive of tener, as signifying \"somewhat tender or delicate,\" reproduces the idea of the Hebrew rak. In the word the teacher recalls his early lifo and the instruction in wisdom which he received in it. Only beloved; literally, only (yakhid), as \"beloved\" does not occur in the original. The Vulgate renders, unigenitus; Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, μονογενής, i.e. \"only begotten:\" but this was not literally the fact, as Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, had other sons (2 Samuel 5:14; 1 Chronicles 3:5). Both the Hebrew yakhid, \"only,\" and the Vulgate unigenitus, \"only begotten,\" consequently signify what is expressed by the LXX. ἀγαπώμενος, i.e. \"beloved.\" Solomon was so beloved of his mother as if he were an only child. So yakhid is used of Isaac in Genesis 22:2, 12 in the same way, since at the time that Isaac was so designated, Ishmael, the other son of Abraham, was still living. The word yakhid occurs in Psalm 22:20, where it is rendered \"darling,\" and may possibly refer to Solomon. Jennings, in Psalm 22:20, understands it, however, of the life besides which the psalmist has no other - unicam meam, as the Vulgate, i.e. \"his only life\" (cf. Psalm 35:17; and for the word yakhid, see Jeremiah 5:26; Amos 8:10; Zechariah 12:10). In the sight of my mother (liph'ne immi); literally, ad facies matris meae, or, before my mother; Vulgate, coram matre mea, i.e. in her estimation (cf. Genesis 17:18). The mention of the mother is probably introduced here for the sake of poetic parallelism; cf. Proverbs 1:8 (Zockler).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - From this verse to ver. 19 inclusive, the teacher quotes the instruction which he had received of his father. His object in doing so is to show that his own teaching was in harmony with it, and therefore worthy of attention. His precepts, admonitions, and warnings are not his only, but those of his father. Other examples of David's instructions to Solomon are found in 1 Kings 2:2; 1 Chronicles 22:12, 13; 1 Chronicles 28:9. And he taught; i.e. his father, for vayyoreni is masculine. The LXX. renders, \"They said and taught me (οι{ ἔλεγον καὶ ἐδιδασκόν με),\" as if the precepts which follow were the combined teaching of David and Bathsheba. This variation is due to the mention of both parents in the preceding verse. Retain; yith'mok, kal future, used imperatively, of thamak, \"to take hold of,\" and metaphorically, as here, \"to hold fast\" (see Proverbs 3:18). The LXX. Renders ἐρειδέτω, imperative of ἐρείδω, \"to fix firm.\" Symmachus has κατεχέτω, \"give heed to.\" And live; i.e. and thou shalt live, as the kal imperative, kh'yeh, from khayah, \"to live,\" has here the force of the future (cf. Vulgate, et vives). The meaning is, \"And thou shalt enjoy a long and happy life.\" Temporal life alone seems to be indicated, as in ver. 10 (cf. Proverbs 3:2). The Syriac addition, \"And my law as the apple of thine eye,\" is probably borrowed from Proverbs 7:2, where we meet with the mine admonition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGet wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - After the general exhortation given above, the father's instruction becomes more specific, and deals with the acquirement of wisdom. This subject seems to be continued in ver. 13, where the second and concluding branch of the instruction begins, which consists mainly of warning, as the first part does with exhortation. We are thus furnished with an example how to teach. In our teaching it is not sufficient simply to point out what is to be done, but we must show what is to be avoided. Get wisdom, get understanding. The father urges the acquirement of wisdom in the same way and with the same importunity as the trader or merchant presses his goods upon buyers. Wisdom and understanding are put forward as objects of merchandise; for the verb kanah, from which the imperative k'neh, signifies not only \"to acquire for one's self,\" or \"to possess,\" but especially \"to buy.\" The verb occurs again in the same sense in ver. 7, \"Get [k'neh, i.e. buy] wisdom;\" and in Proverbs 23:23, \"Buy (k'neh) the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding\" (cf. also Proverbs 15:22: 16:16; 19:9, where we also meet with the same verb). The reiteration of the word \"get,\" as Umbreit remarks, is \"an imitation of the exclamation of a merchant who is offering his wares.\" The importunity of the father measures the value he sets upon wisdom as an inestimable treasure, a pearl of great price (see Proverbs 3:14). Forget it not, etc.; rather, forget not, neither turn from the words of my mouth, - so Zockler, Delitzsch, Hodg., and others; Vulgate, ne obliviscaris, neque declines a verbis oris mei. There is no need to supply \"it\" after the verb al-tish'-kakh, \"forget not,\" as Holden states, and as appears in the Authorized Version, since shakakh is found with min (מִן), \"of\" or \"from,\" in Psalm 12:4 (5), \"I forgot to eat (shakakh'ti meakol),\" and the same construction may obtain here. The two verbs, \"forget\" and \"decline from,\" are not so very wide in meaning, since the former, shakakh, is to \"leave\" something from forgetfulness, and the latter, natah, rendered here \"decline from,\" is \"to turn away\" from something. The words of my mouth represent as it were the means by which wisdom may be purchased.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom. The older versions, such as the Alexandrian LXX. (the verse is omitted by the Vatican LXX.), Targum, and Syriac, agree in rendering this verse, \"The beginning of wisdom is get wisdom,\" which is equivalent to saying that the beginning of wisdom consists in the acquisition of wisdom, or, as Umbreit explains, \"in the resolution to get wisdom.\" That this rendering, which is adopted by Luther, Delitzsch, and Umbreit, may be correct appears from Proverbs 1:7 and Proverbs 9:10, where we have the same construction, only in inverted order. Seneca's aphorism is conceived in much the same spirit: \"Magna pars boni est velle fieri bonum\" - \"A large part of good is the wish to become good;\" i.e. that the beginning of being good depends to a large extent upon the wish to become so. The objections to this rendering are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That it is difficult to see how the beginning of wisdom can be the acquisition of it.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That elsewhere, as in Proverbs 1:7 and Proverbs 9:10, the beginning of wisdom is represented as the fear of the Lord.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) That it does not fall in well with the context or with the aim of the father's teaching, which is to hold up wisdom as pre-eminently a blessing, as the most excellent and highest thing attainable. On the other hand, Hitzig, De Dieu, Doderlein, Zockler, render as in the Authorized Version, \"Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom;\" i.e. wisdom is the highest good, and therefore ought to be obtained. The word reshith is found with this signification in ch. 24:20; 1 Samuel 2:29; Job 40:19; Jeremiah 49:35; Amos 6:1-6. And with all thy getting get understanding. This does not mean, as the Authorized Version seems to imply, that while you are acquiring other things, you are to acquire wisdom, but that wisdom is to be purchased with all you have acquired or gotten. \"Getting\" (kin'yon) is the purchase money. No price is too high to be paid for her, no sacrifice too great; cf. the parables of the hidden treasure and goodly pearl (Matthew 13:44: Luke 10:42), in both of which the man sold \"all that he had\" to obtain the prize. There is a play upon the words in the original (kin'yan'ki k'neh), which is preserved in our translation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8 - Exalt her, and she shall promote thee. The father here proceeds to point out some of the benefits which follow from the pursuit of Wisdom. Exalt her (sal's'leah); Vulgate, arripe illam; LXX., περιχαράκωσον αὐτὴν; Targum, dilige eam; Syriac, blandire illi; Arabic, circumsepi eam. The Hebrew, sal's'leah, is the pilpel imperative of salal, \"to lift up, exalt.\" It is equivalent to the kal form. The pilpel form only occurs here, but the kal participle is met with in Proverbs 15:19, where it has the meaning of \"to raise up as a causeway\" (see marginal reading in loc.). Gesenius renders, \"exalt her,\" sc. with praises. The meaning of the verb, as Delitzsch says, is to be determined, by the corresponding \"she shall promote thee\" (th'rom'mek), and this verb romem isNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to raise or make high;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to exalt by bestowing honours upon one of low estate, i.e. raising them in general estimation; it is so used in 1 Samuel 2:7 by Hannah, in her song of thankfulness, \"He (Jehovah) bringeth low and lifteth up (m'romem);\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) to extol by praises, as in Psalm 30:2. The radical meaning of salal seems to be \"to heap up,\" as a road is prepared by embankments, and by the filling up of inequalities (cf. Isaiah 62:10). In this sense the passage before us is explained by Levi ben Gersom, \"Prepare the way of Wisdom, and walk assiduously in it.\" But the context, wherein the idea of buying is evidently used. favours Bottcher's interpretation, \"Hold it or her high in price, bid high for her as a purchaser who makes offer upon offer, to secure what he wants.\" So Pi, in pretio habe. The LXX. rendering, \"Circumvallate her, enclose her with a wall or hedge,\" which is reproduced in the Arabic, circumsepi eam, \"hedge her around,\" seems out of place with the context. The Talmudists understand the verb as signifying \"to examine closely,\" \"to scrutinize, meditate, or reflect\" upon Wisdom constantly, just as the Roman, poet says, \"Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna\" - \"We exalt Wisdom when we follow her precepts,\" i.e. when we esteem her - the idea which is presented to us in the Targum and Syriac cited above. The sentiment of the verse agrees with what Jehovah says in the message of the man of God to Eli, in 1 Samuel 2:30, \"Them that honour me I will honour.\" She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. The LXX. reverses the order of ideas, \"Honour her in order that she may embrace thee.\" Embrace her; i.e. in a loving and affectionate manner, as a husband does his wife, or a son his mother. (For the verb khavak, see Proverbs 5:20: Song of Solomon 2:6; Song of Solomon 8:3.) There are only three other instances where this verb occurs in the pilel form, khibbek. Esteem and honour, the confidence of others, elevation to offices of trust and consequence, are some of the rewards with which Wisdom repays those who esteem and love her. Others follow in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - An ornament of grace (liv'yath khen). (On this, see Proverbs 1:9.) A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee; or, as margin, she shall compass thee with a crown of glory. Deliver. The verb miggen, piel, since the kal, magan, is not used. is, however, properly, \"to give, or deliver,\" as in Genesis 14:20; Hosea 11:8. That this is the meaning is clear from the corresponding \"she shall give\" (titten, but cf. nathan, \"to give\"). It is commonly found with an accusative and dative, but here takes two accusatives. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate render, \"With a crown of glory or delights shall she protect (ὑπερασπίση, proteget) thee:\" as if it were connected with magen, \"a shield,\" but a crown is not usually associated with protection or defence. \"A crown of glory,\" in the New Testament, is always associated with the everlasting honours of heaven, as in Hebrews 2:9; 2 Timothy 4:8; 1 Peter 4:4; Revelation 2:20. The meaning is here, \"Wisdom shall confer on thee true dignity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Many commentators, e.g. Jerome, Bede, Ewald, Bertheau, and Hitzig, suppose that the father's instruction closes in the preceding verse, but it seems more appropriate to consider the father as here passing to another branch of his instruction, which is to point out the way of wisdom, and so to prepare for his warnings which follow from ver. 14 to ver. 19. Receive; kakh, from lakah, \"to receive\" (on the force of this verb, see ch. 1:3). He who shows a delighter willingness in admitting the words of Wisdom - for such a character the father claims for his teaching, as we see from, the next verse - shall receive a blessing. It is a sign of grace when any even show themselves open to listen to instruction; but it is a greater sign when this instruction is received with readiness and pleasure (Muffet). The years of thy life (sh'noth khayyim); literally, years of thy lives. The plural \"lives\" expresses the idea of life in the abstract. There is no absolute statement of a future life here, though by the Christian this idea may be indulged in on the ground of a fuller revelation. The promise is one that not only implies the prolongation of life, but also a life of prosperity and enjoyment. Shall be many; literally, shall be multiplied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The perfects, I have taught and I have led, in the original seem to have here the absolute signification of the past. The father recalls the instruction which he has given in times past. So Delitzsch. But Gejerus gives them the combined force of the past and future, \"I have taught and I will more fully teach,\" and so with the other verb. The Vulgate renders, monstrabo, \"I will show,\" and ducam, \"I will lead.\" In the way of wisdom (b'derek khok'mah) may mean \"in the way that leads to, or by which you come to Wisdom; I have taught you the manner in which Wisdom may be attained;\" or \"the way in which Wisdom walks\" (Zockler). The ways of Wisdom are described in Proverbs 3:17 as \"ways of pleasantness.\" The next clause seems to indicate that the latter explanation is to be preferred. The (b) indicates the subject in which instruction has been given. In right paths (b'ma'g'le yosher); literally, in the paths of rectitude; i.e. of straightness, paths of which the characteristic is uprightness. (On \"paths,\" as signifying a carriageway, see Proverbs 2:9.) Instruction and direction have formed the two elements in the father's teaching. These present us with a model of education. \"To teach duty without truth is to teach practice without motive; to teach truth without duty is to teach motive without the practice to which it should lead\" (Wardlaw).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - In this verse the father depicts the benefits and advantages which shall follow from \"receiving his words\" (ver. 10), i.e. from attending to his counsels and imbibing the principles of wisdom. The whole course of life shall be freed from obstacles or impediments, from anxiety, perplexity, or difficulty, or from vacillation. When thou goest may refer to the daily walk, to the common and ordinary events or circumstances incidental to life, just as the corresponding when thou runnest may refer to cases of emergency when promptness and decisive action are called for. In both cases Wisdom, by inspiring unity of principle, gives freedom of movement; in ordinary cases it removes embarrassment and perplexity arising from conflicting interests drawing now in one direction, now in another, and in extraordinary cases it supplies a rule of conduct which prevents our falling into mistakes and errors. Or the verse may refer to the prosperity which shall attend all the undertakings of those who are in Wisdom's ways, whether they advance slowly or rush forward with the impetuosity of youth, whether they act with deliberation or with haste. Shall not be straitened (lo-yetsar); i.e. shall not be narrowed or confined; Vulgate, non arctabuntur; LXX., οὑ συγκλεισθήσεται, The future yetsar only occurs four times in the Scriptures - here, and Job 18:7; Job 20:22; Isaiah 49:19. It is usually derived from the root yatsar, which, however, is not found, cognate with tsur, \"to straiten,\" \"to be narrow.\" Yetsar, however, always occurs in the passive sense, though an active signification is given it by the Rabbi Nathan ben Jechiel, quoted by Delitzsch, in loc., who renders, \"Thou shall not need to bind together, or hedge up thy way.\" The roots yatsar and tsur partake more or less of the idea of binding up, oppressing, putting into narrow and confined circumstances and limits. By the expression that \"the steps are straitened\" we may understand, therefore, that there is a want of freedom for their movements, and consequently that they are impeded or cramped. The Arabic expression. \"to contract the feet,\" signifies the diminishing of good fortune. Compare the similar expression in Job 18:7, \"The steps of his strength shall be straitened.\" The psalmist presents the idea of the verse under a different form, \"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, so that my feet did not slip\" (Psalm 17:36). Thou shalt not stumble; lo-thik-kashel, hiph. future. The niph. nikshal, equivalent to the kal kadshal, signifies properly \"to totter,\" \"to sink down,\" used of one about to fall. The primary idea, however, usually disregarded, of kashal, is \"to totter in the ankles,\" equivalent to the Latin talipedare. It occurs again in Proverbs 4:16, and is a different verb from \"stumble\" in Proverbs 3:23 (which see).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The short but urgent admonitions in this verse may be explained by the knowledge which the father has of the temptations to which youth is exposed and the liability of youth to fall into them, as well as by the fact that Instruction, or Wisdom, is the bestower of life. This latter conviction is the reason why he urges \"taking fast hold\" of Wisdom. The tenacious grasp with which the shipwrecked sinking sailor lays hold on any spar or plank floating near will illustrate the kind of grasp with which Wisdom is to be held. It is no less a virtue to keep and hold fast a good thing than to get it at the first beginning (Muffet). Instruction (musar), usually of a disciplinary nature (see Proverbs 1:3), here more particularly the instruction of the father, but in a wider sense wisdom generally, with which it is synonymous, as appears from the feminine, \"let her not go, keep her,\" musar being masculine; or the feminines may refer back to \"Wisdom\" in ver. 11. So Mercerus and Buxtorf. For she is thy life (ki hi khayyeka); i.e. she brings life to thee. Wisdom is represented as the bestower of long life, in Proverbs 3:2, 16, 18. Just in proportion as Wisdom is retained and guarded, so is life secured, and so far as the hold upon her is lost, so are the hopes of life diminished. Life depends upon the observance of her precepts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEnter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - From admonition the father passes to warning. The connection with the preceding section is obvious. There are two ways diametrically opposite - the way of wisdom and the way of evil; the one the way of life, the other fraught with death, because a way of darkness and violence. As the father has dealt with the former, so now he deals with the latter. With these warnings we may also comp. Proverbs 1:10-15 and Proverbs 2:10-15, where much the same warning is given, and the way of the wicked is described in almost the same terms. The warning of the father takes a threefold form:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) enter not;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) go not;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) avoid.NEWLINENEWLINEIn effect he says this is the only course to be adopted in order to keep a firm hold of Wisdom which he has counselled in the preceding verse (13). Enter not; al-tavo, from bo. \"to come in,\" \"to enter,\" i.e. do not even enter. The Vulgate renders, \"Delight not in,\" evidently from reading tove, which occurs in Proverbs 1:10. But our reading is to be preferred, as avah, \"to acquiesce in,\" from which tov'e, is not used with בִּ, here denoting place, but with לִ. Go not (al-t'ashsher); i.e. do not walk in. The two verbs \"to enter\" (bo) and \"to go\" (ishsher) stand in the relation of entering and going on - ingressus and progressus. So Gejerus and Delitzsch. The piel ishsher, here used, is properly \"to go straight on,\" like the kal ashar, of which it is an intensive (cf. Proverbs 9:6). It is the bold, presumptuous walk, the stepping straight out of the evil, which is here indicated, and against this the father warns his son. The sense is, \"If you have entered the way of the wicked, do not continue or persevere in it.\" The other meanings of the verb ashar, viz. \"to guide straight\" (Proverbs 23:19), \"to esteem happy and prosperous\" (Proverbs 31:28), are not in place here, as they destroy the parallelism of thought, and on the same ground the LXX. and Syriac renderings, \"envy not\" and μηδὲ ζηλώσῆς, are to be rejected. The wicked (ishaim), i.e. the godless (cf, Psalm 1:1), is parallel with \"evil men\" (raim), i.e. the habitually wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAvoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Avoid it; p'raehu, the kal imperative of para, properly, \"to let go,\" hence \"to reject, or abhor.\" (On the verb, see Proverbs 1:25, where it is rendered, \"set at naught.\") The same verb also occurs in Proverbs 8:33; Proverbs 13:18; Proverbs 15:32. It; i.e. the way. The suffix of the verb in the original is feminine, \"avoid her;\" derek, \"the way,\" being common. Turn from it (s'teh mealayv). The original is a pregnant expression equivalent to \"turn aside from it, so that you do not come to stand upon it.\" The word mealayv, equivalent to the Latin desuper ea, has much the same force as the French de dessus and the Italian di sopra (Delitzsch). The verb satah is, as in the Authorized Version, \"to turn, or go aside.\" Pass away; avor, kal imperative of avar, \"to pass over,\" equivalent to Latin transire, here means \"to pass on, or along,\" \"to go beyond,\" like the German Ger weiter gehn. The counsel of the father is not only \"turn aside from,\" but \"put the greatest possible distance between you and it.\" The injunction, so absolutely stated, to have nothing to do with sin, is required, if not indeed prompted, by the knowledge of the fact that youth, confident in its own power of resistance, frequently indulges in the fatal mistake of imagining that it can dally with sin with impunity. The only course compatible with safety is to entirely avoid it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - This verse exhibits the extreme depravity and debasement into which \"the wicked\" (r'shaim) and \"the evil\" (raim) of ver. 14 have fallen. Their sins are not sins of frailty, but arise from premeditation and from their insatiable desire to commit wickedness. Sin has become to them a kind of second nature, and, unless they indulge in it, sleep is banished from their eyes. They sleep not; lo-yish'nu, future of yashan, \"to fall asleep;\" the future here being used for the present, as is frequently the case in the Proverbs, and denoting a permanent condition or habit. Unless they cause some to fall; i.e. \"unless they have betrayed others into sin,\" taking the verb in an ethical sense (Zockler), or, which is preferable, owing to ver. 16a, unless they have done them some injury (Mercerus); Vulgate, nisi supplantaverint. For the Khetib yik'shulu, kal, which would mean \"unless they have stumbled or fallen,\" the Keri substitutes the hiph. yak'shihi \"unless they have caused some to fall.\" The hiph. is found without any object, as here, in 2 Chronicles 25:8). (On the verb khasal, from which it is derived, see ch. 4:12.) With the statement of the verse we may compare David's complaint of the persistent persecution of his enemies (Psalm 59:15), \"If they be not satisfied, then will they stay all night\" (margin). A similar construction to the one before us occurs in Virgil: \"Et si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses\" - \"And had you not, by some means or other done him an injury, you would have died\" ('Eclog.,' 3:15); cf. also Juvenal: \"Ergo non aliter poterit dormire; quibusdam somnum rixa facit\" - \"Therefore, not otherwise, would he have slept; contention to some produces sleep.\" Hitzig rejects vers. 16 and 17 against all manuscript authority.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For (ki, equivalent to the Greek γὰρ) is here explanatory. It serves not so much to introduce another independent statement, as one which accounts for the statement made in the preceding verse, that the wicked sleep not unless they have done mischief, i.e. it states the reason why they are so conditioned. There is no comparison expressed in the original, as the rendering adopted by Schultens and others implies, \"For wickedness do they eat as bread, and violence do they drink as wine,\" which is evidently based on Job 15:16, \"Which drinketh up iniquity like water,\" and Job 34:7, \"Who drinketh up scorning like water.\" The literal rendering is, for they eat the bread of wickedness, and the wine of violence do they drink. The bread of wickedness (lekhem resha) is not bread which consists in wickedness, but bread which is obtained by wickedness, just as the wine of violence (yiyin khamasim) is not the wine which produces violence, but the wine that is procured by violent dee,is. Their support, what they eat and drink, is obtained by wickedness and injustice. They live by wrong. For such expressions as \"the bread of wickedness\" and \"the wine of violence,\" cf. Deuteronomy 16:3, \"the bread of affliction;\" Psalm 127:2, \"the bread of sorrows;\" and Amos 2:8, \"the wine of the condemned.\" There is a charade of tense in the verbs, the first being perfect, \"they have eaten,\" and the second future, \"they shall drink,\" which Delitzsch explains as representing the twofold act - first eating the bread, and then washing it down with wine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A contrast is drawn in this and the following verse between the path of the just and the way of the wicked. The former is, by an extremely beautiful image, likened to the light at dawn, which goes on increasing in brightness and intensity as the day advances, until at length it reaches its meridian splendour and glory. An exactly similar figure is found in David's last words (2 Samuel 23:4). The path of the just; i.e. their moral course. As the shining light (k'or nogah); i.e. as the light of dawn. The word nogah, from nagah, \"to shine,\" is a noun, and properly signifies \"brightness,\" \"shining.\" \"splendour.\" It is used also to designate the dawn, the light of the sun when it first mounts the horizon, and sheds its beams over the landscape, as in Isaiah 9:3, \"Kings (shall come) to the brightness (nogah) of thy rising;\" and Isaiah 62:1, \"Until the righteousness thereof go forth as the brightness (nogah)\" (cf. 2 Samuel 23:4, where the same word also occurs). Michaelis and Schultens refer nogah to \"the path,\" and render, \"The path of the just is splendid as the light.\" So Dathe and others; and in this sense it was understood by the LXX., \"The path of the just shall shine as the light shines.\" The Vulgate renders, quasi lux splendens. That shineth more and more (holek vaor); literally, going and shining - a common Hebrew idiom denoting progression or increase. The construction of the participle holek, from halak, \"to go,\" with the participle of another verb, is found in 1 Samuel 17:41, \"The Philistine came nearer and nearer (holek v'karev);\" 1 Samuel 2:26. \"The child Samuel grew on more and more (holek v'hadel)\" (cf. 2 Chronicles 17:12; Jonah 1:11). Unto the perfect day (ad-n'kon hayyom); Vulgate, usque ad perfectam diem. The Hebrew, n'kon hayyom, corresponds to the Greek, ἡ σταθερὰ, equivalent to \"the high noon,\" when the sun seems to stand still in the heavens. The figure, as Fleiseher remarks, is probably derived from the balance, the tongue of the balance of day, which before or after is inclined either to the right or the left, being at midday perfectly upright, and as it were firm. So kun, the unused kal, from which n'kon, the niph. participle, is derived, is \"to stand upright,\" and in hiph. \"to be set,\" \"to stand firm,\" \"to be established,\" and hence the expression might be rendered, \"until the steady, or established day,\" which, however, refers to the midday, or noon, and not to that point when day succeeds dawn, as Rosenmuller and Schultens on Hosea 6:3 maintain. The comparison is not extended beyond the midday, because the wish of the father was to indicate the full knowledge which the just attain in God, and which can knew of no decline. A similar figure of gradual development is found in our Lord's parable of the seed growing secretly (Mark 4:28), and is visible in Psalm 84:7, \"They grow from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.\" The verse illustrates the gradual growth and increase of the righteous in knowledge, holiness, and joy, all of which are inseparably connected in the career of such.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The way of the wicked is as darkness. In contrast with the path of the just is the way of the wicked, which is described as darkness itself: i.e. so deeply enveloped in gloom that the wicked are not able even to see the obstacles and impediments against which they stumble, and which are the cause of their ruin. It is a way dark throughout - a via tenebrosa (Vulgate) - terminating at length in \"the blackness of darkness.\" As light is emblematical of knowledge, holiness, and joy, so darkness represents ignorance, unholiness, and misery (see Isaiah 8:22). Darkness (aphelah); strictly, thick darkness, midnight gloom, the entire absence of light. It is the word used of the plague of \"thick darkness\" that settled over all the land of Egypt, even a darkness that \"might be felt,\" when the Egyptians \"saw not one another, nor any arose from his place for three days\" (Exodus 10:21-23). It occurs again in ch. 7:9, \"in the black and dark night.\" In this darkness the wicked cannot help but stumble. Compare our Lord's teaching, \"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him\" (John 11:10; cf. 12:36). The expression, they know not at what they stumble, carries with it the idea that they are so ignorant that they neither know wickedness as wickedness, nor do they apprehend the destruction which it involves. \"Sins, however great and detestable they may be, are looked upon as trivial, or as not sins at all, when men get accustomed to them\" (St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' cap. 80). On \"stumble\" (kashal), see ver. 12; and on the destruction of the wicked implied in the stumbling, see Proverbs 1:27, seq., 2:18-22; 3:35.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The teacher here resumes his admonitions after thus citing the example of his father's teaching, and showing how it resembled the tenor of his own precepts, which, upon such a consideration, were most worthy of attention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Let them not depart from thine eyes; i.e. keep them constantly in view as the guide of the whole conduct. These words are a repetition of Proverbs 3:21, just as the latter part of the verse reproduces the thought of Proverbs 2:1. Depart. The hiph. yallizu is here used instead of the kal yaluzu of Proverbs 3:21, but has the same force. In the midst of thine heart; i.e. in its inmost recesses; there the words and sayings are to be guarded as a man guards a treasure stowed away in the inmost chambers of a house. The expression implies cherishing them with an internal affection. The terms of the verse may be illustrated by Deuteronomy 6:6, 8, \"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontiers between thine eyes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They are life; i.e. they bring life (khayyim; the plural, as usual). Unto those that find them; i.e. to those who by effort get possession of and procure them; the verb matsa, to find, embodying the idea of activity. Health; mar'pe, derived from the root rapha, \"to heal\" (like riph'uth of Proverbs 3:8, which see), and hence rather \"the means of health\" than \"health,\" \"healing,\" or, as margin, \"medicine,\" \"that which restores to health;\" LXX., ἴασις; Vulgate, sanitas. The moral condition is regarded as enfeebled by sickness, from which it may be restored to health and soundness by the words of wisdom. The effect of these, however, is not only to restore to health, but to maintain in health. Their tendency is to promote \"a sound mind in a sound body.\" To their flesh; literally, to his flesh; the singular, b'saro, being used instead of the plural, which we should have expected, because what is said applies to each one of those who receive the precepts of wisdom. The all implies the completeness of the restoration; it is not confined to one part, but pervades the whole body.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23 - Keep thy heart with all diligence; properly, above all things that have to be guarded, keep or guard thy heart. So Mercerus, Gescnius, Delitzsch, Zockler. This seems to be the right meaning of the phrase, mikkol-mish'mar, rendered in the Authorized Version \"with all diligence,\" mish'mar, from shamar, \"to guard,\" being the object of guarding; that which is to be guarded. It is as if the teacher said, \"Guard riches, property, health, body, everything, in short, in which you have a legitimate interest, or which is advantageous; but before and above everything else, keep a guard on your heart.\" The rabbins Jarehi, Ben Ezra, Rashi, however, give a different rendering, \"From everything which is to be avoided (ab omni re cavenda) guard thy heart;\" but the objection to this is that it ignores the radical meaning of the verb shamar, from which mish'mar is derived, as stated above, which is not that of avoiding, but of guarding. A third rendering is,\" Keep thy heart with all keeping;\" so the Vulgate, omni custodia serva cor tuum; and the LXX., πασὴ φυλακῇ τήρει σὴν καρδίαν; on which the Authorized Version seems to be based. Another rendering, similar to the first, except that it gives mish'mar the active signification of guarding instead of the passive one of being kept or guarded, is, \"Keep thy heart more than any other keeping (prae omni custodia).\" Origen, 'Hex.;' Field. Again, Aquila and Theodotion render, \"Keep thy heart by reason of every commandment (ἀπὸ παντὸς φυλάγματος),\" thus bringing into prominence the occasion and the obligation of keeping the heart, which is that we are so commanded. Heart (lev); here the affections and the moral consciousness. For out of it are the issues of life. The conjunction \"for\" introduces the reason. The fact here stated is that the moral conduct of life, its actions and proceedings, are determined by the condition of the heart. If the heart is pure, the life will be pure; if the heart is corrupt, the life will be corrupt. The heart is here compared with a fountain. The same idea which is affixed to it in its physical sense is also assigned to it in its ethical or moral sense. Physically, it is the central organ of the body; morally, it is the seat of the affections and the centre of the moral consciousness. From this moral centre flow forth \"the issues of life;\" i.e. the currents of the moral life take their rise in and flow forth from it, just as from the heart, physically considered, the blood is propelled and flows forth into the arterial system, by which it is conveyed to the remotest extremities of the body. And as the bodily health depends on the healthy action of the heart, so the moral health depends on and is influenced by the state in which this spring of all action is preserved. Issues; tots'aoth, from yatsar, \"to go forth,\" are the place from which anything goes forth, and hence a fountain. For \"the issues of life,\" the LXX. reads, ἔξοδοι ζωῆς, the Vulgate., exitus vitae. With this passage compare our Lord's teaching (Matthew 15:19; Mark 7:21-23; Luke 6:43-45).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPut away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The following admonitions of this chapter bear reference to the outward conduct of life. They continue the subject of ver. 23 by showing how the guarding of the heart is to be done. There is the most; intimate connection between the heart as the fountain of the moral life and of the conduct of life, which, though determined by the condition of the heart, in its turn reacts upon the heart as the moral centre, and keeps it pure. Thus the subject is treated from its two sides. On vers. 24 and 25 Hitzig remarks that they \"warn against an arbitrary perverting of the moral judgment into which evil passions so easily betray, and admonish not to give misdirection to thought within the department of morality.\" A froward mouth, and perverse lips; literally, perverseness of mouth and waywardness of lips (ikk'shuth peh vulzuth s'phathayim). \"Perversity of mouth\" is fraudulent, deceitful speech; that which twists, distorts, perverts, or misrepresents what is true, and hence falsehood (Proverbs 4:24; Proverbs 6:12; Proverbs 19:1). The σκολιὸν στόμα of the LXX., i.e. the \"tortuous mouth,\" in a metaphorical sense. The phrase is very similar in meaning with the parallel \"waywardness of lips,\" which means speech which turns aside from what is true and right, the noun lazuth being derived from lazah, or luz, \"to bend aside.\" The tongue is the unruly member (James 3:2). Speech is the index of the mind (Lapide). Vigilance over the heart is vigilance over the mouth, inasmuch as \"out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh\" (Matthew 12:34). The admonition may have a twofold application, and may mean either do not indulge in this kind of speech yourself, exercise an unremitting jealousy over every propensity to it; or have no dealings with those who are guilty of it, as in Psalm 101:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25 - Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids lock straight before thee. \"To look right on\" and \"to look straight before one\" is to fix the eyes steadily and unswervingly upon an object before them, not to allow the gaze to deflect either to the right hand or to the left. As a noun, the word nokakh, rendered \"right on,\" signifies what is straight in front of one; adverbially, it has the same meaning as that given in the Authorized Version. The corresponding \"before\" (neged) is substantively the side of any object which is opposite one, and as a preposition is equivalent to \"before,\" \"in the presence of,\" like the Latin coram. The versions (LXX., Syriac, Targum) take nokakh in the sense of \"right things:\" \"Let thine eyes look at right things;\" contemplate them, aim at justice and equity. This meaning is given to the cognate adjective nakoakh in Proverbs 8:9; Proverbs 24:26; Isaiah 26:10; Isaiah 30:10; Isaiah 59:14; but in the Proverbs the word nokakh only occurs twice (here and ver. 21), either as an adverb, \"right on,\" \"straightforwardly,\" or as a preposition, \"before.\" Look straight. Gesenius takes this verb yashar in hiph., \"to make straight,\" as used elliptically: \"Let thine eyelids direct a way before thee;\" but the meaning is the same as \"Let them look straight before thee.\" The Syriac, Gejerus, and Holden render, \"Let thine eyelids direct thy way before thee;\" i.e. do nothing rashly, but everything with premeditation; examine thy conduct, and see that it is right. The verb yashar has this meaning, \"to direct,\" in Proverbs 3:6; Proverbs 11:5, but it is here used intransitively (Mercerus). Eyelids (aph'appim); so called from their fluttering, rapid motion, here used by way of poetic parallelism with \"eyes.\" What the command inculcates is simplicity of aim or principle, singleness of motive. The moral gaze is to be steadily fixed, because if it wanders indolently, lasciviously, aimlessly, it imperils the purity of the soul. This verse may be understood, as Zockler, as containing a command levelled against dishonest practices. The man who intends to cheat his neighbour looks this way and that how he may deceive him. Such an interpretation may be maintained on the ground that the former verse is directed against falsehood in speech; this against falsehood in action. But the former view is preferable. If you wish to keep the heart, you must be guided by simplicity of aim; look not aside either to the one hand or to the other, lest you may be led astray by the seductions and temptations which imperil the onward and upward progress of the soul. The passage reminds us of the \"single eye\" (ἄπλους), \"simple,\" i.e. intent on heaven and God, of Matthew 6:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPonder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Ponder the path of thy feet; properly, make straight or level the path of thy feet. The command carries on the idea of the previous verse. Simplicity of aim in the moral life is to be accompanied by attention to the moral conduct. The sense is, remove every obstacle which may impede or render insecure the way of moral life, and thus avoid every false step. The meaning \"to ponder,\" i.e. \"to weigh,\" seems to be given to the verb palles, piel of the unused palas here used only in Psalm 58:3 and possibly in Proverbs 5:21. Its ordinary signification is \"to make level, or even,\" as in Isaiah 26:7; Isaiah 40:12; and Proverbs 5:6. The LXX. keeps this in view in rendering, \"Make straight paths for thy feet\" (cf. Hebrews 12:13). The Authorized Version would mean, \"Weigh your conduct as in a balance; before acting, consider the consequences and nature of the act.\" The second clause, and let all thy ways be established, is in effect only a repetition of the preceding thought, since it signifies, \"See that thy conduct is correct; let all thy ways be definite and fixed.\" The marginal reading. \"And all thy ways shall be ordered aright.\" gives the literal rendering to the tense; yikkonu being the future hiph. of kun, \"to be established,\" \"to stand firm.\" This would express the result of giving heed to one's conduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - This verse, with which the teacher closes this discourse, is very closely connected with ver. 26, which it more fully explains. The command is the parallel of ver. 25. As in ver. 25, the gaze is to be concentrated. So here the feet are not to deflect nor turn aside to byways. Nothing is to be permitted to draw one off from the right way, neither adversity, nor prosperity, nor anything which can possess the power of temptation (Bayne and Wardlaw). Remove thy foot from evil. A fuller expression than \"depart from evil,\" of Proverbs 3:7. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate add, \"For the Lord knows the ways which are on thy right hand; but they are perverse which are on thy left. He shall make thy paths straight, and shall advance thy ways in peace.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-23. - 8. Eighth admonitory discourse. Warning against adultery, and commendation of marriage. The teacher, in this discourse, recurs to a subject which he has glanced at before in Proverbs 2:15-19, and which he again treats of in the latter part of the sixth and in the whole of the seventh chapters. This constant recurrence to the same subject, repulsive on account of its associations, shows, however, the importance which it had in the teacher's estimation as a ground of warning, and that he ranked it among the foremost of the temptations and sins which called the young off from the pursuit of Wisdom, and so led them astray from \"the fear of the Lord.\" The vividness with which the ruin, bodily and moral, ensuing with absolute certainty on a life of vice, is described is a sufficient proof in itself that the subject before us is not brought forward from or for voluptuous motives, but for the purpose of conveying an impressive warning. Some commentators, e.g. Delitzsch, include the first six verses in the previous discourse; but the unity of the subject requires a different treatment. Zockler's reason against this arrangement, on the ground that the previous discourse was addressed to \"tender youth,\" and thus to youth in a state of pupilage, while the one before us refers to more advanced age - to the married man - may be true, but is not the true ground for incorporating them in the present discourse. The unity of the subject requires that they should be taken with the central and didactic part of the discourse, as being in a sense introductory to it. The discourse divides itself into three sections.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The earnest appeal to attention because of the counter-attraction in the blandishments of the harlot, which, however, in the end, are bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two-edged sword (vers. 1-6).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The main or didactic section (vers. 7-20), embracingNEWLINENEWLINE(a) warnings against adulterous intercourse with \"the strange woman\" (vers. 7-14);NEWLINENEWLINE(b) the antithetical admonition to use the means of chastity by remaining faithful to, and rejoicing with, the wife of one's youth (vers 15-20). AndNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the epilogue, which, in addition to the disastrous temporal consequences which follow on the violation of the sanctity of marriage, mentioned in vers. 9-14, represents the sin as one which will be examined by the universal Judge, and which brings with it its own Nemesis or retribution. All sins of impurity, all sins against temperance, soberness, and chastity, are no doubt involved in the warning, and the subject is capable of an allegorical interpretation - a mode of treatment in some instances adopted by the LXX. rendering, as that the \"strange woman\" stands as the representative of impenitence (Miller), or, according to the earlier view of Bede, as the representative of heresy and false doctrine; but the sin which is inveighed against, and which is made the subject of these repeated warnings, is not fornication simply, but adultery - the violation, in its most repulsive form, of the sacred obligations of marriage. The whole discourse is an impressive commentary on the seventh commandment. Verse 1. - The admonitory address is very similar to that in Proverbs 4:20, except that here the teacher says,\" Attend to my wisdom, bow down thine ear to my understanding,\" instead of \"Attend to my words, and incline thine ear unto my saying.\" It is not merely \"wisdom\" and \"understanding\" in the abstract, but wisdom which he has appropriated to himself, made his own, and which he knows by experience to be true wisdom. It may therefore have the sense of experience and observation, both of which increase with years. To \"bow down the ear\" is to listen attentively, and so to fix the mind intently on what is being said. Compare the similar expressions in Psalm 31:2 and Proverbs 2:2; Proverbs 4:20; 33:12. The same idea is expressed in Mare Antony's address to his countrymen, \"Lend me your ears\" (Shakespeare, 'Julius Caesar,' act 3. sc. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This verse expresses the purposes or results of the preceding admonition. The first is, that thou mayest regard discretion (Hebrew, lishmor m'zimmoth); literally, to guard reflection; i.e. in other words, that thou mayest maintain thoughtfulness, observe counsel, set a proper guard or control over thy thoughts, and so restrain them within proper and legitimate limits, or form such resolutions which, being well considered and prudential, may result in prudent conduct. The word m'zimmoth, however, does not travel beyond the sphere of what is conceived in the mind, and consequently does not mean conduct (as Holden conceives), except in a secondary sense, as that thoughts and plans are the necessary preliminaries to action and conduct. Muffet, in loc., explains, \"that thou mayest not conceive in mind any evil or vanity.\" The word m'zimmoth is the plural of m'zimmmah, which occurs in Proverbs 1:4. This word generally means any plan, project, device, either in a good or bad sense. In the latter sense it is applied to intrigue and deceitful conduct, as in Proverbs 24:8. It is here used in a good sense. Indeed, Delitzsch remarks that the use of the word in a good sense is peculiar to the introductory part of the Proverbs (ch. 1-9.). The Vulgate renders. \"That thou mayest guard thy thoughts or reflection (ut custodias cogitationes).\" So the LXX., Ἵνα φυλάξῃς ἔννοιαν ἀγαθήν, \"That thou mayest guard good reflection,\" the adjective ἀγαθή being introduced to note the sense in which the ἔννοια, i.e. act of thinking, properly, is to be understood. The prefix לִ (\"to\") before shamar, \"to guard,\" in lishmor, expresses the purpose, as in Proverbs 1:5; Proverbs 2:2, et alia. The second end in view is, that thy lips may keep knowledge; literally, and thy lips shall keep knowledge. Those lips keep or preserve knowledge which literally retain the instruction of Wisdom (Zockler), or which allow nothing to pass them which does not proceed from the knowledge of God (Delitzsch), and which, when they speak, give utterance to sound wisdom. The meaning may be illustrated by Psalm 17:3, \"I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.\" The same expression occurs in Malachi 2:7, \"For the priest's lips should keep knowledge,\" i.e. preserve and give utterance to it. Where \"the lips keep knowledge,\" there they are protected against the lips of the strange woman, i.e. against her allurements, because they will be fortified with purity. Thy lips; s'phatheyka is the dual of the feminine noun saphah, \"a lip.\" The teacher designedly uses this word instead of \"thy heart\" (cf. Proverbs 3:1), because of the contrast which he has in mind, and which be produces in the next verse. The LXX., Vulgate. and Arabic add, \"Attend not to the deceitful woman,\" which Houbigant and Schleusner think is required by the context. The addition, however, is without authority (Holden).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The teacher enters upon the subject of his warning, and under two familiar figures - common alike to Oriental and Greek writers - describes the nature of the \"strange woman's\" allurements. For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb. The conjunction \"for\" (Hebrew ki) here, like the LXX. γὰρ, states the reason why the preceding exhortation is worthy of attention. Some commentators render \"although,\" \"albeit,\" as corresponding with the antithetical \"but\" in ver. 4. The lips; siphthey, the construct case of saphah in ver. 2. The organ of speech is here used for the speech itself, like the parallel \"mouth.\" A strange woman (zarah); i.e. the harlot. The word occurs before in Proverbs 2:16, and again inch. 5:20; 7:5; 22:14; 23. 33. She is extranea, a stranger with respect to the youth whom she would beguile, either as being of foreign extraction, or as being the wife of another man, in which capacity she is so represented in Proverbs 7:19. In this sense she would be an adulteress. St. Jerome, in Ezekiel 6, takes her as the representative of the allurements from sound doctrine, and of corrupt worship (Wordsworth). Drop as an honeycomb (nopheth tithoph nah); rather, distil honey. The Hebrew nophteth is properly a \"dropping,\" distillatio, and so the honey flowing from the honeycombs (tsuphim). Kimchi explains it as the honey flowing from the cells before they are broken, and hence it is the pure fine virgin honey. Exactly the same phrase occurs in Song of Solomon 4:11, \"Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as an honeycomb (nopheth tithoph'nah).\" The only other places where we meet with the word nopheth are Psalm 24:10 (11) (there combined with tsuphim, which helps to determine its meaning) and Proverbs 24:13; Proverbs 27:7. The meaning is the same as she \"flattereth with her words\" of Proverbs 7:5, in which chapter the teacher gives an example of the alluring words which the strange woman uses (Proverbs 7:14-20). As honey is sweet and attractive to the taste, so in a higher degree are her words pleasant to the senses. Her mouth is smoother than oil; i.e. her words are most plausible and persuasive. The Hebrew khik is properly \"the palate,\" though it also included the corresponding lower part of the mouth (Gesenius). It is used as the instrument or organ of speech in Proverbs 8:7, \"For my mouth (khik) shall speak truth;\" and in Job 31:30, \"I have not suffered my mouth (khik) to sin.\" Under the same figure David describes the treachery of his friend in Psalm 55:22, \"His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The contrast is drawn with great vividness between the professions of the \"strange woman\" and the disastrous consequences which overtake those who listen to her enticements. She promises enjoyment, pleasure, freedom from danger, but her end is bitter as wormwood. \"Her end,\" not merely with reference to herself, which may be and is undoubtedly true, but the last of her as experienced by those who have intercourse with her - her character as it stands revealed at the last. So it is said of wine, \"At the last,\" i.e. its final effects, if indulged in to excess, \"it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder\" (Proverbs 23:22). Bitter as wormwood. The Hebrew, laanah, \"wormwood,\" Gesenius derives from the unused root laan, \"to curse.\" It is the equivalent to the absinthium of the Vulgate. So Aquila, who has ἀψίνθιον. The LXX. improperly renders χολή, \"gall.\" In other places the word laanah is used as the emblem of bitterness, with the superadded idea of its being poisonous, also according to the Hebrew notion, shared in also by the Greeks, that the plant combined these two qualities. Thus in Deuteronomy 29:18 it is associated with rosh, \"a poisonful herb\" (margin), and the Targum terms it, agreeably with this notion, \"deadly wormwood.\" The same belief is reproduced in Revelation 8:11, \"And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter\" (cf. Jeremiah 9:15; Amos 5:7: 6:12). The apostle, no doubt, has it in mind when he speaks of any \"root of bitterness,\" in Hebrews 12:15. The herb is thus described by Umbreit: \"It is a plant toward two feet high, belonging to the genus Artemisia (species Artemisia absinthium), which produces a very firm stalk with many branches, grayish leaves, and small, almost round, pendent blossoms. It has a bitter and saline taste, and seems to have been regarded in the East as also a poison, of which the frequent combination with rosh gives an intimation.\" Terence has a strikingly similar passage to the one before us -NEWLINENEWLINEIn melle sunt linguae sitae vestrae atque orationsNEWLINELacteque; corda felle sunt lita atque acerbo aceto.\" Your tongues are placed in honey and your speech is milk; your hearts are besmeared with gall and sharp vinegar ('Trucul.,' 1:11. 75). Sharp as a two-edged sword; literally, as a sword of edges (kherev piphiyyoth), which may mean a sword of extreme sharpness. Her end is as sharp as the sharpest sword. But it seems better to take the term as it is understood in the Authorized Version, which has the support both of the Vulgate, gladius biceps, and the LXX., μαχαίρα διστόμος, i.e. \"a two-edged sword.\" Compare \"a two-edged sword\" (kherev piphiyyoth) of Psalm 149:6. The meaning is, the last of her is poignancy of remorse, anguish of heart, and death. In these she involves her victims.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Vers. 5 and 6 continue the description of the harlot. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. She leads her victims to ruin. She hastens to death and the grove, and so do all those who listen to her. In all instances where the teacher speaks of the harlot at length he gives the same description of her (cf. Proverbs 2:18; Proverbs 7:27; Proverbs 9:18). An intensifying of the language is observable in the second hemistich. The descending progress to death becomes the laying hold of the grave, the underworld, as if nothing could turn her steps aside. And it is not only death, as the cessation of life, but death as a punishment, that is implied, just as the grave has in it the idea of corruption. (On \"hell,\" sh'ol, see Proverbs 1:12.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them. This verse should be rather rendered, she walks not in the path of life, her ways fiuctuate, she knows not. It consists of a series of independent proposiyions or statements, all of which are descriptive of the singularly fatuous conduct of \"the strange woman.\" In the previous verse the teacher has said that her conduct leads to ruin; he here further emphasizes the idea by putting forward the same truth from the opposite, or, as we may say, from the negative point of view, and so completes the picture. \"The words,\" as Plumptre remarks, \"describe with terrible vividness the state of heart and soul which prostitution brings on its victims.\" Her course is one o(persistent, wilful, headstrong, blind folly and wickedness. Lest; pen; here \"not,\" equivalent to לא (lo). So the LXX., Vulgate, Targum, Syriac. The use of pen, in this sense is, however, unique (Gesenius). Delitzsch and Zockler, following Luther, Geier, Holden, etc., assign to it an emphatic negative force, as, \"She is far removed from entering,\" or, \"she never treadeth.\" Others take pen as a dependent prohibitive particle, equivalent to the Latin ne forte, \"lest,\" as in the Authorized Version, and employed to connect the sentence which it introduces either with the preceding verse (as Schultens) or with the second hemistich, on which it is made dependent (Holden, Wordsworth, Aben Ezra, loc., Michaelis, etc.). Thou shouldest ponder; t'phalles, connected by makkeph with pen, as usual (Lee), is either second person masculine or third person feminine. The latter is required here, the subject of the sentence being \"the strange woman,\" as appears clearly from the second hemistich, \"her ways,\" etc. The verb patas (cf. Proverbs 14:26) here means \"to prepare,\" i.e. to walk in, or to travel over. Thus Gesenius renders, \"She (the adulteress) prepareth not (for herself) the way of life:\" i.e. she does not walk in the way of life; cf. the LXX. εἰσέρχεται, Vulgate ambulant (sc. gressus ejus), and other ancient versions, all of which understand the verb in this sense. The meaning of the phrase, pen t'phalles, is, therefore, \"she walks not\" in the way of life - the way that has life for its object, and which in itself is full of life and safety. Far from doing this, the teacher goes on to say, her ways are movable; literally, go to and fro, or fluctuate; i.e. they wilfully stagger hither and thither, like the steps of a drunkard, or like the uncertain steps of the blind, for the verb nua is so used in the former sense in Isaiah 24:20; Isaiah 29:9; Psalm 107:27; and in the latter in Lamentations 4:14. Her steps are slippery (LXX., σφαλέραι), or wander (Vulgate, vagi); they are without any definite aim; she is always straying in the vagrancy of sin (Wordsworth); cf. Proverbs 7:12. That thou canst not know them (lo theda); literally, she knows not. The elliptical form of this sentence in the original leaves it open to various interpretations. It seems to refer to the way of life; she knows not the way of life, i.e. she does not regard or perceive the way of life. The verb yada often has this meaning. The meaning may be obtained by supplying mah, equivalent to quicquam, \"anything,\" as in Proverbs 9:13, \"She knows not anything,\" i.e. she knows nothing. The objection to this is that it travels unnecessarily out of the sentence to find the object which ought rather to be supplied from the context. The object may possibly be the staggering of her feet: she staggers hither and thither without her perceiving it (Delitzsch); or it may, lastly, be indefinite: she knows not whittler her steps conduct her (Wordsworth and Zockler).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-14. - The ruinous consequences of indulgence in illicit pleasures. Verse 7. - The subject of which the teacher is heating demands the utmost attention of youth. Enough, it might be supposed, had been said to deter from intercourse with the \"strange woman.\" She has been portrayed in her real colours, plunging recklessly into ruin herself, and carrying her victims with her; deceitful, full of intrigues, neither walking in nor knowing the way of life. But the warning is amplified and made more impressive. There is another side of the picture, the complete bodily and temporal ruin of her victim. The argumentum ad hominem is applied. There is an appeal to personal interest in the details which follow, which ought not to fail in holding youth back. The form of the address which is repeated is very similar to that in Proverbs 7:24. The plural form, \"O ye children\" (cf. Proverbs 4:1 and Proverbs 7:24), immediately passes into the singular for the reason mentioned before, that, though the address is made to all, yet each individually is to apply it to himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Remove thy way far from her. In other words, this is the same as St. Paul counsels, \"Flee fornication\" (1 Corinthians 6:14). From her (mealeyah; desuper ea). The term conveys the impression that the youth has come within the compass of her temptations, or that in the highest degree he is liable to them. The Hebrew meal, compounded of min and al, and meaning\" from upon,\" being used of persons or things which go away from the place in or upon which they had been. And come not nigh the door of her house; i.e. shun the very place where she dwells. \"Be so far from coming into her chamber as not to come near the door of her house\" (Patrick). She and her house are to be avoided as if they were infected with some mortal disease. The old proverb quoted by Muffet is applicable -NEWLINENEWLINE\"He that would no evil doNEWLINEMust do nothing that 'longeth [i.e. belongeth] thereto.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The reasons why the harlot is to be avoided follow in rapid succession. Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel. The word rendered \"honour\" (Hebrew, hod) is not so much reputation, as the English implies, as \"the grace and freshness of youth.\" It is so used in Hosea 14:6; Daniel 10:8. The Vulgate renders \"honour,\" and the LXX., ζώη, \"life.\" Hod is derived from the Arabic word signifying \"to lift one's self up,\" and then \"to be eminent, beautiful.\" Thy years; i.e. the best and most vigorous, and hence the most useful and valuable, years of life. Unto the cruel (Hebrew, l'ak'zari); literally, to the cruel one; but the adjective akzari is only found in the singular, and may be here used in a collective sense as designating the entourage of the harlot, her associates who prey pitilessly on the youth whom they bring within the range of her fascinations. So Delitzsch. It seems to be so understood by the LXX., which reads ἀνελεήμοσιν, immitentibus; but not so by the Vulgate, which adheres to the singular, crudeli. If we adhere to the gender of the adjective akzari, which is masculine, and to its number, it may designate the husband of the adulteress, who will deal mercilessly towards the paramour of his wife. So Zockler. Again, it may refer, notwithstanding the gender, to the harlot herself (so Vatablus and Holden). who is cruel, who has no love for the youth, and would see him perish without pity. The explanation of Stuart and others, including Ewald, that the \"cruel one\" is the purchaser of the punished adulterer, is without foundation or warrant, since there is no historical instance on record where the adulterer was reduced to slavery, and the punishment inflicted by the Mosaic code was not slavery, but death (Numbers 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22), and, as it appears from Ezekiel 16:40 and John 8:5, death from stoning. The adjective akzari, like its equivalent akzar, is derived from the verb kazar, \"to break,\" and occurs again in Proverbs 11:17; Proverbs 12:10; Proverbs 17:11. The moral of the warning is a wasted life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Another temporal consequence of, and deterrent against, a life of profligacy. Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger. The margin reads, \"thy strength\" for \"thy wealth,\" but the text properly renders the original koakh, which means \"substance,\" \"wealth,\" \"riches\" - the youth's possessions in money and property (Delitzsch). The primary meaning of the word is \"strength\" or \"might,\" as appears from the verb kakhakh, \"to exert one's self,\" from which it is derived, but the parallel atsabeyka, \"thy toils,\" rendered \"thy labours,\" determines its use in the secondary sense here. Compare the similar passage in Hosea 7:9, \"Strangers have devoured his strength [koakh, i.e. ' his possessions'], and he knoweth it not\" (see also Job 6:22). Koakh is the concrete product resulting from the abstract strength or ability when brought into action. Thy labours (atsabeyka); i.e. thy toils, the product of laborious toil, that which you have gotten by the labour of your hands, and earned with the sweat of your brow. Fleischer compares the Italian i miri sudori, and the French mes sueurs. The singular etsev signifies \"heavy toilsome labour,\" and the plural (atsavim, \"labours,\" things done with toil, and so the idea passes to the resultant of the labour. Compare the very similar expression in Psalm 127:2, lekhem naatsavim, equivalent to \"bread obtained by toilsome labour;\" Authorized Version, \"the bread of sorrows.\" The Authorized Version properly supplies the verb \"be\" against those (e.g. Holden et alli) who join on \"thy labours\" to the previous verb \"be filled,\" as an accusative, and render, \"and with thy labours in the house of a stranger.\" So also the LXX. and the Vulgate, \"and thy labours come\" (ἕλθωσι, LXX.) or \"be\" (sint, Vulgate) \"to the house of strangers\" (εἰς οἴκους ἀλλοτρίων) or, \"in a strange house\" (in aliena domo). In the latter case the Vulgate is wrong, as nok'ri in the phrase beyth nok'ri is always personal (Delitzsch), and should be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, \"in the house of a stranger.\" The meaning of the verse is that a life of impurity transfers the profligate's substance, his wealth and possessions, to others, who will be satiated at his expense, and, being strangers, are indifferent to his ruin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The last argument is the mental anguish which ensues when health is ruined and wealth is squandered. And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. The Hebrew v'nahamta is rather \"and thou groan.\" It is not the plaintive wailing or the subdued grief of heart which is signified, but the loud wail of lamentation, the groaning indicative of intense mental suffering called forth by the remembrance of past folly, and which sees no remedy in the future. The verb naham occurs again in Proverbs 28:15, where it is used of the roaring of the lion, and the cognate noun naham is met with in Proverbs 19:12 and Proverbs 20:2 in the same sense. By Ezekiel it is used of the groaning of the people of Jerusalem when they shall see their sanctuary profaned, their sons and their daughters fall by the sword, and their city destroyed (Ezekiel 24:23). Isaiah (Isaiah 5:29, 30) applies it to the roaring of the sea. The Vulgate reproduces the idea in gemas, equivalent to \"and thou groan.\" The LXX. rendering, καὶ μεταμεληθήσῃ, \"and thou shelf repent,\" arising from the adoption of a different pointing, nikhamta, from the niph. nikham, \"to repent,\" for nahamta, to some extent expresses the sense. At the last; literally, at thine end; i.e. when thou art ruined, or, as the teacher explains, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. The expression, \"thy flesh and thy body,\" here stands for the whole body, the body in its totality, not the body and the soul, which would be different. Of these two words \"the flesh\" (basar) rather denotes the flesh in its strict sense as such (cf. Job 31:31; Job 33:21), while \"body\" (sh'er) is the flesh adhering to the bones. Gesenlus regards them as synonymous terms, stating, however, that sh'er is the more poetical as to use. The word basar is used to denote the whole body in ch. 14:30. It is clear that, by the use of these two terms here, the teacher is following a peculiarity observable elsewhere in the Proverbs, of combining two terms to express, and so to give force to, one idea. The expression describes \"the utter destruction of the libertine\" (Umbreit). This destruction, as further involving the ruin of the soul, is described in ch. 6:32, \"Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul (nephesh)\" (cf. Proverbs 7:22, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Self-reproach accompanies the unavailable groaning. And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof! i.e. how could it ever come to pass that I have acted in such a senseless and inexcusable manner, that I have hated instruction (musar, disciplina, παιδεία), the warning voice which dissuaded me from going with the harlot, and in my heart despised, i.e. rejected inwardly, whatever my outward demeanour may have been, the reproof which followed after I had been with her! Despised (naats), as in Proverbs 1:30; comp. also Proverbs 15:5, \"A fool despiseth his father's instructions.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me. The ruined profligate admits he was not without teachers and advisers, but that he gave no heed to their warnings and reproofs. Have not obeyed the voice (lo-shama'ti b'kol). The same phrase occurs in Genesis 27:13; Exodus 18:19; Deuteronomy 26:14; 2 Samuel 12:18. The verb shama is primarily \"to hear,\" and then \"to obey,\" \"to give heed to,\" like the Greek ἀκούω.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly; i.e. such was my shamelessness that there was scarcely any wickedness which I did not commit, unrestrained even by the presence of the congregation and assembly. The fact which the ruined youth laments is the extent and audacity of his sins. It is not that he accuses himself of hypocrisy in religion (Delitzsch), but he adds another clement in his career of vice. He has disregarded the warnings and reproofs of his teachers and friends; but more, the presence of the congregation of God's people, a silent but not a less impressive protest, had no restraining effect upon him. The words, \"the congregation and assembly\" (Hebrew, kahal v'edah), seem to be used to heighten the conception, rather than to express two distinct and separate ideas, since we find them both used interchangeably to designate the congregation of the Israelites. The radical conception of kahal (\"congregation\") is the same as that of the LXX. ἐκκλήσια and Vulgate ecclesia, viz. the congregation looked upon from the point of its being called together, kahal being derived from kahal, which in hiph. is equivalent to \"to call together,\" while that of edah is the congregation looked at from the point of its having assembled edah being derived from yaad, in niph. equivalent to \"to come together.\" The latter will therefore stand for any assembly of people specially convened or coming together for some definite object, like the LXX. συναγώγη and the Vulgate synagoga. The term edah is, however, used in a technical sense as signifying the seventy elders, or senators, who judged the people (see Numbers 25:7; Numbers 35:12). Rabbi Salomon so explains haedah as \"the congregation,\" in Joshua 20:6 and Numbers 27:21. Other explanations, however, have been given of these words. Zockler takes kahal as the convened council of elders acting as judges (Deuteronomy 33:4, 5), and edah as the concourse (coetus) of the people executing the condemning sentence (Numbers 15:15; cf. Psalm 7:7), and renders, \"Well nigh had I fallen into utter destruction in the midst of the assembly and the congregation.\" Fleischer, Vatablus, and Bayne take much the same view, looking upon ra (\"evil,\" Authorized Version) as \"punishment,\" i.e. the evil which follows as a consequence of sin - a usage supported by 2 Samuel 16:18; Exodus 5:19; 1 Chronicles 7:23; Psalm 10:6 - rather than as evil per se, i.e. that which is morally bad, as in Exodus 32:22. Aben Ezra considers that the perfect is used for the future; \"In a little time I shall be involved in all evil;\" i.e. punishment, which is looked forward to prospectively. For \"almost\" (ki-mat, equivalent to \"within a little,\" \"almost,\" \"nearly\"), see Genesis 26:10; Psalm 73:2; Psalm 119:87.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDrink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-19. - Commendation of the chaste intercourse of marriage. In this section the teacher passes from admonitory warnings against unchastity to the commendation of conjugal fidelity and pure love. The allegorical exposition of this passage, current at the period of the Revision of the Authorized Version in 1612, as referring to liberality, is not ad rem. Such an idea had no place certainly in the teacher's mind, nor is it appropriate to the context, the scope of which is, as we have seen, to warn youth against indulgence in illicit pleasures, by pointing out the terrible consequences which follow, and to indicate, on the other hand, in what direction the satisfaction of natural wants is to be obtained, that so, the heart and conscience being kept pure, sin and evil may be avoided. Verse 15. - Drink waters out of thine own cistern, etc.; i.e. in the wife of your own choice, or in the legitimate sphere of marriage, seek the satisfaction of your natural impulses. The pure, innocent, and chaste nature of such pleasures is appropriately compared with the pure and wholesome waters of the cistern and the wellspring. The \"drinking\" carries with it the satisfying of a natural want. Agreeably with oriental and scriptural usage, \"the wife\" is compared with a \"cistern\" and \"well.\" Thus in the Song of Solomon the \"bride\" is called a spring shut up, a fountain sealed\" (Song of Solomon 4:12). Sarah is spoken of under exactly the same figure that is used here, viz. the bor, or \"cistern,\" in Isaiah 51:1. The figure was not confined to women, however, as we find Judah alluded to as \"waters\" in Isaiah 48:1, and Jacob or Israel so appearing in the prophecy of Balaam (Numbers 24:7). The people are spoken of by David as they that are \"of the fountain of Israel\" (Psalm 68:26). A similar imagery is employed in the New Testament of the wife. The apostles St. Paul and St. Peter both speak of her as \"the vessel (τὸ σκεῦος)\" (see 1 Thessalonians 4:4 and 1 Peter 3:7). The forms of the original, b'or and b'er, standing respectively for \"cistern\" and \"well,\" indicate a common derivation from baar, \"to dig.\" But bor is an artificially constructed reservoir or cistern, equivalent to the Vulgate cisterna, and LXX. ἄγγειος, while b'er is the natural spring of water, equivalent to the Vulgate putens. So Aben Ezra, who says, on Leviticus 2:36, \"Bor is that which catches the rain, while b'er is that from within which the water wells up.\" This explanation, however, does not entirely cover the terms as used here. The \"waters\" (Hebrew, mayim) may be the pure water conveyed into the cistern, and not simply the water which is caught in its descent born heaven. The parallel term, \"running waters\" (Hebrew, noz'lim), describes the flowing limpid stream fit, like the other, for drinking purposes. A similar use of the terms is made in the Song of Solomon 4:15, \"a well of living waters (b'er mayim khayyim) and streams (v'noz'lim) from Lebanon.\" It may be remarked that the allusion to the wife, under the figures employed, enhances her value. It indicates the high estimation in which she is to be held, since the \"cistern\" or \"well\" was one of the most valuable possessions and adjuncts of an Eastern house. The teaching of the passage, in its bearing on the subject of marriage, coincides with that which is subsequently put forward by St. Paul, in 1 Corinthians 7:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. The figurative language is still continued, and under the terms \"fountains\" and \"rivers of waters,\" are to be understood children, the legitimate issue of lawful marriage. So Aben Ezra and the majority of modern commentators, Schultens, Doderlein, Holden, Muenscher, Noyes, Wardlaw, etc. The meaning appears to be, \"Let thy marriage be blessed with many children, who may go forth abroad for the public good.\" Other interpretations have been adopted. Thus:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Delitzsch takes the words fountans and \"rivers of waters\" as used figuratively for the procreative power, and renders, \"Shall thy streams flow abroad, and water brooks in the streets?\" and interprets, \"Let generative power act freely and unrestrainedly within the marriage relation.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Schultens and Dathe, followed by Holden, regard the verse as expressing a conclusion on the preceding, \"Then shall thy springs be dispersed abroad, even rivers of waters in the streets.\" The objection to this is that it necessitates the insertion of the copulative vau (ו) before the verb, yaphutzu, \"be dispersed.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Zockler and Hitzig read the verse interrogatively, \"Shall thy streams flow abroad as water brooks in the streets?\" on the analogy of Proverbs 6:30 and Psalm 56:7.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The reading of the LXX., adopted by Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, places a negative before the verb, Μὴ ὑπερεκχείσθω, i.e. \"Let not thy waters flow beyond thy fountain;\" i.e. \"confine thyself to thy wife.\" Fountains. The Hebrew ma'yanim, plural of mayan, derived from ayin (\"a fountain\") with the formative men, is rather a stream or rill - water flowing on the surface of the ground. It is used, however, of a fountain itself in Genesis 7:11; Genesis 8:2. Rivers of waters (Hebrew, pal'gey-mayim); rather, water courses, or water brooks (cf. Job 38:25). The peleg represents the various streams into which the mayan, \"fountain,\" divides itself at its source or in its course. We find the same expression, pal'gey-mayim, used of tears in Psalm 119:136; Lamentations 3:48. It occurs again in our book in Proverbs 21:1, \"The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of waters (pal'gey mayim).\" On \"abroad\" (Hebrew, khutz), and \"in the streets\" (r'khovoth), see Proverbs 1:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. By confining yourself to chaste intercourse with your lawful wife, be assured that your offspring is your own. Promiscuous and unlawful intercourse throws doubt upon the paternity of children. Thy children may be thine, they may belong to another. The natural pride which is felt in a legitimate offspring is the motive put forward to commend the husband to confine himself exclusively to his wife. Grotius on this verse remarks, \"Ibi sere ubi prolem metas\" - \"Sow there where you may reap an offspring.\" Them; i.e. the children referred to figuratively in the preceding verse, from which the subject of this verse is supplied. The repetition of the pronoun which occurs in the original, \"let them belong to thee, to thee,\" is emphatic, and exclusive of others. The latter clause of the verse, \"and not strangers' with thee,\" covers the whole ground. The idea of their being strangers' is repulsive, and so gives further point to the exhortation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. The employment of the ordinary term \"wife\" in the second hemistich shows in what sense the figure which is used has to be understood. The terms \"fountain\" and \"wife\" denote the same person. The wife is here called \"thy fountain\" (Hebrew, m'kor'ka), just as she has been previously \"thine own cistern\" (b'or) and \"thine own well\" (b'er) in ver. 15. The Hebrew makor, \"fountain,\" is derived from the root kur, \"to dig.\" The figure seems to determine that the blessing here spoken of consists in the with being a fruitful mother of children; and hence the phrase means, \"Let thy with be blessed,\" i.e. rendered happy in being the mother of thy children. This is quite consistent with the Hebrew mode of thought. Every Israelitish wife regarded herself, and was regarded by ethers as \"blessed,\" if she bore children, and unhappy if the reverse were the case. Blessed; Hebrew, baruk (Vulgate, benedicta), is the kal participle passive of barak, \"to bless.\" Instead of this, the LXX. reads ἴδια, \"Let thy fountain be thine own\" - a variation which in no sense conveys the meaning of the original. And rejoice with; rather, rejoice in, the wife being regarded as the sphere within which the husband is to find his pleasure and joy. Umbreit explains, \"Let thy wife be extolled.\" The same construction of the imperative s'makh, from samakh,\" to be glad, or joyful,\" with min, occurs in Judges 9:19; Zephaniah 3:14, etc. The Authorized rendering is, however, favoured by the Vulgate, laetare cum, and the LXX., συνευφραίνω μετὰ Compare the exhortation in Ecclesiastes 9:9, \"Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest.\" The wife of thy youth (Hebrew, ishshah n'ureyka) may mean eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the wife to whom thou hast given the fair bloom of thy youth (Umbreit);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the wife chosen in thy youth (Delitzsch); orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) thy youthful wife. The former seems the more probable meaning. Compare the expression, \"companion of thy youth,\" in Proverbs 2:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe. The words in italics do not occur in the original. The expression, \"the loving hind and pleasant roe,\" is, therefore, to be attached to the preceding verse, as carrying on the sense and as descriptive of the grace and fascinating charms of the young wife. As combining these attributes, she is to be the object of thy love and devotion,the one in whom thine affections are to find the fulfilment of their desires. Love and grace are her possessions. The loving hind (Hebrew, ayyeleth ahavim); literally, the hind of loves, which may be understood, as in the Authorized Version, as pointing to the fondness of this animal for its young, or as descriptive of its beauty and the extreme gracefulness of its form. In this sense the phrase may be rendered, \"the lovely hind.\" The ayyeleth, or ayyalah, feminine of ayyal, \"stag,\" or \"hart,\" was in all probability the gazelle, Pleasant roe (Hebrew, yhaalath khen); literally, the ibex of grace. The particular expression only occurs here in the Bible. The yaalath is the feminine of yaal, \"the ibex\" or \"mountain goat\" according to Bochart, or the \"chamois\" according to Gesenius. It does not appear that it is so much \"the pleasantness\" or amiability of this animal which is here alluded to as its gracefulness of form. As terms of endearment, the words entered largely into the erotic poetry of the East. Thus in the Song of Solomon 4:5 the bride likens her beloved to \"a roe or young hart\" (cf. also Song of Solomon 4:17 and Song 8:14). while numerous examples might be quoted from the Arabian and Persian poets. They were also employed sometimes as names for women. Compare the superscription of Psalm 22, Ayyeleth hash-shakar, \"Upon the hind of the dawn.\" Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times. The love of the wife is to refresh and fully satisfy the husband. The word dadeyah, \"her breasts,\" only occurs here and in Ezekiel 23:3, 8, 21, and is equivalent to dodeyah, \"her love.\" The marginal reading, \"water thee,\" serves to bring out the literal meaning of the y'ravvuka, derived from ravah, in kal, \"to drink largely,\" \"to be satisfied with drink,\" but misses the emphatic force of the piel, \"to be fully satisfied or satiated.\" This is expressed very forcibly in the Vulgate rendering, \"Let her breasts inebriate thee (indebrient te),\" which represents the strong influence which the attractions of the wife are to maintain. The LXX., on the other hand, avoiding the rather sensual colouring of the language, substitutes, \"May she thine own lead thee, and be with thee always.\" And be thou ravished always with her love; i.e. let it intoxicate thee. The teacher, by a bold figure, describes the entire fascination which the husband is to allow the wife to exercise over him. The verb shagah is \"to reel under the influence of wine,\" and is so used in the succeeding vers. 20 and 23, and Proverbs 20:1 and Isaiah 28:7. The primary meaning, \"to err from the way,\" scarcely applies here, and does not express the idea of the teacher, which is to describe \"an intensity of love connected with the feeling of superabundant happiness\" (Delitzsch). The Vulgate, In amore ejus delectare jugiter, \"In her love delight thyself continually,\" and the LXX., \"For in her love thou shalt be daily engaged,\" are mere paraphrases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - The adulterer to be restrained by the fact of God's omniscience and the Divine punishment. Vers. 20 and 21 should apparently be taken together. The teaching assumes a higher tone, and rises from the lower law which regulates fidelity to the wife, based upon personal attractions, to the higher law, which brings the husband's conduct into relation with the duty he owes to Jehovah. Not merely is his conduct to be regulated by love and affection alone, but it is to be fashioned by the reflection or consciousness that the Supreme Being presides over all, and takes cognizance of human action. Without losing sight that the marriage contract has its own peculiar obligations, the fact is insisted upon that all a man's ways are open to the eyes of the Lord. Verse 20. - And why; i.e. what inducement is there, what reason can be given, for conjugal infidelity, except the lewd and immoral promptings of the lower nature, except sensuality in its lowest form? Ravished. The verb shagah recurs, but in a lower sense, as indicating \"the foolish delirium of the libertine hastening after the harlot\" (Zockler). With a strange woman (Hebrew, b'zarah); i.e. with a harlot. On zarah, see Proverbs 2:16 and Proverbs 7:5. The b' (בְּ) localizes the sources of the intoxication. Embrace (Hebrew, t'khab-bek). On this verb, see Proverbs 4:8. The bosom of a stranger (Hebrew, kheh nok'riyyah). A parallel expression having the same force as its counterpart. The more usual form of khek is kheyk, and means \"the bosom\" of a person. In Proverbs 16:33 it is used of the lap, and in Proverbs 17:23 and Proverbs 21:14 for the bosom or folds of a garment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord. The obvious meaning here is that as \"the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good\" (Proverbs 15:3), there is no possibility of any act of immorality escaping God's notice. The consciousness of this fact is to be the restraining motive, inasmuch as he who sees will also punish every transgression. The great truth acknowledged here is the omniscience of God, a truth which is borne witness to in almost identical language in Job: \"For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings\" (Job 34:21; cf. 24:23 and Job 31:4). So Hanani the seer says to Asa King of Judah, \"For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth\" (2 Chronicles 16:9); and Jehovah says, in Jeremiah, \"For mine eyes are upon all their ways, they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes\" (Jeremiah 16:17; cf. 32:29); and again, in Hosea, \"They are before my face\" (Hosea 7:2), and the same truth is re-echoed in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in all probability gathered from our passage, \"All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do\" (Hebrews 4:13). The ways of man; i.e. the conduct of any individual man or woman; ish, \"man,\" being used generically. Are before the eyes of the Lord; i.e. are an object on which Jehovah fixes his gaze and scrutiny. And he pondereth all his goings. The word \"he pondereth\" is in the original m'phalles, the piel participle of philles, piel of the unused kal, palas, and appears to be properly rendered in the Authorized Version. This verb, however, has various meanings:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) to make level, or prepare, as in Proverbs 4:26 and Proverbs 5:6;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to weigh, or consider accurately, in which sense it is used here.NEWLINENEWLINESo Gesenius, Lee, Buxtorf, and Davidson. Jehovah not only sees, but weighs all that a man does, wheresoever he be, and will apportion rewards and punishments according to a man's actions (Patrick). The German commentators, Delitzsch and Zockler, however, look upon the word as indicating the overruling providence of God, just as the former part of the verse refers to his omniscience, and render, \"he marketh out,\" in the sense that the Lord makes it possible for a man to walk in the way of uprightness and purity. There is nothing inherently objectionable in this view, since experience shows that the world is regulated by the Divine government, but it loses sight to some extent of the truth upon which the teacher appears to be insisting, which is that evil actions are visited with Divine retribution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - The fearful end of the adulterer. From the universal statement of God's omniscience and the Divine judgment, the teacher passes to the fate of the profligate. His end is inevitable ruin and misery. The deep moral lesson conveyed is that sin carries with it its own Nemesis. Adultery and impurity, like all sin of which they are forms, are retributive. The career of the adulterer is a career begun, continued, and ended in folly (comp. Proverbs 1:31, 32; Proverbs 2:5; Proverbs 18:7; Proverbs 29:6; and Psalm 9:15). Verse 22. - His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself; i.e. his manifold sins shall overtake and arrest him. The imagery is borrowed from the snare of the fowler. The emphatic form of the original, \"His sins shall overtake him, the impious man,\" point conclusively to the adulterer. It is \"his\" sins that shall overtake him, not those of another, and they shall fall upon his own head; and further, his character is depicted in the condemning clause, \"the impious man;\" for such he is. Shall take. The verb lakad is literally \"to take or catch animals in a snare or net,\" properly \"to strike with a net.\" The wicked man becomes entangled and caught in his own sins; he is struck down and captured by them, just as the prey is struck by the snare of the fowler. The verb is, of course, used metaphorically, as in Job 5:13. The wicked (Hebrew, eth-harasa); in the original introduced as explanatory of the object, \"him.\" And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. The Authorized Version follows the LXX. and Vulgate in rendering \"his sins,\" instead of the original \"his sin\" (khattatho). It is not so much every sin of man which shall hold him, though this is true, as the particular sin treated of in the address, viz. adultery, which shall do this. The expression, \"the cords of his sin\" (Hebrew, khavley khattatho), means the cords which his sin weaves around him. Nothing else will be requisite to bind and hold him fast for punishment (cf. \"cords of vanity,\" in Isaiah 5:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He shall die without instruction. The phrase, \"without instruction,\" is in the original b'eyu musar, literally, \"in there not being instruction.\" The obvious meaning is, because he gave no heed to instruction. So Aben Ezra and Gersom. The Authorized Version is at least ambiguous, and seems to imply that the adulterer has been without instruction, without any to reprove or counsel him. But such is not the case. He has been admonished of the evil consequences of his sin, but to these warnings he has turned a deaf ear, and the teacher says therefore he shall die. The Vulgate supports this explanation, quia non habuit disciplinam \"because he did not entertain or use instruction.\" In the LXX. the idea is enlarged, \"He shall die together with these who have no instruction (μετὰ ἀπαιδεύτων).\" The b' (בְּ) in b'eyn is causal, and equivalent to propter, as in Genesis 18:28; Jeremiah 17:3. A similar statement is found in Job 4:21, \"They die even without wisdom,\" i.e. because they have disregarded the lessons of wisdom; and Job 36:12, \"They shall die without knowledge.\" And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray; better, as Delitzsch, \"He shall stagger to ruin.\" The verb shagah is used as in vers. 19 and 20, but with a deeper and more dread significance. A climax is reached in the manner in which the end of the adulterer is portrayed. His end is without a gleam of hope or satisfaction. With an understanding darkened and rendered callous by unrestrained indulgence in lust, and by folly which has reached its utmost limits and cannot, as it were, be surpassed, in that it has persistently and wilfully set aside and scorned wisdom and true happiness, the adulterer, like the drunkard, who is oblivious of the danger before him, shall stagger to ruin.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-35. - The sixth chapter embraces four distinct discourses, each of which is a warning. The subjects treated of areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) suretyship (vers. 1-5);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) sloth (vers. 6-11);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) malice (vers. 12-19); andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) adultery (ver. 20 to the end).NEWLINENEWLINEThe continuity of the subject treated of in the preceding chapter appears to be somewhat abruptly interrupted to make way for the insertion of three discourses on subjects which apparently have little connection with what precedes and what follows. Their unlooked for and unexpected appearance has led Hitzig to regard them as interpolations, but it has been conclusively pointed out by Delitzsch that there is sufficient internal evidence, in the grammatical construction, figures, word formations, delineations, and threatenings, to establish the position that they proceeded from the same hand that composed the rest of the book and to guarantee their genuineness. But another and not less interesting question arises as to whether any connection subsists between these discourses and the subject which they apparently interrupt. Such a connection is altogether denied by Delitzsch, Zockler, and other German commentators, who look upon them as independent discourses, and maintain that, if there is any connection, it can be only external and accidental. On the other hand, Bishops Patrick and Wordsworth discover an ethical connection which, though not clear at first sight, is not on that account less real or true. The subject treated of in the preceding chapter is the happiness of the married life, and this is imperilled by incautious undertaking of suretyship, and suretyship, it is maintained, induces sloth, while sloth leads to maliciousness After treating of suretyship, sloth, and malice in succession, the teacher recurs to the former subject of his discourse, viz. impurity of life, against which he gives impressive warnings. That such is the true view them appears little doubt. One vice is intimately connected with another, and the verdict of experience is that a life of idleness is one of the most prolific sources of a life of impurity. Hence we find Ovid saying -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Quaeritur, AEgisthus, qua re sit factus adulter?NEWLINEIn promptu causa est - desidiosus erat.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Do you ask why AEgisthus has become an adulterer?NEWLINEThe reason is close at hand - he was full of idleness.\" Within the sphere of these discourses them. selves the internal connection is distinctly observable, vers. 16-19 being a refrain of vers. 12-15, and the phrase, \"to stir up strife,\" closing each enumeration (see vers. 14 and 19). Verses 1-5. - 9. Ninth admonitory discourse. Warning against suretyship. Verse 1. - The contents of this section are not to be taken so much as an absolute unqualified prohibition of suretyship as counsel directed against the inconsiderate and rash undertaking of such an obligation. There were some occasions on which becoming surety for another was demanded by the laws of charity and prudence, and when it was not inconsistent with the humane precepts of the Mosaic Law as enunciated in Leviticus 19:19. In other passages of our book the writer of the Proverbs lays down maxims which would clearly countenance the practice (Proverbs 14:21; Proverbs 17:17; Proverbs 18:24; Proverbs 27:10), and in the apocryphal writings the practice is encouraged, if not enjoined (Ecclus. 29:14 Ecclus. 8:13). Notwithstanding this limitation, however, it is observable that suretyship is almost invariably spoken of in terms of condemnation, and the evil consequences which it entailed on the surety may be the reason why it is so frequently alluded to. The teacher refers to the subject in the following passages: here; Proverbs 11:15: 17:18; 22:26; 20:16; 27:13. My son. On this address, see Proverbs 2:1; Proverbs 3:1, 17. If thou be surety (Hebrew, im-aravta); literally, if thou hast become surety; LXX., ἐάν ἐγγύσῃ; Vulgate, si spoponderis. What the teacher counsels in the present instance is that, if by inadvertence a person has become surety, he should by the most strenuous endeavours prevail on his friend to free him from the bond. The Hebrew verb arav is properly \"to mix,\" and then signifies \"to become surety\" in the sense of interchanging with another and so taking his place. The frequent mention of suretyship in the Proverbs is alluded to above. The first recorded instances are those where Judah offers to become surety for Benjamin, first to Israel (Genesis 43:9), and secondly to Joseph (Genesis 44:33). It is singular that it is only once alluded to in the Book of Job, where Job says, \"Lay down now, put me in surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?\" (Job 17:3); and once only, and that doubtfully, in the whole of the Mosaic writings, in the phrase tesummat yad, i.e. giving or striking the hand in the case of perjury (Leviticus 6:2). The psalmist refers to it in the words, \"Be surety for thy servant for good\" (Psalm 119:122). It is spoken of twice in Isaiah (Isaiah 38:14; Isaiah 36:8), once in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:27) and in Nehemiah (Nehemiah 5:3), and the cognate noun, arrabon, \"the pledge,\" security for payment, is met with in Genesis 38:17 and 1 Samuel 17:18. These scattered notices in the Old Testament show that the practice was always in existence, while the more frequent notices in the Proverbs refer to a condition of society where extended commercial transactions had apparently made it a thing of daily occurrence, and a source of constant danger. In the New Testament one instance of suretyship is found, when St. Paul offers to become surety to Philemon for Onesimus (Philemon 1:19). But in the language of the New Testament, the purely commercial meaning of the word is transmuted into a spiritual one. The gift of the Spirit is regarded as the arrabon, ὀρραβὼν, \"the pledge,\" the earnest of the Christian believer's acceptance with God (2 Corinthians 1:22; 2 Corinthians 5:5; Ephesians 1:14). For thy friend; Hebrew, l'reeka. The Hebrew reeh, more usually rea, is \"the companion or friend,\" and in this case obviously the debtor for whom one has become surety. The word reappears in ver. 3. The לְ (l) prefixed to reeh is the dativus commodi. So Delitzsch and others. If not in the original, but rightly inserted. Thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger (Hebrew, taka'ta lazzar kapeyka); properly, thou hast stricken thy hand for a stranger. The analogous use of l' (לְ) in lazzar determines this rendering. As in the corresponding l'reeyka, the לְ (l) indicates the person for whose benefit the suretyship is undertaken, i.e. the debtor, and not the person with whom the symbolical act is performed, i.e. the creditor. Compare the following passages, though the construction with לְ is wanting: \"He that is surety for a stranger\" (Proverbs 11:15); \"Take his garment that is surety for a stranger\" (Proverbs 20:16 and Proverbs 27:13). \"The stranger,\" zar, is not an alien, or one belonging to another nationality, but simply one extraneous to one's self, and so equivalent to akher, \"another.\" The meaning, therefore, seems to be, \"If thou hast entered into a bond for one with whom thou art but slightly acquainted.\" Others (Wordsworth, Plumptre), however, take zar as representing the foreign money lender. The phrase, \"to strike the hand,\" taka kaph, or simply \"to strike,\" taka, describes the symbolical act which accompanied the contract. Taka is properly \"to drive,\" like the Latin defigere, and hence \"to strike,\" and indicates the sharp sound with which the hands were brought into contact. The act no doubt was accomplished before witnesses, and the hand which was stricken was that of the creditor, who thereby received assurance that the responsibility of the debtor was undertaken by the surety. The \"striking of the hand\" as indicating the completion of a contract is illustrated by the author of the 'Kamoos' (quoted by Lee, on Job 17:3), who says, \"He struck or clapped to him a sale... he struck his hand in a sale, or on his hand... he struck his ow hand upon the hand of him, and this is among the necessary (transactions) of sale.\" So among Western nations the giving of the band has been always regarded as a pledge of bona fides. Thus Menelaus demands of Helena (Euripides, 'Hel.,' 838), Ἐπὶ τοῖσδε νῦν δεξιὰς ἐμῆς θίγε, \"Touch my right hand now on these conditions,\" i.e. in attestation that you accept them. In purely verbal agreements it is the custom in the present day for the parties to clasp the hand. A further example may be found in the plighting of troth in the Marriage Service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou art snared with the words of thy month, etc.; i.e. the inevitable consequence of an inconsiderate undertaking of suretyship is that you become entangled and involved by your own premises, and hampered by self-imposed obligations. The Authorized Version rightly regards this as the conclusion. So the Vulgate. Others, however, carry on the hypothesis, and insert im, \"if:\" \"If thou art snared,\" etc.; but without warrant (Zockler, Wordsworth, Plumptre). The LXX. throws the thought into the form of a proverb, as \"a strong net to a man are his own words.\" A distinction is to be drawn between the verbs rendered \"entangled\" and \"taken;\" the former, yakosh, signifying to be taken unwarily, off one's guard; the latter, lakad, referring, as before observed (cf. Proverbs 5:22), to the being stricken with the net. They are found in the same collocation in Isaiah 8:15, \"Many among them shall be snared and taken.\" The repetition of the phrase, \"with the words of thy mouth,\" is not unintentional or purely rhetorical. It is made, as Delitzsch observes, to bring with greater force to the mind that the entanglements in which the surety is involved are the result of his own indiscretion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - In this verse advice is tendered as to what is to be done under the circumstances of this entanglement. The surety is to take immediate steps to be set free. The urgency of the advice is to be explained by the serious consequences which would follow in the event of the debtor not satisfying the creditor in due time. The surety became liable to the penalties inflicted by the Hebrew law of debt. His property could be distrained. His bed and his garment could be taken from him (Proverbs 22:27 and Proverbs 20:16), and he was liable as well as his family to be reduced to the condition of servitude. So we find the son of Sirach saying, \"Suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations\" (Ecclus. 29:18; cf. 2 Kings 4:1; Nehemiah 5:3-5; and Matthew 18:25). Compare the dictum of Thales, the Greek philosopher, Ἐγγύα πάρα δ ἄτα, \"Give surety, and ruin is near;\" and that of Chilo (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 6:32), \"Sponsioni non deest jactura\" - \"Loss is not wanting to a surety.\" The same idea is conveyed in the modern German proverb, \"Burgen soll man wurgen\" - \"Worry a surety\" Do this now; or, therefore. The particle epho is intensive, and emphasizes the command, and in this sense is of frequent occurrence (Job 17:15; Genesis 27:32; Genesis 43:11; 2 Kings 10:10, etc.). It appears to be equivalent to the Latin quod dico. So the Vulgate, \"Do therefore what I say;\" similarly the LXX. renders, \"Do, my son, what I bid thee (α{ ἐγὼ σοι ἐντέλλομαι).\" It carries with it the sense of instant and prompt action. And deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; i.e. set thyself free when thou findest thou art actually at the mercy of thy friend for whom thou hast become surety. The ki (כִּי) is not hypothetical, but actual; it is not \"if\" you are, but \"when\" or because you actually are in his power. The Vulgate and LXX. render כִּי respectively by quia and γὰρ. Go, humble thyself; i.e. present thyself as a suppliant, prostrate thyself, offer thyself to be trodden upon (Michaelis), or humble thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon (Rashi). or humble thyself under the soles of his feet (Aben Ezra). The expression implies the spirit of entire submission, in which the surety is to approach his friend in order to be released from his responsibility. The Hebrew verb hith'rappes has, however, been rendered differently. Radically raphas signifies \"to tread or trample with the feet,\" and this has been taken to express haste, or the bestirring of one's self. So the Vulgate reads festina, \"hasten;\" and the LXX. ἴσθι μὴ ἐκλυόμενος, i.e. \"be not remiss.\" But the hithp, clearly determines in favour of the reflexive rendering; comp. Psalm 68:30, \"Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver\" - the only other passage where raphas occurs. And make sure thy friend (Hebrew, r'hav reeyka); rather, importune thy friend, be urgent with him, press upon him to fulfil his engagement. The verb rahav is properly \"to be fierce,\" \"to rage,\" and hence with the accusative, as here, \"to assail with impetuosity.\" In Isaiah 3:5 it is used with בְּ (b), and signifies to act fiercely against any one. The meaning of the passage is that if abject submission or persuasion does not avail, then sterner measures are to be resorted to to gain the desired end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - This verse carries on the thought one step further. The appeal to the friend is not to be confined to one spasmodic effort and then relinquished. He is to be followed up pertinaciously and continually, with unwearied diligence, until prevailed upon to fulfil his engagements. Of this unwearied energy in the pursuit of an object in which cue is deeply interested, compare David's resolution, \"I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob\" (Psalm 132:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The struggles of the roe and the bird to escape from the snare are employed figuratively to describe the efforts which the surety is to make to tear and free himself from his friend. From the hand of the hunter (Hebrew, miyyad); literally, from the hand, as shown by the italics. The variation in all the ancient versions, with the exception of the Vulgate and Venetian, which read \"from the snare,\" suggests that the original text was mippath instead of miyyad. The Hebrew yad, \"hand,\" may, however, be used by metonymy for a toil or gin; but this is improbable, as no example of this kind can be found. With regard to the addition, \"of the hunter,\" though this does not occur in the original, the parallelism would seem to clearly require it, and Bottcher maintains, but upon insufficient evidence, and against the reading of all manuscripts, which omit it, that the word tsayyad, equivalent to \"of the hunter,\" formed part of the original text, but has fallen out. The plain reading, \"from the hand,\" may, however, be used absolutely, as in 1 Kings 20:42, \"Because thou hast let go out of thy hand (miyyad),\" in which case the hand will not be that of the hunter, but that of the person for whom the one is surety. Roe. There is a paronomasia in ts'vi, equivalent to \"roe,\" and tsiphor, equivalent to \"bird,\" of the original, which is lost in the Authorized Version. The ts'vi is the \"roe\" or \"gazelle,\" so named from the beauty of its form (see also Song of Solomon 2:7-9, 17; Song of Solomon 3:5; Song of Solomon 8:14; 1 Kings 5:3; Isaiah 13:14). Tsippor is a generic word, and represents any small bird. It is derived from the twittering or chirping noise which the bird makes, the root being tsaphar, \"to chirp, or twitter.\" As to its identification with the sparrow, Passer montanus, or the blue thrush, Petrocossyphus cyanens (see 'Bible Animals,' Rev. J.G. Wood, p. 405, edit. 1876).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-11. - 10. Tenth admonitory discourse. Warning against sloth. The ethical connection of this discourse with the preceding has already been pointed out. Sloth militates against prosperity; it is the prolific parent of want, and, even more surely than suretyship, leads to misfortune and ruin, The certainty with which ruin steals upon the sluggard may be the reason why the teacher closes the discourse in the way he does. In the case of suretyship such an issue is uncertain; there is the possibility of escape, the surety may prevail upon his friend to release him from his obligation, and so he may escape ruin; but with sloth no such contingency is possible, its invariable end is disaster. So far as the grammatical structure of the two discourses is concerned, they appear to be quite independent of each other, the only points of coincidence observable being the repetition of one or two words, which is purely accidental (cf. \"go\" in vers. 3 and 6, and \"sleep\" and \"slumber\" in vers. 4 and 10). Verse 6. - Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. The ant (Hebrew, n'malah) is here brought forward as supplying an example of wisdom to the sluggard. The habits of this insect, its industry and providence, have in all ages made it the symbol of these two qualities, and not only the sacred, but also profane writers have praised its foresight, and held it up for imitation. The ant is only mentioned twice in the Old Testament, and on both occasions in our book (see present passage and Proverbs 30:25). The derivation of n'malah is either from the root nam, with reference first to the silence with which it moves, and secondly to its active yet unperceived motion (Delitzsch), or from namal, i.q. malal, \"to cut off,\" from its cutting off or consuming seeds (ab incidendis seminibus) (Buxtorf, Gesenius). The Aramaic name, shum'sh'manah, however, points to its activity and rapid running hither and thither (Fleischer). Sluggard; Hebrew, atsel, a verbal adjective tbund only in the Proverbs. The primary idea of the root atsal is that of languor and laxity. The cognate abstract nouns ats'lah and ats'luth, equivalent to \"slothfulness,\" occur in Proverbs 19:15; Proverbs 31:27. Consider her ways; attentively regard them, and from them derive a lesson of wisdom. Her ways are the manner in which the ant displays her industry and foresight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich having no guide, overseer, or ruler,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler. This statement is substantially correct, for though the most recent observations made by modern naturalists have discovered various classes of ants occupying the same ant hill, yet there appears to be a total want of that gradation and subordination in ant life which is noticeable among bees. The three terms used here, katsa, shoter, moshel, all refer to government, and correspond respectively with the modern, Arabic terms, kadi, wall, and emir (Zockler). The first refers to the judicial office, and should rather be rendered \"judge,\" the root katsah being \"to decide\" (see Isaiah 1:10; Isaiah 3:6, 7; Micah 3:9). The word, however, is used of a military commander in Joshua 10:24; Judges 2:6-11, and in this sense it is understood by the Vulgate, which has dux. Shoter, rendered \"overseer,\" is literally \"a scribe,\" and appears as the general designation for any official In Exodus 5:6, 19 the shoter is the person employed by the Egyptian taskmasters to urge on the Israelites in their forced labour; in Numbers 11:16 the shoter is one of the seventy elders; and in 1 Chronicles 23:4 he is a municipal magistrate. The meaning assigned to the word in the Authorized Version seems to be the correct one. The ant has no overseer; there is none to regulate or see that the work is done. Each ant apparently works independently of the rest, though guided by a common instinct to add to the common store. In moshel we have the highest title of dignity and power, the word signifying a lord, prince, or ruler, from mashal, \"to rule.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTProvideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. It is this characteristic, combined with what has just been said, which gives point to the lesson the sluggard is to learn. The teacher, as it were, argues: If the ant, so insignificant a creature in the order of the animal kingdom, is so provident, how much more should you be - you, a man endued with superior intelligence, and with so many more resources at hand, and with greater advantages! If the ant, with none to urge, direct, or control her work, is so industrious, surely she provides an example at which you, the sluggard, should blush, since there is every external incentive to rouse you to action - your duty to the community, the urgent advice of your friends, and your dignity as a man. If she provides for the future, much more should you do so, and threw off your sloth. Objection has been taken to what is here stated of the provident habits of the ant in storing food, on the ground that it is carnivorous and passes the winter in a state of torpidity. That the ant does lay up stores for future use has, however, been the opinion of all ages. Thus Hesiod ('Days,' 14) speaks of the ant as harvesting the grain, calling it ἴδρις, \"the provident.\" Virgil says ('Georg.,' 1, 186; cf. 'AEneid,' 4:4027) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Veluti ingentem formicae farris acervumNEWLINEQuum populant hiemis memores, tectoque repenunt.\" So the ants, when they plunder a tall heap of corn, mindful of the winter, store it in their cave. The language of Horace ('Sat.,' 1:50, 32) might be a comment on our passage -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Parvula (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris sicutNEWLINEOre trahit quodcunque potest, atque addit acervo,NEWLINEQuem struit, haud ignara ac non incauta futuri,NEWLINEQuae, simul universum contristat Aquarius annumNEWLINENon usquam prorepit, et illis utitur ante Quaesitis sapiens.\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"For thus the little ant (to human loreNEWLINENo mean example) forms her frugal store,NEWLINEGathered, with mighty toils, on every side,NEWLINENor ignorant, nor careless to provideNEWLINEFor future want; yet when the stars appearNEWLINEThat darkly sadden the declining year,NEWLINENo more she comes abroad, but wisely livesNEWLINEOn the fair store industrious summer gives.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Francis' Translation.) The same provident character is noted in AEsop's fable, 'The Ant and the Grasshopper;' see also Aristotle ('Hist. Nat.,' 9:6). All objections on this subject appear to be based on insufficient data, and have been conclusively answered by recent observation. Apart from the remark of Buffon, that \"the ants of tropical climates lay up provisions, and as they probably live the whole year, they submit themselves to regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe.\" The late Professor Darwin states of the agricultural ant of Texas, which in many features resembles the ant of Palestine, that it not only stores its food, but prepares the soil for the crops, keeps the ground free from weeds, and finally reaps the harvest (Journal of Linnaean Society, vol. 1, No. 21, p. 29). Canon Tristram also observes, \"The language of the wise man is not only in accordance with the universal belief of his own time, but with the accurately ascertained facts of natural history. Contrary to its habits in colder climates, the ant is not there dormant through the winter; and among the tamerisks of the Dead Sea it may be seen, in January, actively engaged in collecting the aphides and saccharine exudations, in long flies passing and repassing up and down the trunk. Two of the most common species of the Holy Land (Alta barbara, the black ant, and Alta structor, the brown ant) are strictly seed feeders, and in summer lay up large stores of grain for winter use. These species are spread along the whole of the Mediterranean coasts, but are unknown in more northern climates. Hence writers who were ignorant of ants beyond those of their own countries have been presumptuous enough to deny the accuracy of Solomon's statement\" ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 320). The Mishna, section 'Zeraim,' also contains a curious piece of legislation which bears testimony to the storing properties of the ant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9-Vers. 9-11 contain a call to the sluggard to rouse himself from his lethargy, and the warning of the evil consequences if he remains heedless of the reproof. How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? It is the same as if it were said, \"What infatuation is this which makes you lie and sleep as if you had nothing else to do?\" The double question stigmatizes the sluggard's utter indolence, and suggests the picture of his prolonging his stay in bed long after every one else is abroad and about his business. How long (Hebrew, ad-matha; Vulgate, usquequo); literally, till when? When; Hebrew, matha; Vulgate, quando. The came words are used in the same order in introducing a question in Nehemiah 2:6, \"For how long will the journey be? and when wilt thou return?\" Wilt thou... sleep. The Hebrew tish'kar is literally \"wilt thou lie,\" but the verb easily passes to the secondary meaning of \"to sleep.\" The delineation of the sluggard is again drawn in Proverbs 24:30-34 in almost identical language, but with some additions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Yet a Little sleep, etc. Is this the answer of the sluggard which the teacher takes up and repeats ironically, and in a tone of contempt? or is it the teacher's own language describing how the sluggard slides on insensibly to ruin? The Vulgate favours the latter view, \"Thou shalt sleep a little, thou shalt slumber a little, thou shalt fold thy hands to sleep, and then,\" etc. Habits, as Aristotle in his 'Ethics' has shown, are the resultant of repeated acts, and habits entail consequences. So here the inspired teacher would have it learnt, from the example of the sluggard, that the self-indulgence which he craves leads on to a confirmed indolence, which in the end leaves him powerless. \"Yet a little\" is the phrase on the lips of every one who makes but a feeble resistance, and yields supinely to his darling vice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. The inevitable consequences of sloth - poverty and want, two terms conveying the idea of utter destitution - are described under a twofold aspect: first, as certain; second, as irresistible. Poverty will advance upon the sluggard with the unerring precision and swiftness with which a traveller tends towards the end of his journey, or, as Michaelis puts it, \"quasi viator qui impigre pergit ac proprius venit donec propositum itineris scopum contingat\" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores'). Muffet, in loc., keeping to the figure, however, explains differently, \"Poverty shall overtake thee, as a swift traveller does one who walks slowly.\" The Authorized Version, \"as one that travelleth,\" correctly represents the original kim'hallek. There is no ground whatever, from the use of the verb, for rendering the piel participle m'hallek as \"a robber.\" The verb halak invariably means \"to go, or walk,\" and the piel or intensive form of the verb means \"to walk vigorously, or quickly.\" The participle can only mean this in the two other passages where it occurs - Psalm 104:3 and Ecclesiastes 4:14. The substantive helek in 2 Samuel 12:4 also signifies \"a traveller.\" So the Vulgate here, quasi viator. The other view, it is stated, is required by the parallel expression in the second hemistich, \"as an armed man,\" and receives some support from the LXX. reading, ὥσπερ κακὸς ὁδοιπόρος, \"as an evil traveller,\" which may mean either a traveller bringing evil news, or one who wanders about with an evil intention and purpose, in the sense of the Latin grassator, \"a highwayman.\" In this case the meaning would be that poverty shall come upon the sluggard as he is indulging in his sloth, and leave him destitute as if stripped by a robber. But the destitution of the sluggard wilt not only be certain and swift, it will be also irresistible. His want shall come upon him as an armed man (k'ish magen); literally, as a man of a shield; Vulgate, quasi vir armatus; i.e. like one fully equipped, and who attacks his foe with such onset and force that against him resistance is useless. As the unarmed, unprepared man succumbs to such an opponent, so shall the sluggard fall before want. The expressions,\" thy poverty\" and \"thy want,\" represent the destitution of the sluggard as flowing directly from his own habit of self-indulgence. It is his in a special manner) and he, not others, is alone responsible for it. Compare, beside the parallel passage Proverbs 24:33, the similar teaching in ch. 10:4; 13:4; 20:4. The Vulgate, LXX., and Arabic Versions at the close of this verse add, \"But if thou art diligent, the harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee;\" the LXX. making a further addition, \"as a bad runner (ὥσπερ κακὸς δρομεὺς).\" It is observable, in comparing this section with the preceding, that the teacher pursues the subject of the sluggard to its close, while he leaves the end of the surety undetermined. The explanation may be in the difference in character of the two. The surety may escape the consequences of his act, but there is no such relief for the sluggard. His slothfulness becomes a habit, which increases the more it is indulged in, and leads to consequences which are as irremediable as they are inevitable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-19. - 11. Eleventh admonitory discourse. Warning against mischievousness as a thing hateful to God. The connection of this with the preceding discourse is not at first sight very clear, but it may be found in the fact, attested only too unhappily by experience, that sloth leads those who indulge in it to such vices as are next enumerated. The sluggard may develop into a treacherous and deceitful man, and even if such should not happen, the characteristics of the two are nearly allied, and their end is much the same. St. Paul, in his First Epistle to Timothy, observes this same combination of character, and remarks that idlers are \"tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not\" (see 1 Timothy 6:13). The intention of the discourse is obviously to dissuade all, and especially the young, from the vices, and to preserve them from the ruin, of those men of whom \"the naughty person and wicked man\" is the type. Verse 12. - A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. The teacher begins by stating in general terms the nature and character of the man whom he now holds up as a warning to others, and then proceeds to point out the various features in his conduct and behaviour by which he may be known. In concise terms he is described as \"a naughty person, a wicked man.\" This is pre-eminently his character, and the first feature in it is that his life is one of wilful and injurious misreprescntation of the truth. A naughty person, a wicked man. In apposition and mutually explanatory. The grammatical arrangement of the sentences which follow, each of which is introduced by a participle, and is thus coordinate to the ethers, as well as the parallel terms, \"person\" (adam) and \"man\" (ish), determine this apposition. So Bertheau and Delitzsch. Others (as Zockler, Noyes, Kamph), however, connect the second expression with the series of characteristics which follow, and render, \"A worthless person is a deceiver, who,\" etc., but wrongly. A naughty person (Hebrew, adam b'liyyaal); literally, a man of Belial; Vulgate, homo apostata; LXX., ἀνὴρ ἄφρων. The word \"Belial\" is derived from b'li, \"without,\" and yaal, \"profit\" (i.e. \"without profit\"), or from b'li and ol, \"yoke\" (i.e. \"without yoke\"), and strictly signifies either a worthless or a lawless person. The latter derivation is, however, rejected by Gesenius and others. Its abstract signification is worthlessness, uselessness; its concrete or adjectival, worthless. The word \"naughty\" (Anglo-Saxon, naht, ne aht, \"not anything,\" equivalent to \"nothing\"), in the sense of good-for-nothing, ne'er-do-well, adopted in the Authorized Version, exactly reproduces its strict etymological meaning. The word, however, always carries with it the idea of moral turpitude. In the present instance its meaning is determined by the appositional phrase, \"a man of iniquity,\" or \"a wicked man,\" and such iniquity as takes the form of mischief making, deceit, and sowing discord among brethren. The \"man of Belial\" is not therefore simply, as its etymological derivation would imply, a worthless individual, one who is of no use either to himself or to the community at large, but a positively wicked, iniquitous, and despicable character. The meaning of the word varies in other passages. Thus in Deuteronomy 13:13, where it first occurs, it is used to designate those who have fallen sway into idolatry, and induce others to follow their example. In this sense it corresponds with the Vulgate, apostata, as signifying a defection from the worship of the true God. Again, in 1 Samuel 1:16 it is applied to the profanation of sacred places. When Hannah is accused by Eli of drunkenness in God's house at Shiloh, she replies, \"Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial.\" In the historical books (e.g. Judges, 1 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles), where it is of frequent occurrence, it has the general meaning of \"wickedness,\" under whatever form it appears. So in the Psalms (Psalm 18:4; Psalm 41:8; Psalm 101:3) and Nahum (Nahum 1:11, 15). In the Book of Job (Job 34:18, once only) it is used adjectively and as a term of reproach, \"Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked [b'liyyaal; i.e. 'worthless']?\" Individuals possessing the qualities of worthlessness, profanity, or wickedness are designated in Holy Scripture either as \"sons,\" \"children,\" \"daughters,\" or \"men of Belial.\" The word only occurs in two other passages in the Proverbs - Proverbs 16:27 and Proverbs 19:28. In the New Testament (2 Corinthians 6:15) the word \"Belial\" (Greek, βελίαρ or βελίαλ) appears as an appellative of Satan, ὁ πονηρὸς, \"the evil one,\" as the representative of all that is bad, and as antichrist. A wicked man (Hebrew, ish aven); literally, a man of vanity or iniquity; Vulgate, vir inutilis; LXX., ἀνὴρ παράνομος. The radical idea of aven (from un, \"nothing\") is that of emptiness or vanity, and has much, therefore, in common with b'liyaal. Its secondary meaning, and that which it usually bears in Scripture, is iniquity. \"A man of iniquity\" is one who is altogether deficient in moral consciousness, and who goes about to work wickedness and do hurt and injury to others (cf. ver. 18 and Job 22:15). Walketh with a froward mouth. His first characteristic, as already observed. His whole life and conduct are marked by craftiness, deceit, perversion, and misrepresentation, and an utter want of truth. \"Walking\" is here, as elsewhere in Scripture, used of some particular course of conduct. So we find the LXX. paraphrase, πορεύεται ὁδοὺς οὐκ ἀγαθάς. \"he enters or walks not in good ways.\" With a froward mouth (Hebrew, ik'shuth peh); literally, with perversity of mouth; Vulgate, ore perverse. Symmachus has στρεβλύμασι στόματος, \"with perversity of mouth.\" The mouth, or speech, is the vehicle by which this person gives outward expression to the evil thoughts which are inwardly filling his heart. The phrase occurs before in Proverbs 4:24. The meaning of the passage is well illustrated in Psalm 10:7, \"His mouth is full of misery, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers. He employs his other members for the same nefarious purpose. In the language of St. Paul, he yields his members to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity (Romans 6:19). \"To wink with the eye (karats ayin),\" as in Proverbs 10:10 and Psalm 35:19, or \"with the eyes (karats b'eynayim),\" is properly to compress or nip them together, and so to wink, and give the signal to others not to interfere (Gesenius and Delitzsch); cf. the LXX., ἐννεύει ὀφθαλμῷ; and the Vulgate, annuit oculis. Aquila and Theodoret, however, read, κνίζει, \"he vexes or annoys.\" The observation of the teacher in Proverbs 10:10 is, \"He that winketh with his eyes causeth sorrow.\" The same verb karuts is also used of the compression or closing of the lips in Proverbs 16:30. He speaketh with his feet; i.e. he conveys signs by them to his companion; cf. the LXX., σημαίνει δὲ ποδὶ, and the Vulgate, terit pede, which conveys much the same meaning. He teacheth with his fingers; or, as more fully expressed in the LXX., διδάσκει δὲ ἐννεύμασι δακτύλων, \"he teacheth by the signs of his fingers.\" Symmachus has δακτυλοδεικτῶν, which, however, in its strictly classical use (see Demosthenes, 790, 20) is pointing at with the finger. \"Teaching\" is only the secondary meaning of the Hebrew participle moreh, which is here used. The verb yarah, to which it belongs, means properly to extend or stretch out the hand for the purpose of pointing out the way (compare the Hebrew shalakh yod, and the Latin monstrare), and hence came to mean \"to teach.\" The crafty and deceitful character which is here presented to as is strikingly reproduced in Ecclesiasticus: \"He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him\" (Ecclus. 27:22-24). The heathen poet Naevius says of the impudent woman -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Allium tenet, alii adnutat, alibi manusNEWLINEEst occupata: est alii percellit pedem.\" Compare also Ovid's words ('Amor.,' 1:4, 16) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Clam mihi tange pedem:NEWLINEMe specta, mutusque meos, vultumque loquacem...NEWLINEVerba superciliis sine voce loquentia dicam;NEWLINEVerba leges digitis.\" So Tibullus, 1:12 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Illa viro coram nutus conferre loquacesNEWLINEBlandaque compositis abdere verba notis.\" The lesson which we may learn from this verse is not to abuse the members of our bodies, by employing them for the purposes of deceit and hypocrisy, and so to promote evil, but to put them to their natural and legitimate use.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - From these external features the teacher passes to the heart the seat of all this mischief and deceit. In this respect we observe a striking correspondence with the method adopted by our Saviour in his leaching, who referred everything to the heart, as the true seat of all that was good or bad in man. Frowardness is in his heart (Hebrew, tah'pukoth b'libbo); i.e. his heart is full of perverse imaginations, it is there he nourishes his jealousy, his hatred, his malice, his ill will. It is there, too, he deviseth mischief continually. \"Devising mischief\" carries us one step further back in the history of evil. It is this feature, this deliberate premeditation to plot mischief and to devise means to carry it into execution, which makes the character of the man simply diabolical. He makes his heart as it were the workshop wherein he fabricates and prepares his villainy. The Hebrew kharash (to which the participle khoresh belongs) is equivalent to the Vulgate machinari, and the LXX. τεκαίνομαι, \"to fabricate, devise, plot.\" (See Proverbs 3:29 and ver. 18; and cf. Psalm 36:4, \"He deviseth mischief upon his bed.\") The LXX. combines the two statements in one proposition: \"A perverse heart deviseth evil at all times.\" Similarly the Vulgate, which, however, joins \"continually\" (Hebrew, b'koleth; Vulgate, omni tempore) to the second hemistich, thus: \"And at all times he sows discord (et omni tempore jurgia seminat).\" He soweth discord (Hebrew, mid'-yanim (Keri) y'shalleakh); literally, he sends forth (i.e. excites) strife; or, as the margin, he casteth forth strife. The Keri reading mid'yanim, for the Khetib m'danim, is probably, as Hitzig suggests, derived from Genesis 37:36. The phrase occurs again as shallakh m'danim in ver. 19, and as shillakh madon Proverbs 16:28 (cf. Proverbs 10:12). This is the culminating point in the character of the wicked man. He takes delight in breaking up friendship and in destroying concord among brethren (see ver. 19), and thus destroys one of the most essential elements for promoting individual happiness and the welfare of the community at large. This idea of the community is introduced into the LXX., which reads, \"Such an one brings disturbance to the city (ὁ τοσοῦτος ταραχὰς συνίστησι πόλει).\" The motive cause may be either malice or self-interest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. Great sins, as Muffet, in loc., observes, have great punishments; neither only great, but sudden. Therefore; Hebrew, al-ken. A Nemesis or retribution awaits this man of malice and deceit. His calamity or destruction is represented as the direct result of, as flowing forth from, what he has done. His calamity; Hebrew, eydo. On eyd, see Proverbs 1:26. Shall come suddenly; i.e. sooner than he anticipates; when he thinks his diabolical plans are succeeding, then suddenly his victims will discover his fraud and malice, and will rise and inflict the punishment which is his due. Suddenly; petha, a variation of pithom just used. Shall he be broken; Hebrew, yish-shaver; Vulgate, conteretur. The verb shavar, \"to break,\" \"to break to pieces,\" is used of ships which are wrecked (Isaiah 14:29; Ezekiel 27:34; Jonah 1:4); of an army which is defeated and dispersed (Daniel 11:22; 2 Chronicles 14:12); of the destruction of a kingdom, city, or people (Isaiah 8:15; Jeremiah 48:4); and of the complete prostration of the spirit of man by affliction (Psalm 34:19); and as such, in the passage before us, conveys the idea of the complete ruin of this man. It is a destruction that shall break him up. Without remedy (Hebrew, v'eyn mar'pe; literally, and there is no remedy. There shall be, as Fleischer, as it were, no means of recovery for his shattered members. His destruction shall be irremediable, or as the LXX., a συντριβή ἀνίαψτος, a contritio insanibilis; or as the Vulgate, nec habebit ultra medicinam. The idea seems to be taken from the shattered fragments of a potter's vessel, which it is impossible to reunite. So in the case of the man whose life has been one of fraud, deceit, and malice, there is for him no hope of any recovery. The language may seem exaggerated, but the picture is painted with this high colouring to exhibit a strong deterrent to such a line of conduct, and further, it may be remarked that, in the present day, only the most confiding would again put trust in a man who has wilfully and maliciously deceived them (cf. Isaiah 30:14). The second hemistich of this verse occurs again verbatim in Proverbs 29:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The whole structure and arrangement of the thoughts which occur in vers. 16-19 clearly show that this is not an independent section, but one closely allied to that which has just preceded. The object is to show that those evil qualities of deceit and malice which are disastrous to man are equally odious in the sight of Jehovah, and consequently within the scope of the Divine displeasure. These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. The use of the numerical proverb, though common to the gnomic literature of Persia and Arabia, as Umbreit shows, is by our author confined to this single instance. Other examples occur in our book in the words of Agur the son of Jakeh (see Proverbs 30:7-9, 24-28), and the midda, the name given by later Jewish writers to this form of proverb, is observable in the ape-cryphal Book of Ecclesiasticus (see Proverbs 23:16; Proverbs 20:7 and Proverbs 26:5-28). When, as in the present instance, two numbers are given, the larger number corresponds with the things enumerated. So in Job 5:19. In Amos 1 and 2, however, there is an exception to this rule, where the numbers appear to be used indefinitely. As to the origin of the numerical proverb, the most probable explanation is that given by Hitzig and adopted by Zockler, namely, that it is due to the exigencies of parallelism. The author first adopts one number optionally, and then a second is employed as a parallel to it. Here, however, the number determined on in the writer's mind is the larger number seven, and the smaller number six is used as a rhetorical parallel. An examination of the following verses will show that the seven exactly measures the things which are described as odious to the Lord. The Authorized Version, so far as the numbers are concerned, exactly represents the original, which, by the use of the cardinal number \"seven\" (sheva), and not the ordinal \"seventh,\" which would be sh'vii, shows that the things enumerated are equally an abomination in God's sight. The view therefore, that the seventh vice is odious to God in an especial degree above the others, is untenable, though it has found defenders in Lowenstein, Bertheau, and von Gerlach, and is supported by the Vulgate, Sex sunt quae odit Dominus, et septimum detestatur anima ejus. All the seven things are execrable, all are equally objects of the Divine abhorrence. Besides, we cannot imagine that the vice of sowing discord among brethren, of ver. 19, is more odious to God than the crime of shedding innocent blood of ver. 17. Unto him (Hebrew, naph'sho); literally, of his soul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The enumeration begins with pride. A proud look (Hebrew, eynayim ramoth); literally, haughty or lofty eyes, as in the margin; Vulgate, oculos sublimes; LXX., ὀφθάλμὸς ὑβριστοῦ. It is not merely the look which is meant, but the temper of mind which the look expresses (Wardlaw). The lofty look is the indication of the swelling pride which fills the heart, the mentis elatae tumor, the supreme disdain, grande supercilium, for everything and everybody. Pride is put first, because it is at the bottom of all disobedience and rebellion against God's laws. It is the very opposite of humility, which the apostle, in Ephesians 4:2, mentions as the basis, as it were, of all the virtues. All pride is intended, and the face of the Lord is against this pride. He \"resisteth the proud;\" he \"knoweth them afar off;\" he \"hath respect unto the lowly;\" he \"will bring down high looks\" (Psalm 18:27); he judgeth those that are high (Job 21:22). It is against this spirit that Job prays Jehovah \"to behold every one that is proud, and abase him,\" and \"to look upon every one that is proud, and bring him low\" (Job 40:11, 12). The next thing in the enumeration is a lying tongue. Lying is hateful to God, because he is the God of truth. In a concise form the expression, \"a lying tongue,\" represents what has been already said in vers. 12 and 13 of \"the wicked man\" who \"walks with a froward mouth,\" and whose conduct is made up of deceit. Lying is the wilful perversion of truth, not only by speech, but by any means whatever whereby a false impression is conveyed to the mind. The liar \"sticks not at any lies, flatteries, or calumnies\" (Patrick). Lying is elsewhere denounced as the subject which excites the Divine displeasure (see Psalm 5:6; Psalm 120:3, 4; Hosea 4:1-3; Revelation 21:8, 27); and in the early Christian Church, in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, it was punished with death. On the subject of lying, see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' c. 18, wherein he says, \"Mihi autem videtur peccatum quidem esse omne mendacium.\" Every lie is a sin. The third thing is hands that shed innocent blood, i.e. a murderous and cruel disposition, which, rather than have its plans frustrated, will imbue the hands with innocent blood, i.e. the blood of those who have done it no injury. The Divine command is, \"Thou shall do no murder,\" and those who break it will find, even if they escape man, that the Lord is \"the avenger of blood,\" and that he \"maketh inquisition\" for it (cf. ch. 1. and 2, and Isaiah 59:7, which bear a close resemblance to this passage). That the shedding of innocent blood cues for vengeance, and pulls down God's heavy judgments on the murderer, appears in the case of Cain and Abel (Muffet).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The fourth thing is an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations. \"Wicked imaginations\" are literally \"thoughts of iniquity;\" Hebrew, makh'sh'voth aven; Vulgate, cogitationes pessimas; LXX., λογισμοὺς κακοὺς. The same expression in Isaiah 59:7 is rendered \"thoughts of iniquity.\" (On deviseth, Hebrew khoresh, see ver. 14 and ch. 3:29.) The thought is a repetition of ver. 14a. There are evil thoughts in all men's hearts; but the devising, fabricating of them, and thus making the heart into a devil's workshop, is the mark of utter depravity and wickedness, and is abhorrent to God. The devices of the heart, though planned in secret, are clear to him \"to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are bid.\" The peculiar position which the heart occupies in the enumeration is to be accounted for on the ground that it is the fountain, not only of those vices which have been already mentioned, but of those which follow. The fifth thing is feet that be swift in running to mischief. Again we are reminded of Isaiah 59:7, \"Their feet run to evil.\" \"Mischief\" (Hebrew, ra) is a re-echo of ver. 14 and Proverbs 1:16. \"To run to mischief\" is to carry out with alacrity and without delay what has already been devised in the heart. It implies more than falling or sliding into sin, which is common to all. It denotes, Cornelius a Lapide remarks, \"inexplebilem sceleris aviditatem, et destinatum studium.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The sixth thing is perjury. A false witness that speaketh lies; literally, he that breathes out, or utters, lies as a false witness. So the Vulgate, proferentem mendacia testem fallacem. The Hebrew puakh is \"to breathe,\" \"to blow,\" and in the hiph. form, which is used here (yaphiakh, hiph. future), it is \"to blow out\" or\" utter,\" either in a bad sense, as in the present instance, and in Proverbs 6:19; Proverbs 14:5; Proverbs 19:5, 9 (cf. Psalm 10:5; Psalm 12:5); or in a good sense, \"to utter the truth,\" as in Proverbs 12:17. Lies; Hebrew k'zavim, plural of kazav, \"falsehood,\" \"lying\" (cf. Proverbs 21:25). A false witness (Hebrew, ed-k'zavim), as in margin, \"a witness of lies.\" The expression, \"as a false witness,\" as it appears in the original, is explanatory, and indicates the particular aspect under which the speaking of lies is regarded. Lying in its more general sense has been already spoken of in ver. 17. The vice which is here noted as odious to God is expressly forbidden in the moral code, \"Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour\" (Exodus 20:16). But this, though the chief, is only one view of the case. Perjury may be employed, not only in ruining the innocent, but also in screen-tog the guilty. \"Much hurt,\" says Muffet, in loc., \"doth the deceitful and lying witness, for he corrupteth the judge, oppresseth the innocent, suppresseth the truth, and in the courts of justice sinneth against his own soul and the Lord himself most grievously.\" \"He that speaketh lies as a false witness,\" again, may be the vile instrument in the hands of unscrupulous and inexorable enemies, as those employed against our Lord and Stephen. Perjury, too, destroys the security of communities. The shipwreck of society which it occasions may be seen in the frightful misery which ensued when the system of delatores was not only countenanced, but encouraged under the Roman empire. Truly speaking, he that lies as a false witness must be hateful to God. And he that soweth discord among brethren; the seventh and last thing in the enumeration, but not, as Delitzsch holds, the ne plus ultra of all that is hated of God. It closes, as in ver. 14, the series, but with the addition \"among brethren;\" thus emphatically stigmatizing the conduct of that man as diabolical who destroys the harmony and unity of those who ought to live together in brotherly affection, and who disturbs the peace of communities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-35. - 12. Twelfth admonitory discourse. In this the teacher returns again to the subject which he has already treated in the eighth discourse. The extreme tendency of men, and especially young men, to sins of impurity is no doubt, as Delitzsch remarks, the reason why this subject is again resumed. The subject is gradually worked up to the preceding admonitions in vers. 20-23, pointing out that the way of life, the way of safety, is to be secured by obedience to the precepts of parents, whose commandment and law illumine the perilous road of life, and whose reproofs are salutary to the soul. The arguments against the sin of adultery are cogent in their dissuasiveness, and none stronger of a purely temporal nature could be devised. It may be objected that the sin is not put forward in the higher light, as an offence before God. and that the appeal is made simply on the lines of self-interest; but who will deny that the scope of the teaching is distinctly moral, or that mankind is not influenced and dissuaded from sin by such a category of evils as includes personal beggary, dishonour, and death? Verse 20. - The first part of this verse is couched in almost the same terms as that of Proverbs 1:8, except that mitz'rath, \"precept,\" preceptum, is here used instead of musar, eruditio, or \"disciplinary instruction,\" while the latter part of the two verses are identical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This verse recalls also Proverbs 3:3, and reminds us of the use of the phylacteries, or tefellim, common among the Jews of our Lord's time, and the practice of binding which upon various parts of the person may have had its origin in this and such like passages. The \"tying about\" the neck may suggest the use of amulets, an Oriental custom, to ward off evil, but it is more likely that it refers to the wearing of ornaments. Them; i.e. the commandment and law of father and mother respectively, expressed in the Hebrew by the suffix -em, in the verb kosh'rem, equivalent to liga ea, and again in ondem, equivalent to vinci ea. (For the personal use of this figure, see Song of Solomon 8:6.) Tie them; Hebrew, ondem. The verb anad, \"to tie,\" only occurs twice as a verb - here and in Job 31:36. Lee prefers \"to bind;\" Delitzsch, however, states that it is equivalent to the Latin circumplicare, \"to wind about.\" The meaning of this and similar passages (cf. Proverbs 7:3; Exodus 13:9; Deuteronomy 6:8; Deuteronomy 11:13) is that the commandment, precept, law, or whatever is intended, should be always present to the mind. The heart suggests that they are to be linked to the affections, and the neck that they will be an ornament decking the moral character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The going, sleeping, and awaking occur in the same order in the Pentateuch, from which the ideas of this and the preceding verse are evidently derived (see Deuteronomy 6:7 and Deuteronomy 11:19). Though only specifying three conditions, they refer to the whole conduct of life, and hence the verse promises direction, guardianship, and converse of wisdom, which will undoubtedly attend life where the precepts of parents are lovingly treasured and obediently observed. The Authorized Version conveys the impression that it is \"the keeping\" of the parents' precepts, etc., which is to bear such results; but it is better to understand \"it\" as signifying the whole teaching or doctrine of wisdom, as Delitzsch. Wisdom becomes personified in the representation, and identified with her teaching. It shall lead thee. The Hebrew verb nakhah, \"to lead,\" in the sense of \"to direct,\" like the Latin dirigere (Delitzsch), and as it is used in Exodus and Numbers, passim. In the Psalms (Psalm 5:9; Psalm 27:11; Psalm 31:4, etc.) it is employed of God as governing men. Hence, in the affairs of life, Wisdom will so guide and control us that we shall act uprightly. There is the further notion imported into the word of preservation from evil (cf. Proverbs 3:23, \"Thou shalt walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble\"). When thou sleepest; or, when thou liest down, as in Proverbs 3:25, where the same verb occurs. It shall keep thee; i.e. watch over, keep safe, or preserve; as in the Vulgate, custodire, and the LXX. φυλαττεῖν. We have had the same verb, shamar, before in Proverbs 2:11. Wisdom will be as it were a guardian angel in our hours of repose. When thou awakest; Hebrew, hakitsotha, the hiph. perfect of kutz. This word only occurs here. The hiph. form, hekitz, is intransitive, \"to be aroused\" (cf. the LXX., ἐγειρομένῳ). It shall talk with thee; rather, she. Bertheau renders, \"She will make thee thoughtful;\" and Dathe, \"Let them be thy meditation;\" but the accusative suffix designates the person who is the object of the action of the verb, as in Psalm 5:5; Psalm 42:4; Zechariah 7:5 (Zockler) and as Delitzseh remarks, the personification requires something more than a mere meditation with one's self on the precepts of Wisdom. Wisdom herself shall hold converse with thee (cf. the LXX., συλλαλῇ σοι), she shall suggest thoughts how thou art to behave thyself. The meaning of the verb, \"to meditate,\" \"to think deeply,\" however, need not be lost sight of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light. The teacher takes up the words \"commandment\" (Hebrew, mitzrah) and \"law\" (Hebrew, torah) from ver. 20, which he describes respectively as \"a lamp\" and \"light\" The \"commandment\" is any special or particular commandment which harmonizes with God's will, and commands what is to be done and forbids what is to be left undone. The \"law\" is the whole law of God in its entirety; not here the Law of Moses technically, but the whole system of generalized instruction; They stand, therefore, in the same relation to each other as \"a lamp\" and \"light,\" the one being particular, and the other general. \"Light\" (Hebrew, or) is light in general, as the light of the day and the sun, while \"a lamp\" (Hebrew, ner, from nur, \"to shine) is a particular light like that of a candle, which is enkindled at some other source. The \"commandment\" and the \"law\" alike enlighten the conscience and enable one to walk in his way of life. On this passage Le Clerc remarks, \"Ut in tenebris lucerna, aut fax ostendit nobis, qua eundam sit: in ignorantiae humanae caligine, quae nos per hanc totam vitam cingit, revelatio divina nos docet, quid sit faciendum, quid vitandum.\" So the psalmist says in Psalm 19:8, \"The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;\" and again in Psalm 119:105, \"Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path;\" i.e. they direct and show the true way of faith and life (Gejerus). The \"commandment\" and the \"law\" may stand for the whole revelation of God without reference to any particular precept (as Scott), but they have here a specific bearing on a particular form of human conduct, as appears from the following verses. And reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Reproofs of instruction; Hebrew, tok'khoth musar, disciplinary reproofs, i.e. reproofs whose object is the discipline of the soul and the moral elevation of the character. The LXX. reads, καὶ ἔλεγχος καὶ παιδεία; thus connecting it with education in its highest sense. Such reproofs are a way of life (Hebrew, derek khayyim), i.e. they lead to life; they conduce to the prolongation of life. This view of the subject, so prominent in the mind of the teacher in other passages (cf. Proverbs 3:2 and 19), must not be lost sight of, though the words are susceptible of another interpretation, as indicating that the severest reproofs, inasmuch as they correct errors and require obedience, conduce to the greatest happiness (Patrick). Or again, it may mean that disciplinary reproofs are necessary to life. The soul to arrive at perfection must undergo them as part of the conditions of its existence, and, consequently, they are to be submitted to with the consciousness that, however irksome they may be, they are imposed for its eventual benefit (cf. Hebrews 12:5). But this interpretation is unlikely from what follows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - To keep thee from the evil woman. The specific object to which the discourse was tending. The \"commandment\" and the \"law\" illuminate the path of true life generally, but in a special degree they, if attended to, will guard the young against sins of impurity, fornication, and adultery. The evil woman (Hebrew, esheth ra); strictly, a woman of evil, or vileness, or of a wicked disposition, addicted to evil in an extraordinary degree; ra being here a substantive standing in a genitive relation to esheth, as in Proverbs 2:12, \"The way of evil (derek ra).\" Cf. also tah'pukoth ra, perverstates mali (Proverbs 2:14), and makh'sh'voth ra, cogitationes mali (Proverbs 15:26), and an'shey ra, viri mali (Proverbs 28:5). The Vulgate, however, gives an adjectival force to ra rendering, it muliere mala. The LXX. ἀπὸ γυναικὸς, i.e. \"from the married woman,\" arises from reading rea, \"a companion,\" for ra, \"evil.\" From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman; i.e. from her enticements; Hebrew, mekhel'kath lashon noh'riyyah; literally, \"from the smoothness of a strange tongue,\" as in the margin. Zockler, however, proposes an emendation of the Masoretic text, and substitutes the construct case, l'shon, for the absolute, lashon, rendering as in the Authorized Version, on the ground that the emphasis lies, not on the \"tongue,\" which would be the case if we render \"of a strange tongue,\" but on \"the strange woman,\" who is the subject of the discourse, as in Proverbs 2:16 and Proverbs 5:20. But nok'riyyah is feminine of the adjective nok'ri, ann in agreement with lashon, which, though common, is more frequently feminine (Gesenius), and hence the two words may stand in agreement. The marginal reading is to be preferred (Wordsworth). Again, me-khel'kath, the construct ease of khel'kah, literally, \"smoothness,\" and metaphorically flattery, with the prefix me, forms one member of the phrase, while the compound expression, lashon nok'riyyah, forms the second. Ewald and Bertheau render, \"from the smooth-tongued, the strange woman,\" thus connecting mekhel'kath lashon, and regarding nok'riyyah as a separate and distinct idea. They agree with Symmachus and Theodotion, ἀπὸ λειογλώσσου ξένης, i.e. \"from the smooth-tongued or flattering stranger.\" So the Vulgate, a blanda lingua extraneae, i.e. from the smooth tongue of the strange woman. The LXX. again favours the marginal reading, ἀπὸ διαβολῆς γλώσσης ἀλλοτρίας, \"from the slander of a strange tongue.\" So the Chaldee Paraphrase. The Syriac reads, \"from the accusation of a woman of a strange tongue,\" i.e. who uses a foreign language. If, however, the Authorized Version be retained, the Hebrew nok'riyyah will, as in other passages, mean \"an adulteress\" (Gesenius); Proverbs 5:20; Proverbs 7:5; Proverbs 23:27. Under any circumstances, we have here attributed to the tongue what, in fact, belongs to the woman. It is against the enticements and blandishments of a woman of depraved moral character that the \"commandment\" and \"law\" form a safeguard to youth. Verse 25. - Lust not after her beauty in thine heart. The admonition of this verse embraces the two sides of the subject - the external allurement and the internal predisposition to vice. Lust not after (Hebrew, al-takh'mod); strictly, desire not, since the verb khamad is properly\" to desire, or covet.\" The same verb is used in Exodus 20:17, \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,\" and Exodus 34:24, \"Neither shall any man desire thy land\" (cf. Micah 2:2 and Proverbs 12:12). In Psalm 68:19; Isaiah 1:29; Isaiah 53:2, it has the sense of taking delight in anything. It may be questioned whether it ever has the strong meaning given in the Vulgate (non concupiscat) and adopted in the Authorized Version, \"to lust after\" (Holden). Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus render μὴ ἐπιθυμήσῃς. The use of khamad here reveals the warning of the Decalogue. In thine heart; Hebrew, bil'va-veka. corresponding to the ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ of Matthew 5:28. The admonition is a warning to repress the very first inclinations to unchaste desires. They may be unobserved and undetected by ethers, but they are known to ourselves, and the first duty of repressing them calls for an act of determination and will on our part. Our Lord teaches (Matthew 5:28, cited above), \"That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" The LXX. reading is Μή σε νικήσῃ κάλλους ἐπιθυμία, \"Let not the desire of beauty conquer thee.\" Neither let her take thee with her eyelids; i.e. do not let her captivate thee with her amorous glances. Take. The Hebrew verb, lakakh, is \"to captivate\" with blandishments, \"to allure, beguile\" (cf. Proverbs 11:30); LXX., μήδε ἀγρευθῃς. With her eyelids (Hebrew, b'aph'appeyah); or perhaps more literally, with her eyelashes (Zockler). The eyelids; Hebrew, aph'appayim, dual of aph'aph, so called from their rapid, volatile motion, are here compared with nets, as by Philostratus ('Epistles:' Γυναικί), who speaks of \"the nets of the eyes (τὰ τῶν ὀμμάτων δίκτυα).\" The eyelids are the instruments by which the amorous woman beguiles or catches her victims. She allures him by her glances. So St. Jerome says, \"The eye of an harlot is the snare of her lover.\" The wanton glance is expressed in the Vulgate by nutibus illius; cf. \"The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids\" (Ecclus. 26:9). Milton ('Paradise Lost,' 11:620) speaks of the daughters of men \"rolling the eye,\" amongst other things, in order to captivate the sons of God. Piscator and Mercerus understand the eyelids as standing metonymically for the beauty of the eye; and Bayne, for the general adornment of the head in order to attract attention. Allusion may possibly be made to the custom of Eastern women painting the eyelids to give brilliancy and expression; cf. 2 Kings 9:30 (Wordsworth). A striking parallel to the verse before us occurs in Propertius, lib. 1. 'Eleg.' 1., \"Cynthia prima suis miserum me cepit ocellis.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread. From this verse onwards to the end of the chapter the discourse consists of a series of arguments, each calculated to deter youth from the sins of fornication and adultery, by exhibiting the evil consequences of such indulgence. The first is the poverty and extreme beggary to which a man is brought. For by means of; Hebrew, ki v'ad. Lee gives the preposition vaad the force of \"after,\" i.e. after associating with. The radical idea of the preposition is that of nearness, by, near, and easily passes to that of \"because\" (Gesenius) or \"by means of,\" as in the Authorized Version. It is here used for per, \"through,\" as in Joshua 2:15; 2 Samuel 20:23, and so indicates the transit through the way of fornication to extreme beggary (Gejerus). A whorish woman; Hebrew, ishshah zonah; Vulgate, scortum; LXX., πόρνη; \"a harlot,\" here corresponding to \"the adulteress\" (esheth ish), since the root zonah, \"to commit fornication,\" is attributed both to married and unmarried women (Genesis 38:24; Leo. 19:29; Hosea 3:3). The word zonah is sometimes written alone, as in Genesis 38:15 and Deuteronomy 23:19. The fuller expression, as here, occurs in Leviticus 21:7; Joshua 2:1; Judges 11:1. To a piece of bread; Hebrew, adkikkar lakhem. It will be noticed that there is an ellipsis in the Hebrew, which, however, may be easily supplied, as in the Authorized Version. Delitzsch supplies \"one cometh down to;\" so Zockler. \"A piece of bread' is properly \"a circle of bread, a small round piece of bread, such as is still baked in Italy (pagnotta) and in the East (Arabic kurs), here an expression for the smallest piece\" (Fleischer). The term occurs in Exodus 29:23; 1 Samuel 2:36, in the latter of which passages it expresses the extreme destitution to which the members of the house of Eli were to be reduced. As illustrating the term, see also ch. 38:21 and Ezekiel 13:19. The LXX. and Vulgate singularly render, \"For the price of a harlot is scarcely that of a bit of bread,\" which may mean, as Castalio, that she is of so little value; but the context is opposed to this rendering, where the Point brought out is not the vile character of the harlot as the ruin she inflicts or is the cause cf. Besides, the Hebrew ad does not mean ever \"scarcely,\" or \"hardly,\" which the Vulgate vix gives to it. And the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. The adulteress is isheth ish, literally, \"the woman of a man,\" or \"a man's wife,\" as in the margin - as, therefore, strictly an adulteress here (cf. Leviticus 20:10). Will hunt; Hebrew, thatsud; LXX., ἀγρεύει; Vulgate, capit. The Hebrew verb tsud, \"to lie in wait for,\" \"to hunt,\" also signifies \"to take, or capture,\" like the Vulgate capere, The verb in its metaphorical use also occurs in Lamentations 3:52; Micah 7:2; Psalm 140:12, and refers to those beguilements resorted to by the adulteress to seduce youth. In Ezekiel 13:18 it carries with it the idea of death, and if understood in this sense here it may have reference to the death penalty inflicted on adulterer and adulteress by the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 20:10), and introduces what is said more fully in vers. 32, 34, 35. The precious life; Hebrew, nephesh y'karah The epithet y'karah is appropriately added to nephesh, as indicating the high value of the life. All is implied in the nephesh, \"the life,\" moral dignity of character, the soul of man. It is the ever-existing part of the man, and therefore is precious - nothing can exceed it in value. Our Lord says (Matthew 16:26), \"What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" and the psalmist (Psalm 49:8), \"For the redemption of their life is precious.\" But it is for this life, or soul, that the adulteress hunts, and which she destroys. Lives of fornication and adultery, therefore, carry with them the severest penalties, the loss of temporal possessions, for the enjoyment of a transient passion, and far beyond this the loss of life both temporal and eternal. We cannot imagine a more deterrent warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - In this and the two following verses (28 and 29) the discourse proceeds from statement to illustration, and by examples of cause and effect the teacher shows \"the moral necessity of the evil consequences of the sin of adultery\" (Delitzsch). The meaning of the verses is plain enough, viz. that as it is in vain to suppose that a person's garment will not be burnt or his feet not be scorched if fire is brought near them, so it is equally inconceivable that a person indulging in adultery can escape its consequences or the retribution that follows. The two questions in vers. 27 and 28 imply a strong negative, and so prepare for the conclusion in ver. 30. Take fire. The Hebrew verb khathah signifies \"to take burning or live coals from the hearth\" (Placater); and hence is used here in a pregnant sense \"to take from the hearth and place in\" (cf. Proverbs 25:22, \"For thou wilt take coals ['and heap them:' Hebrew, gekhalim khotheh] on his head\"). The fuller expression is met with in Isaiah 30:14, \"So that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth (lakh'toth esh miyyakud).'\" The Vulgate renders by abscondere,\" to hide: Numquid potest homo absconders ignem; and the LXX. by ἀποδεῖν, equivalent to the Latin alligare \"to tie or bind fast.\" Wordsworth explains \"to take and heap up, as in a firepan or censer.\" In his bosom; Hebrew, b'kheyko; LXX., ἐν κόλπῳ; Vulgate, in sinu suo. The word kheyk is properly \"an undulation\" (Delitzsch). not the lap, but as in the Authorized Version here, \"the bosom,\" and \"the bosom of a garment\" as in ch. 16:33; 17:23; 21:14. The answer to the question of this and the next verse is of course a decided negative, but we may note that the teacher compares adultery to a burning fire in its consequences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Can one go upon hot coals, etc.? The repeated question is introduced by gin, \"if,\" here equivalent to the Latin an, used in double questions, as in Genesis 24:21; Exodus 17:7; Judges 9:2, etc. Go; i.e. walk upon hot coals (Hebrew, al-haggekalim); literally, upon the hot coals. The Hebrew gakheleth is coals thoroughly ignited, as in Leviticus 16:12 and Proverbs 25:22; different from pekham of Proverbs 26:21, which is \"a black coal,\" or, as Gesenius explains, charcoal unkindled. Be burned; Hebrew, tikkaveynah; i.e. be burned or scorched so as to leave a mark by burning, as in Isaiah 43:2; this being the force of the verb kavah. The flames of lust will certainly be visited with punishment, and with the stings of conscience. Job, speaking on this very subject, says a deviation from the paths of virtue \"is a fire that consumeth to destruction.\" And to him who gives way to adultery it may be said, in the words of Horace, though with a different application from that in which they were used by that poet, \"incedis per ignes suppositos cineri doloso.\" \"You are walking over fire that lies hidden under deceitful ashes\" (Gejerus).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. It is as great a folly to suppose that an adulterer will escape punishment as to imagine that no injury will follow where fire has been applied. Delitzsch illustrates this verse by a passage from Pythagoras's maxim ('Eclog.,' 100, 39), Τὸ εἰς πῦρ καὶ εἰς γυναῖκα ἐμπεσεῖν ἴσον ὑπάρχει Goeth in; Hebrew, habba el; i.e. has intercourse with, as in Genesis 6:4; Genesis 19:31; Genesis 38:9; Psalm 51:2. The same in force as \"toucheth.\" Shall not be innocent; Hebrew, lo-yinnakeh; i.e. poena vacuus,\"exempt from punishment,\" or shall be unpunished (Delitzsch, Zockler, Gesenius); cf. Proverbs 11:21, \"The wicked shall not be unpunished (lo yinnakeh)\" ashore. The verb nakah signifies rimarily \"to be pure;\" Bothe Vulgate tenders non erit mundus,\" he will not be pure;\" but the LXX. observes the secondary meaning of the verb, οὐκ ἀθωωθήσεται, non erit innoxius, \"he shall not be let go unpunished,\" the Alexandrine verb ἀθωόω. Certain and the very heaviest punishment shall come upon him (see also Proverbs 17:5; Jeremiah 25:29; Jeremiah 49:12). With this explanation agree Gejerus and Vatablus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The teacher continues his argument with another illustration, still keeping in view his object, which is to show that the punishment of the adulterer is a surely impending one and severe in its character. The argument in vers. 30-33 is one a fortiori. If men do not overlook but severely punish a crime which has been committed under extenuating circumstances, much less will they do so where the crime is of a much graver character and has nothing to excuse it. Theft and adultery are brought into comparison. Theft under all circumstances is a lesser crime than adultery, but here it is minimized to the lowest degree. The case of a man is taken who steals to satisfy his hunger; the extent of the theft cannot be large, but yet he is punished, and called upon to make the amplest restitution. Much more, does the teacher infer, will be the punishment, and equally certain, where adultery is in question, and the crime is of the most heinous character affecting the most precious interests, and indulged in from the lowest of motives. Men do not despise a thief, etc.; i.e. they do not condemn him under the circumstances, non grandis est culpa (Vulgate), \"the fault is not a great one;\" but they do despise an adulterer - him they hold in contempt as one \"who lacketh understanding\" and destroyeth his own soul (ver. 32). The verb buz has, however, been otherwise rendered as \"to overlook.\" Zockler and Holden explain, \"men do not overlook,\" though the former gives the literal sense as \"men do not despise.\" Gesenius renders \"despise,\" but explains, \"i.e. they do not let him go unpunished.\" Vatablus, the Versions, Ariae, Montani, and Munsteri, Hitzig, Delitzsch, and Gesenius, Stuart, Muenscher, and Wordsworth, all agree m regarding the proper meaning of the verb to be \"to despise\" or \"to treat scornfully.\" The verb buz, moreover, occurs in this sense in Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 11:12; Proverbs 13:13; Proverbs 14:21; Proverbs 23:9; and Song of Solomon 8:1, 7. Michaelis's explanation is as follows: \"although a theft is deservedly regarded as infamous in the commonwealth, nevertheless, if it be compared with adultery, it is less wicked.\" The rendering of the LXX., οὐ θαυμαστὸν ἐάν ἁλῷ τις κλέπτων, i.e. \"it is not a wonder if any thief be taken,\" it is difficult to reconcile with the text in the original, though it may be explained as expressing the certainty of arrest which follows theft, and thus gives colour to the secondary meaning attached to the verb, i.e. that of overlooking. The Syriac and Arabic Versions follow the LXX. while the Chaldee Paraphrase renders, \"It is not a matter of surprise if a thief steals,\" etc. His soul; Hebrew, naph'sko. Nephesh is used here for desire, craving, or appetite, as in Ecclesiastes 6:2, 7; Ezekiel 7:19. \"To satisfy his soul\" is \"to sustain his life.\" Anima, Vulgate; ψυχή, LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - But if he be taken, he shill restore sevenfold. Men do not despise the thief, but yet they apprehend him and insist on fullest restitution. Be found; i.e. seized (Delitzsch), or legally convicted (Gejerus). He shall restore; i.e. he must restore (Zockler). Delitzsch, however, understands the future, y'shalem, as potential, \"he may restore.\" Sevenfold; Hebrew, siv'athayim; LXX., ἐπταπλάσια; Vulgate, septulum. On this word Geier remarks, \"Haec vox nullibi in sacris ponitur pio numero definito;\" i.e. \"It is nowhere put in Scripture for a definite number.\" It is therefore to be understood indefinitely of complete restitution, or, as it is expressed in the second and parallel clauses, \"all the substance of his house.\" The word is used in this sense in Genesis 4:24; Leviticus 26:28; Job 5:19 (Lapide). Theft under the Mosaic Law was punishable by a fivefold, fourfold, and twofold restitution (Exodus 22:1-4, 9), and, in the event of this not forthcoming, the delinquent was to be sold into slavery (Leviticus 25:89). In 2 Samuel 12:6 a fourfold restitution is mentioned, and in the New Testament Zacchaeus promises to restore fourfold if he could be convicted of fraud (Luke 19:8). In the attempts to reconcile the \"sevenfold\" of our passage with the requirements of the Mosaic Law, Aben Ezra says that the combined penalties for two cases of theft are contemplated, and others that in the time of the writer the penalties had been increased. But proof of this is wanting. Grotius's explanation is more curious than correct, viz. that if the theft be repeated seven times, and he be \"taken\" seven times, the thief should only be punished by being forced to make restitution with some addition. Both the Greek and Roman law demanded a twofold restitution. Selden maintains that theft would have been subjected to the usual punishment (Selden, 'De Jure Not. et Gent.,' 6, 100, 6). We may therefore come to the conclusion that \"sevenfold\" is used in the sense indicated above. As to any objection which may be raised on the seem of inconsistency in talking of a man malting restitution, and giving all his substance when he steals to satisfy his hunger, it may be remarked that he need not necessarily be without substance of some sort or other, and he could acquire subsequently sufficient to satisfy the demand. On the question whether a person is justified by extreme want in stealing, see Grotius, 'De Jure Belli et Pacis,' 2, 100, 2, § 6; Puffendorf, 'De Jure Not. et Gent,' 2, 100, 6, § 5; Blackstone, 'Commentary,' 4:2 § 4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding. The adversative \"but\" is wanting in the original, but is clearly demanded by the contrast which is instituted. The man who steals from hunger has a motive for so doing, but the adulterer has no such excuse for his crime, which is an unwarrantable invasion of his neighbour's rights. Because there are honest ways for satisfying his desires, he therefore \"lacketh understanding.\" Committeth adultery with a woman; Hebrew, noeph ishshah; LXX., ὁ μοιχὸς; Vulgate, qui adulter est; i.e. an adulterer. The Hebrew naaph, \"to commit adultery,\" is here followed by an accusative, as in Leviticus 20:10 and Jeremiah 29:23. Lacketh understanding; Hebrew, khasar-lev; deficit corde. The verb khaser is \"to be devoid of anything,\" \"to lack.\" The expression, which occurs again in ch. Proverbs 7:7 aud Proverbs 9:4, refers to the brutish and stupid condition to which lust has reduced him. Lust has displaced right reason. He is expers judicii (Syriac), devoid of judgment, without intelligence, senseless and stupid. In modern phraseology, he has taken leave of his senses. Both the LXX. and Vulgate have combined the two branches of this verse, the former rendering, \"But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, compasses the loss of his life,\" and the latter, \"But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, loses his life.\" He that doeth it destroyeth his own soul; or literally, whoso will destroy his life he will do this, i.e. adultery. So Ariae Montani, Munsterus, Chaldee Targum. The man who commits adultery is a self-murderer. The phrase, mashkith naph'sho, corrumpens animam suam, may be resolved into the concrete \"a self-destroyer,\" as Delitzsch. The following verses seem to indicate that it is the temporal life which is referred to in nephesh, but the meaning of the term may be extended to embrace not only physical loss of life, but also moral and spiritual loss. By the Levitical Law adultery was punished by death: \"The man that committeth adultery with another man's wife ... the adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put to death\" (Leviticus 20:10; cf. Deuteronomy 22:22; John 8:4, 5; see also 1 Thessalonians 4:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. Two other things more immediate await the adulterer - personal chastisement and loss of reputation. It seems clear that \"a wound\" (Hebrew, negav, \"a stroke\" or \"blow\"), used here in the singular, collectively refers to the corporal punishment, which the outraged husband will inflict upon the adulterer (Delitzsch, Zockler. Lapide). (For the word, see Deuteronomy 17:8; 21:5.) It may also have reference to the punishment inflicted by the Law. In the LXX. the idea is expressed by ὁδύνας, i.e. \"pains,\" and so gives colour to Lapide's explanation of \"afflictions of every kind\" The Vulgate gives a moral turn to the meaning, and coordinates the word with \"dishonour:\" Turpitudinem et ignominiam congregat sibi, \"Dishonour is the ignominious treatment he will receive on all hands.\" The second part of the verse states that a brand of disgrace will be attached to his name which will be perpetual, not confined to this life only, but extending beyond it, so that men will never recall it but with this stigma (Patrick, Mercerus). On shall be ... wiped away (Hebrew, timmakeh, the niph. future of makhah, \"to wipe off, or away,\" and in hiph. \"to be blotted out,\" equivalent to the Latin delere), see Deuteronomy 25:6; Ezekiel 6:6; Judges 21:17. The LXX. renders ἐξαλειφθήσεται, and adds, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, \"forever.\" The statements of the verse are illustrated by Horace, 'Satires,' lib. 1:2, 37, who describes the dangers and mishaps which befall the adulterer and fornicator.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Hic se praecipitem tecto dedit; ille flagellisNEWLINEAd mortem caesus: fugiens hic decidit acremNEWLINEPraedonum in turbam: dedit hic pro corpore nnmmos.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. The first hemistich is adduced as a reason for what has preceded, while the concluding hemistich and the following and last verses are a deduction strengthening what has been stated before, and also showing that the punishment will be inevitable. The general consensus of commentators and texts is to connect the two hemistiches of this verse. Thus the LXX., Μεστὸς γὰρ ζήλου θυμὸς ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς οὐ φεισεται ἐν ἡμέρα κρίσεως, \"For the wrath of her husband filled with jealousy shall not spare in the day of judgment;\" the Vulgate, Quia zelus et furor viri non parcet in die vindictae, \"For the jealousy and rage of a man shall not spare in the day of vengeance;\" the Syriac, Nam quia furor mariti plenus est zelotypia non parcet in die retributionis, \"For because rage of a husband is full of jealousy he shall not spare in the day of retribution.\" So the Arabic, and the Tigarina Versio, and among the commentators Durandus. Dathe, Doderlein, Holden. But the Hebrew simply makes the statement, ki-kimah khamath-gaver, quia zelus excandescentia viri, i.e., as in the Authorized Version, \"for jealousy is the rage of a man,\" ki, equivalent to the Greek γὰρ, \"for\" and kinah is the subject of the sentence. The Hebrew kinah is \"jealousy\" as in Proverbs 27:4, \"Who is able to stand before envy?\" or, as margin, \"jealousy.\" The ordinary copulative verb \"is\" is best understood as connecting the subject and the predicate; \"the rage of a man,\" Hebrew kamath-gaver, as above, i.e. \"the glow of a man's anger\" (Delitzsch), or \"a man's fierce anger\" (Zockler). Jealousy awakens and inflames the wrath and anger of a man or husband to its highest pitch. It evokes the strongest feelings for revenge. Man; Hebrew, gaver, equivalent to ish, \"a man,\" in opposition to \"a wife\" - \"a husband,\" as here. The word is chiefly found in poetry. Its derivation, from gavar, \"to be strong,\" serves to bring out the idea also of the intensity or force of the jealousy - it burns or rages with all the might of the man. The latter part of the verse in the Hebrew is simply, \"and he will not spare (v'lo-yakh'mol) in the day of vengeance.\" The Authorized Version \"therefore\" serves to bring out the deduction, though it does net occur in the original. He will not spare; i.e. the injured husband will not show any clemency or mercy to the adulterer, the man who has wronged him so deeply. In the day of vengeance; Hebrew, b'yom nakam. The expression may refer to the time when the adulterer is brought before the judges, but more probably to every occasion on which the husband can exercise his vengeance. So Gejerus. For the expression, cf. Isaiah 34:8, \"The day of the Lord's vengeance;\" Job 20:28, \"The day of his wrath;\" and Proverbs 11:4, \"The day of wrath.\" Jealousy is implacable (see Song of Solomon 8:6, \"Jealousy is cruel as the grave\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs6:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. No recompense or atonement, nor any gifts however great, will buy him off. These are supposed to be offered by the adulterer to the enraged husband, who, however, will never rest till he effects the utter ruin of his injurer. The literal rendering of the first hemistich is, \"He will not accept the face of any ransom.\" The phrase nasa phanim, is equivalent to the Greek πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν, and signifies \"to give a favourable reception to the outward expression of any one.\" The figure is taken from lifting up the face of a suppliant, the radical meaning of the verb nasa being \"to take up,\" \"to lift up.\" The ransom; Hebrew, kopher (the word usually applied to designate the price of redemption, mulct, or line demanded for expiation of a crime; see Exodus 21:30; Exodus 30:12; Numbers 35:31, 32); here the bribe offered by the adulterer to be let off will be altogether rejected, however alluring, the word p'ney, \"face,\" carrying with it the idea of something recommendatory. For the expression, nasa phanim, cf. Genesis 19:21; Genesis 22:21; Job 13:10; Job 13:8; and Malachi 1:8. The LXX. rendering is, Οὐκ ἀνταλλάξεται οὐδενὸς λύτρου τὴν ἔχθραν, \"He will not commute for any redemption his enmity.\" Neither will he rest content; literally, and he will not be willing; Hebrew, v'lo-yoveh; LXX., οὐδὲ μὴ διαληθῇ, \"nor may it, i.e. his enmity, be dissolved or weakened.\" (On the verb avah, \"to consent to,\" or \"to be willing,\" see Proverbs 1:10.) Many gifts, each increasing in value, may be offered, but he will not be willing to forego his right of revenge. Though thou givest many gifts. It is noticeable that the address, which has been adapted to the third person, here becomes personal, and so takes up the form originally employed in vers. 20-25. A hypothetical case has been imagined in vers. 26-35, but still with the thought underlying it that it applies to the person addressed. \"Though thou givest many gifts,\" or more literally, \"though thou multipliest the gift,\" brings the matter homo to the young man. Gifts; Hebrew, shokad, \"the gift,\" is the word usually employed to designate the bribe offered to corrupt a judge (see Exodus 23:8; Deuteronomy 10:17; Deuteronomy 16:19; Deuteronomy 27:25; 1 Samuel 8:3). Here it refers to the money offered to free from punishment. The Vulgate gives the idea that these gifts or bribes are offered by a third party on behalf of the adulterer: Nec acquiescet cujusquam precibus, nec suscipiet pro redemptione dona plurima. On these two last verses Lange remarks, \"Just as little as the adulterer, taken in his adultery, is left unpunished by the injured husband, so little, yea, even less, wilt the spiritual adulterer remain unpunished of the Lord (1 Corinthians 3:17).\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-27. - 13. Thirteenth admonitory discourse, containing a warning against adultery, treated under a different aspect from previous exhortations, and strengthened by an example. In this chapter and the following a contrast is drawn between the adulteress and Wisdom. Verse 1. - My son, keep my words. The teacher enjoins his pupil, as in Proverbs 2:1, to observe the rules which he gives. Lay up, as a precious treasure (see on Proverbs 2:1 and 7). The LXX. adds here a distich which is not in the Hebrew or in any other version, and is not germane to the context, however excellent in itself: \"My son, honour the Lord, and thou shalt be strong, and beside him feat no other.\" With this we may compare Luke 12:5 and Isaiah 8:12, 13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Keep my commandments, and live (see on Proverbs 4:4). As the apple of thine eye; literally, the little man (ishon, diminutive of ish) of the eye; so called from the miniature reflection of objects seen in the pupil, specially of the person who looks into another's eye. It is a proverbial expression for anything particularly precious and liable to be injured unless guarded with scrupulous care (comp. Psalm 17:8, Zechariah 2:8). Similarly the Greeks called this organ κόρη, \"damsel\" or \"puppet,\" and the Latin, pupilla.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Bind them upon thy fingers. Wear my precepts like a ring on thy finger, so that they may go with thee, whatever thou takest in hand. Others think that the so called tephillin, or phylacteries, are meant. These were worn both on the hand and the forehead, and consisted of a leather box containing strips of parchment, on which were written four texts, viz. Exodus 13:1-10; Exodus 11-16; Deuteronomy 6:4-9; Deuteronomy 11:13-21. The box was attached to a leather strap wound seven times round the arm three times round the middle finger, and the remainder passed round the hand (see (Exodus 13:9, 16; Jeremiah 22:24). Write them upon the table of thine heart (see on Proverbs 3:3 and Proverbs 6:21; and comp. Deuteronomy 6:9).

Wisdom is personified, and the connection with her indicated by the relationship which best expresses love, purity, confidence. In the Book of Wisdom 8. she is represented as wife.

When the heart is filled with the love of what is good, it is armed against the seductions of evil pleasure or whatever may entice the soul from God and duty. Septuagint, \"That she (Wisdom) may keep thee from the strange and evil woman, if she should assail thee with gracious words.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor at the window of my house I looked through my casement,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-23. - To show the greatness of the danger presented by the seductions of the temptress, the writer introduces no mere abstraction, no mere personification of a quality, but an actual example of what had passed before his own eyes. Verse 6. - For. The particle introduces the example. At the window of my house. He gives a graphic delineation of a scene witnessed outside his house. I looked through my casement; eshnab, \"the lattice,\" which served the purpose of our Venetian blinds, excluding the sun, but letting the cool air pass into the room (comp. Judges 5:28). A person within could see all that passed in the street without being himself visible from without (Song of Solomon 2:9). The Septuagint reads the sentence as spoken of the woman: \"For from the window glancing out of her house into the streets, at one whom she might see of the senseless children, a young man void of understanding.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And beheld among the simple ones. Though it was night (ver. 9), there was light enough from moon or stars or from illuminated houses to show what was passing. \"The simple\" are the inexperienced, who are easily led astray (see on Proverbs 1:4). Looking forth into the street on the throng of young and thoughtless persons passing to and fro, among them I discerned... a young man void of understanding; a fool, who, without any deliberate intention of sinning, put himself in the way of temptation, played on the borders of transgression. The way of escape was before him, as it is in all temptations (1 Corinthians 10:13), but he would not take it. Such a one may well be said to lack understanding, or heart, as the Hebrew expresses it (Proverbs 6:32, where see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPassing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Near her corner.

Job 24:15). In the black and dark night; literally, in the pupil of the eye of night and in darkness. We have the same expression in Proverbs 20:20 (where see note) to denote midnight. Its appropriateness is derived from the fact that the pupil of the eye is the dark centre in the iris. Septuagint: the youth \"speaking in the darkness of evening, when there is the stillness of night and gloom.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And, behold, there met him a woman. His long watch is rewarded; the woman comes forth from her house into the street - a proceeding which would at once show what she was, especially in the East, where females are kept secluded, and never appear at night or unattended. With the attire of an harlot. There is no \"with\" in the original, \"woman\" and \"attire\" being in apposition: \"There met him a woman, a harlot's dress\" (shith, Psalm 73:6); her attire catches the eye at once, and identifies her (comp. Genesis 38:14). In Revelation 17:4 the harlot is \"arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls;\" and in the present case the female is dressed in some conspicuous garments, very different from the sober clothing of the pure and modest. Subtil of heart (נְצֻרַת לֵב); literally, of concealed heart; i.e. she hides her real feelings, feigning, perhaps, affection for a husband, or love for her paramour, while she seeks only to satisfy her evil passions. The versions have used a different reading. Thus the Septuagint: \"Who makes the hearts of young men flutter (ἐζίπτασθαι);\" Vulgate, praeparata ad capiendas animas, \"ready to catch souls.\" Vers. 11 and 12 describe the character and habits of this woman, not as she appeared on this occasion, but as she is known to the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - She is loud; boisterous, clamorous, as Proverbs 9:13. The description applies to a brute beast at certain periods. Stubborn; ungovernable, like an animal that will not bear the yoke (Hosea 4:16). Vulgate, garrula et vaga, \"talkative and unsettled;\" Septuagint, ἀνεπτερωμένη καὶ ἄσωτος, \"flighty and debauched.\" Her feet abide not in her house. She is the opposite of the careful, modest housewife, who stays at home and manages her family affairs (Titus 2:5). The Vulgate inserts another trait: quietis impatiens, \"always restless.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Now is she without, now in the streets. At one moment outside her own door, at another in the open street. Septuagint: \"At one time she roams without (ἔξω ῤέμβεται).\" The woman is represented not as a common prostitute, but as a licentious wife, who, in her unbridled lustfulness, acts the part of a harlot. Lieth in wait at every corner; seeking to entice some victim. Then the narrative proceeds; the writer returns to what he beheld on the occasion to which he refers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - So she caught him and kissed him; being utterly lost to shame, like Potiphar's wife (Genesis 39:12). With an impudent face said; literally, strengthened her face and said; put on a bold and brazen look to suit, the licentious words which she spoke. Wordsworth quotes the delineation of the \"strange woman\" drawn by St. Ambrose ('De Cain. et Abel.,' 1:4): \"Domi inquieta, in plateis vaga, osculis prodiga, pudore villis, amictu dives, genas picta; meretricio procax motu, infracto per delicias incessu, nutantibus oculis, et ludentibus jaculans palpebris retia, quibus pretiosas animus juveuum capit.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I have peace offerings with me. Shelamim, \"peace or thank offerings,\" were divided between Jehovah, the priests, and the offerer. Part of the appointed victim was consumed by fire; the breast and right shoulder were allotted to the priests; and the rest of the animal belonged to the person who made the offering, who was to eat it with his household on the same day as a solemn ceremonial feast (Leviticus 3; Leviticus 7). The adulteress says that certain offerings were due from her, and she had duly made them. This day have I payed my vows. And now (the day being reckoned from one night to the next) the feast was ready, and she invites her paramour to share it. The religious nature of the feast is utterly ignored or forgotten. The shameless woman uses the opportunity simply as a convenience for her sin. If, as is probable, the \"strange woman\" is a foreigner, she is one who only outwardly conforms to the Mosaic Law, but in her heart cleaves to the impure worship of her heathen hems And doubtless, in lax times, these religious festivals, even in the case of worshippers who were not influenced by idolatrous proclivities, degenerated into self-indulgence and excess. The early Christian agapae were thus misused (1 Corinthians 11:20, etc.); and in modern times religious anniversaries have too often become occasions of licence and debauchery, their solemn origin and pious uses being entirely thrust aside.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Therefore came I forth to meet thee. As though she would invite the youth to a pious rite, she speaks; she uses religion as a pretext for her proceedings, trying to blind his conscience and to gratify his vanity. Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee (see on Proverbs 1:28). She tries to persuade her dupe that he is the very lover for whom she was looking, whereas she was ready to take the first that offered. Spiritual writers see in this adulteress a type of the mystery of iniquity, or false doctrine, or the harlot described in Revelation (Revelation 2:20, etc.; Revelation 17:1, etc.; Revelation 18:9, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - She describes the preparation she has made for his entertainment. Coverings of tapestry; marbaddim, \"cushions,\" \"pillows.\" The expression occurs again in Proverbs 31:22. It is derived from דָבַד \"to spread,\" and means cushions spread out ready for use. The Septuagint has κειρίαις; Vulgate, funibus, \"cords.\" These versions seem to regard the word as denoting a kind of delicate sacking on which the coverlets were laid. Carved works, with fine linen of Egypt; literally, striped, or variegated, coverings, Egyptian linen. The words are in apposition, but the latter point to the material used, which is אֵטוּן, etun (ἅπαξ λεγόμενον), \"linen yarn or thread,\" hence equivalent to \"coverlets of Egyptian thread.\" This was of extreme fineness, costly, and much prized. By \"carved works\" (Hebrew, חֲטֻבות chatuboth) the Authorized Version must refer to bed poles or bed boards elaborately carved and polished; but the word is better taken of coverlets striped in different colours, which give the idea of richness and luxury. Vulgate, trapetibus pictis ex Aegypto, \"embroidered rugs of Egyptian work;\" Septuagint, ἀμφιτάποις τοῖς ἀπ Αἰγύπτου, \"shaggy cloth of Egypt.\" The mention of these articles denotes the foreign commerce of the Hebrews, and their appreciation of artistic work (comp. Isaiah 19:9; Ezekiel 27:7). The Prophet Amos (Amos 6:4) denounces those that \"lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. The substances mentioned were dissolved in or mixed with water, and then sprinkled on the couch. The love of such things is reckoned as a sign of luxury and vice (Isaiah 3:20, etc.). The three perfumes are mentioned together in Song of Solomon 4:14; \"myrrh, aloes, and cassia,\" in Psalm 45:8. Septuagint, \"I have sprinkled my couch with saffron, and my house with cinnamon.\" Myrrh is nowadays imported chiefly from Bombay, but it seems to be found in Arabia and on the coasts of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. It is a gummy substance exuding from the bark of the balsamodendron when wounded, and possessing an aromatic odour not particularly agreeable to modern tastes. It was one of the ingredients of the holy oil (Exodus 30:28), and was used in the purification of women (Esther 2:12), as well as in perfuming persons and things, and, mixed with aloes, in embalming dead bodies (John 19:39). Aloes is the inspissated juice of the leaves of the aloe, a leguminous plant growing in India, Cochin China, Abyssinia, and Socotra. The ancients used the dried root for aromatic purposes. It is mentioned by Balaam (Numbers 24:6). Cinnamon, which is the same word in Hebrew and Greek, is the fragrant bark of a tree growing in Ceylon and India and the east coast of Africa.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Let us take our fill of love; let us intoxicate ourselves (inebriemur, Vulgate); as though the reason were overthrown by sensual passion as much as by drunkenness. The bride in Song of Solomon 1:2 says, \"Thy love is better than, wine\" (see Proverbs 5:15, 19, and note there),NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The temptress proceeds to encourage the youth by showing that there is no fear of interruption or detection. The goodman is not at home. \"Goodman\" is an old word meaning \"master of the house,\" or husband (Matthew 20:11, etc.); but the Hebrew is simply \"the man,\" which is probably a contemptuous way of speaking of the husband whom she was outraging. He is gone a long journey; he has gone to a place at a great distance hence. This fact might assure her lover that he was safe from her husband's jealousy (Proverbs 6:34); but she has further encouragement to offer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He hath taken a bag of money with him; not only to defray the expenses of the journey (a fact which need not be dwelt upon), but because he has some pecuniary business to transact which will occupy his time, and prevent his return before the appointed hour. And will come home at the day appointed; better, as the Revised Version, he will come home at the full moor, (in die pleura lunae, Vulgate). כֶּסֶא here, and כֶּסֶה Psalm 81:4, are rightly translated \"the full moon,\" this rendering being supported by the Syriac keso, though the etymology is doubtful. As it has before been mentioned that the night was dark (ver. 9), it is plain that there were still many days to run before the moon was full, and the husband returned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thus far we have had the adulteress introduced speaking; now the narrative proceeds. With her much fair speech she caused him to yield. First, she influenced his mind, and bent his will to her purpose by her evil eloquence. The Hebrew word means \"doctrine, or learning\" - devil's pleading (Proverbs 1:5; Proverbs 9:9). St. Jerome has irretivit, \"she netted him;\" Septuagint, \"She caused him to go astray (ἀπεπλάνησε) by much converse.\" She talked him over, though indeed he had put himself in the way of temptation, and had now no power to resist her seductions. Then with the flattering of her lips she forced him; drew him away. His body followed the lead of his blinded mind; he acceded to her solicitations. Septuagint, \"With the snares of her lips she ran him aground (ἐξώκειλε), drove him headlong to ruin.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He teeth after her straightway; suddenly, as though, casting aside all scruples, he gave himself up to the temptation, and with no further delay accompanied her to the house. Septuagint, \"He followed, being cajoled (κεπφωθείς), ensnared like a silly bird\" (see the article on Cepphus Larus, in Erasmus's 'Adag ,' s.v. \"Garrulitas\"). As an ox goeth to the slaughter. He no more realizes the serious issue of his action than an irrational beast which, without prevision of the future, walks contentedly to the slaughter house, and is stupidly placid in the face of death. Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks. There is some difficulty in the translation of this clause. The Authorized Version, with which Delitzsch virtually agrees, is obtained by transposition of the nouns, the natural rendering of the Hebrew being \"as fetters to the correction of a fool.\" The sense thus obtained is obvious: the youth follows the woman, as a fool or a criminal is led unresisting to confinement and degradation. Doubtless there is some error in the text, as may be seen by comparison of the versions. Septuagint (with which the Syriac agrees), \"As a dog to chains, or as a hart struck to the liver with an arrow;\" Vulgate, \"As a frisking lamb, and not knowing that as a fool he is being dragged to bondage.\" The commentators are much divided. Fleischer, \"As if in fetters to the punishment of the fool,\" i.e. of himself; Ewald, \"As when a steel trap (springs up) for the correction of a fool,\" i.e. when a hidden trap suddenly catches an incautious person wandering where he has no business. The direct interpretation, that the youth follows the harlot, as fetters the proper punishment of fools, is unsatisfactory, because the parallelism leads us to expect a living being instead of \"fetters.\" We are constrained to fall back on the Authorized Version as exhibiting the best mode of reconstructing a corrupt text. The youth, with his insensate passion, is compared to the madman or idiot who is taken away, unconscious of his fate, to a shameful deprivation of liberty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTill a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Till a dart strike through his liver. This clause would be better taken with the preceding verse, as in the Septuagint, or else placed in a parenthesis; then the following clause introduces a new come parison. The youth follows the harlot till his liver, the seat of the passions, is thoroughly inflamed, or till fatal consequences ensue. Theocr., 'Id,' 11:15 -NEWLINENEWLINEἜχθιστον ἔχων ὑποκάρδιον ἕλκοςNEWLINEΚύπριος ἐκ μεγάλας τὸ οἱ ἥπατι πᾶξε βέλεμνον.NEWLINE\"Beneath his breastNEWLINEA hateful wound he bore by Cypris given,NEWLINEWho in his liver fixed the fatal dart.\" Delitzsch would relegate the hemistich to the end of the verse, making it denote the final result of mad and illicit love. The sense thus gained is satisfactory, but the alteration is quite arbitrary, and unsupported by ancient authority. As a bird hasteth to the snare. This is another comparison (see Proverbs 1:17, the first proverb in the book, and note there). And knoweth not that it is for his life; i.e. the infatuated youth does not consider that his life is at stake, that he is bringing upon himself, by his vicious rashness, temporal and spiritual ruin (Proverbs 5:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The narrative ends here, and the author makes a practical exhortation deduced from it. Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children. He began by addressing his words to one, \"my son\" (ver. 1); he here turns to the young generally, knowing how necessary is his warning to all strong in passion, weak in will, wanting in experience. The Septuagint has \"my son,\" as in ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Let not thine heart decline to her ways. The verb satah is used in Proverbs 4:15 (where see note) of turning aside from evil; but here, as Delitzsch notes, it is especially appropriate to the case of a faithless wife whose transgression, or declension from virtue, is described by this term (Numbers 5:12). Go not astray in her paths. The LXX. (in most manuscripts) has only one rendering for the two clauses: \"Let not thine heart incline unto her ways.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For she hath east down many wounded. Delitzsch, \"For many are the slain whom she hath caused to fall.\" The harlot marks her course with ruined souls, as a ruthless conqueror leaves a field of battle strewn with corpses. Yea, many strong (atsum) men have been slain by her. One thinks of Samson and David and Solomon, the victims of illicit love, and suffering for it. Vulgate, et fortissimi quique interfecti sunt ab ea. But the Septuagint and many moderns take atsum in the sense of \"numerous,\" as Psalm 35:18; ἀναρίθμητοι, \"innumerable are her slain,\" The former interpretation seems preferable, and avoids tautology.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Her house is the way to hell (sheol). A warning fontal in Proverbs 2:18 and Proverbs 5:5. Viae inferi domus ejus. The plural דַּרְכֵי is well expressed by Hitzig: \"Her house forms a multiplicity of ways to hell.\" Manifold are the ways of destruction to which adultery leads; but they all look to one awful end. Going down to the chambers of death. Once entangled in the toils of the temptress, the victim may pass through many stages, but he ends finally in the lowest depth - destruction of body and soul Spiritual writers see here an adumbration of the seductions of false doctrine, and the late to which it brings all who by it are led astray.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-36. - 14. Fourteenth admonitory discourse concerning Wisdom - her excellence, her origin, her gifts. She is contrasted with the strange woman of ch. 7, and the exceeding greatness of the blessings which she offers exhibits in the most marked manner the nothingness of the deceiver's gifts. One is reminded of the celebrated episode of the choice of Hercules, delineated by Xenophon, 'Memorab.,' 2:1. 21, etc. The chapter divides itself into four sections.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Introductory (vers. 1-3); Wisdom calls on all to listen, and gives reasons for trusting to her (vers. 4-11).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) She displays her excellence (vers. 12-21).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) She discourses of her origin and action (vers. 22-31).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) She again inculcates the duty of hearkening to her instructions (vers. 32-36). Verse 1. - Doth not Wisdom cry? (see on Proverbs 1:20, and Introduction). The interrogative form, which expects an affirmative answer, is a mode of asserting a truth universally allowed. Wisdom is personified, though we are not so plainly confronted by an individual, as in the preceding case of the harlot. But it must be remembered that, whatever may have been the author's exact meaning, however worldly a view the original enunciation may have afforded, we, reading these chapters by the light cast upon them by later revelation, see m the description of Wisdom no mere ideal of practical prudence and good sense, no mere poetic personification of an abstract quality, but an adumbration of him who is the Wisdom of God, the coeternal Son of the Father. The open, bold, and public utterances of Wisdom are in happy contrast to the secret and stealthy enticements of Vice. So Christ, the true Wisdom, says, \"I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing\" (John 18:20). The Septuagint changes the subject of this verse, and makes the pupil addressed: \"Thou shalt proclaim (κηρύξεις) wisdom, that understanding (φρόνησις) may obey thee;\" which seems to mean that, if you wish to acquire wisdom, so that it may serve you practically, you must act as a herald or preacher, and make your desire generally known. St. Gregory has some remarks about wilful ignorance of what is right. \"It is one thing,\" he says, \"to be ignorant; another to have refused to learn. For not to know is only ignorance; to refuse to learn is pride. And they are the less able to plead ignorance in excuse, the more that knowledge is set before them, even against their will. We might, perhaps, be able to pass along the way of this present life in ignorance of this Wisdom, if she herself had not steed in the corners of the way\" ('Moral.,' 25:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - She standeth in the top of high places, by the way. She takes her stand, not in thievish corners of the streets, like the harlot, but in the most open and elevated parts of the city, where she may be best seen and heard by all who pass by (see Proverbs 1:21, and note there). In the places of the paths; i.e. where many paths converge, and where people meet from different quarters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The expressions in the text indicate the position which she takes and its capabilities. At the hand of the gates (1 Samuel 19:3). She posts herself at the side of the city gates, under the archway pierced in the wall, where she is sure of an audience. At the mouth of the city, inside the gate, where people pass on their way to the country. At the coming in at the doors, by which persons enter the town. Thus she catches all comers, those who are entering, as well as those who are leaving the city. Here standing, as in the Agora or Forum, she crieth; she calls aloud, saying what follows (vers. 4-36). It is a fine picture of the comprehensiveness of the gospel, which is meant for high and low, prince and peasant; which is proclaimed everywhere, in the courts of kings, in the lanes of the country, in the hovels of the city; which sets forth the infinite love of God, who is not willing that any should perish, but would have all men come to the knowledge of the truth (2 Peter 3:9). Septuagint, \"By the gates of the mighty she sits, in the entrances she sings aloud (ὑμνεῖται).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-11. - She summons various classes of persons to attend to her, showing how trustworthy she is, and how precious her instruction. Verse 4. - Unto you, O men, I call. \"Men,\" ishim (אִישִׁים); equivalent to ἄνδρες, viri, men in the highest sense, who have some wisdom and experience, but need further enlightenment (Isaiah 53:3; Psalm 141:4). The sons of man; בְּנֵי אָדָם, \"children of Adam;\" equivalent to ἄνθρωποι, homines, the general kind of men, who are taken up with material interests. St. Gregory notes ('Moral ,' 27:6) that persons (heroines) of perfect life are in Scripture sometimes called \"men\" (viri). And again, \"Scripture is wont to call those persons 'men' who follow the ways of the Lord with firm and steady steps. Whence Wisdom says in the Proverbs, 'Unto you, O men, I call.' As if she were saying openly, 'I do not speak to women, but to men; because they who are of an unstable mind cannot at all understand my words'\" ('Moral.,' 28:12, Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - O ye simple, understand wisdom. \"The simple,\" those not yet perverted, but easily influenced for good or evil. See on Proverbs 1:4, where also is explained the word ormah, used here for \"wisdom;\" equivalent to calliditas in a good sense, or πανουργία, as sometimes employed in the Septuagint; so here: νοήσατε ἄκακοι πανουργίαν, \"subtlety.\" Ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. For \"fools\" (khesilim), the intellectually heavy and dull, see on Proverbs 1:22. The heart is considered the seat of the mind or understanding (comp. Proverbs 15:32; Proverbs 17:16, etc.). Septuagint, \"Ye that are untaught, take in heart (ἔνθεσθε καρδίαν).\" The call thus addressed to various classes of parsons is like the section in 1 John 2, \"I write unto you. little children,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will speak of excellent things; de rebus magnis, Vulgate; σεμνὰ γὰρ ἐρῶ, Septuagint. The Hebrew nagid is elsewhere used of persons; e.g. a prince, leader (1 Samuel 9:16; 1 Chronicles 26:24); so it may here be best translated \"princely,\" \"noble\" - an epithet which the subject matter of Wisdom's discourse fully confirms (comp. Proverbs 22:20, though the word there is different). Hitzig and others, following the Syriac, prefer the meaning, \"plain, evident truths\" (comp. ver. 9); but the former interpretation is most suitable. The opening of my lips shall be right things. That which I announce when I open my mouth is just and right (Proverbs 23:16). Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Another coordinate reason for attention. My mouth; chek, \"palate\" (Proverbs 5:3, where see note); the organ of speech. Shall speak truth; emeth (see on Proverbs 3:3). The verb הָגָה (hagah) properly means \"to speak with one's self,\" \"to meditate;\" and so the versions translate here, meditabitur, μελετήσει; but this idea is not appropriate to the word joined with it, \"the palate,\" and it must be taken to signify to utter, as in Psalm 35:28; Psalm 37:30, etc. Wickedness is an abomination to my lips. Resha, \"wickedness,\" is the contrary of moral truth and right. Septuagint, \"False lips are abominable in my sight.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In righteousness; i.e. joined with righteousness equivalent to \"righteous.\" In Proverbs 3:16 the Septuagint has an addition which may perhaps be an echo of this passage: \"Out of her mouth proceedeth righteousness, and she beareth upon her tongue law and mercy.\" But more probably it is derived partly from Isaiah 45:23, and partly from Proverbs 31:26. There is nothing froward or perverse in them. In the utterance of Wisdom there is nothing crooked, no distortion of the truth; all is straightforward and direct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They are all plain to him that understandeth. The man who listens to and imbibes the teaching of Wisdom finds these words intelligible, and \"to the point.\" Opening his heart to receive Divine instruction, he is rewarded by having his understanding enlightened; for while \"the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God\" (1 Corinthians 2:14), yet \"the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him\" (Psalm 25:14), and \"mysteries are revealed unto the meek\" (Ecclus. 3:19, Complutensian אָ). Right to them that find knowledge (ver. 10). They form an even path without stumbling blocks for those who have learned to discern right from wrong, and are seeking to direct their lives in accordance with high motives. Septuagint, \"They are all present (ἐνώπια) to those that understand, and right (ὀρθὰ) to those that find knowledge.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReceive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Receive my instruction, and not silver; i.e. acquire wisdom rather than silver, if ever the choice is yours. And knowledge rather than choice gold (comp. ver. 19; Proverbs 3:140. (For \"knowledge,\" daath, see on Proverbs 2:10.) The comparison is implied rather than expressed in the first clause, while it is made clear in the second. Thus Hosea 6:6, \"I desired mercy, and not sacrifice,\" the second matter mentioned being, not necessarily of no importance, but always in such cases of inferior importance to the other. We may quote Horace's complaint of the worldliness of his countrymen, a marked contrast to the inspired counsel of Proverbs ('Epist.,' 1:1, 52) -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Villus argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.NEWLINEO cives, cives! quaerenda pecunia primum est,NEWLINEVirtus post nummos.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - (See Proverbs 3:14, 15, and notes.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12-21. - Wisdom tells of her own excellence. Verse 12. - I wisdom dwell with prudence; rather, as in the Revised Version, I have made subtilty (ver. 5) my dwelling. Wisdom inhabits prudence, animates and possesses that cleverness and tact which is needed for the practical purposes of life. So the Lord is said to \"inhabit eternity\" (Isaiah 57:15). Septuagint, \"I wisdom dwelt (κατεσκήνωσα) in counsel and knowledge,\" which recalls, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt (ἐσκήνωσεν) among us\" (John 1:14). In 1 Timothy 6:16 we find the expression, \"Who alone hath (μόνος ἔχων) immortality,\" exchanged with the phrase, \"Who dwelleth (οἰκῶν) in the unapproachable light.\" And find out knowledge of witty inventions. This rendering refers to the production and solution of dark sayings which Wisdom effects. But the expression is better rendered, \"knowledge of deeds of discretion\" (ch. 1:4), or \"of right counsels,\" and it signifies that Wisdom presides over all well considered designs, that they are not beyond her sphere, and that she has and uses the knowledge of them. Septuagint, \"I (ἐγὼ) called upon understanding,\" i.e. it is I who inspire all good and righteous thought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The fear of the Lord is to hate evil. Wisdom here enunciates the proposition which is the foundation of all her teaching, only here, as it were, on the reverse side, net as the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 9:10), but as the hatred of evil; she then proceeds to particularize the evil which the Lord hates. Taking the clause in this sense, we have no need to alter the persons and forms of the verbs to \"I fear the Lord, I hate evil,\" as Dathe and others suggest; still less to suppress the whole paragraph as a late insertion. These violent measures are arbitrary and quite unnecessary, the present text allowing a natural and sufficient exposition. There can be no fellowship between light and darkness; he who serves the Lord must renounce the works of the devil. Pride and arrogancy, which are opposed to the sovereign virtue of humility, are the first sins which Wisdom names. These are among the things which the Lord is said to hate (Proverbs 6:17, etc.). \"Initium omnis peccati est superbia\" (Ecclus. 10:15, Vet. Lat.). The evil way; i.e. sins of conduct, \"way\" being, as commonly, equivalent to \"manner of life.\" The froward mouth; literally, mouth of perverseness, sins of speech (see on Proverbs 2:12; and comp. 10:31); Vulgate, os bilingue.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCounsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Having said what she hates, Wisdom now says what she is, and what she can bestow on her followers. Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom. There is some doubt about the meaning of the word translated \"sound wisdom\" (tushiyyah). The Vulgate has aequitas; the Septuagint, ἀσφάλεια, \"safety.\" The word occurs elsewhere in this book and in Job, but only in two other places of Scripture, viz. Isaiah 28:29 and Micah 6:9. It means properly \"elevation\" or \"furtherance,\" or, as others say, \"substance;\" and then that which is essentially good end useful, which may be wisdom, aid, or security (see on Proverbs 2:7). Wisdom affirms that she possesses counsel and all that can help forward righteousness; see Job 12:13, 16, passages very similar to the present (comp. Wisd. 8:9, etc.). I am understanding. Wisdom does not merely possess these attributes; they are her very nature, as it is said, \"God is love\" St. Jerome's mea est prudentia, and the LXX.'s ἐμὴ φρόνησις, lose this trait. I have strength. Wisdom directs the energies and powers of her pupils, which without her control would be spent wrongly or uselessly (comp. Ecclesiastes 7:19). Wisdom, understanding, and might are named among the seven gifts of the Spirit in Isaiah 11:2; and we may see in the passage generally an adumbration of him who is called \"Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God\" (Isaiah 9:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy me kings reign, and princes decree justice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - By me kings reign. By possession of wisdom kings are enabled to discharge their functions duly and righteously. So Solomon prayed for wisdom to enable him to rule his subjects properly (1 Kings 3:9; Wisd. 9:4). Princes (rozenim, Proverbs 31:4); either those who are weighty, inflexible, or these who weigh causes; the latter explanation seems most suitable. Vulgate, legum conditores; Septuagint, οἱ δυνάσται, These are said to decree justice; literally, to engrave just decrees on tablets; γράφουσι δικαιοσύνην, Septuagint. Early expositors take these words as spoken by Christ, to whom they are very plainly applicable (comp. Isaiah 32:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Princes; here sarim, \"leaders.\" All the judges of the earth. These words stand without a conjunction, in apposition to what has preceded, by what is called asyndeton summativum (Proverbs 1:21), and gather in one view kings, princes, and leaders. Thus the Book of Wisdom, which speaks of the duties of rulers, commences by addressing of κρίνοντες τὴν γῆν, \"ye that are judges of the earth.\" In the East judgment of causes was an integral part of a monarch's duties. The reading of the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint, which gives κρατοῦσι γῆς. The Vulgate, Syriac, and Chaldee road, צדק, \"justice,\" in place of ארצ, \"earth;\" but this seems to have been an alteration of the original text derived from some idea of the assertion there made being too comprehensive or universal. Nowack compares Psalm 2:10 and Psalms 148:11, \"Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth.\" The Fathers have taken these verses as spoken by God, and as asserting his supremacy and the providential ordering of human government, according to St. Paul's saying, \"There is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God\" (Romans 13:1; see St. Augustine, 'De Civit. Dei,' 5:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I love them that love me. So Christ says (John 14:21), \"He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him\" Love attracts love. \"Magues amoris est amor.\" They who love virtue and wisdom are regarded with favour by God. whoso inspiration they have obeyed, obtaining grace for grace. So Ben Sira says, \"Them that love her the Lord doth love \"(Ecclus. 4:14); so Wisd. 7:28, \"God loveth none but him that dwelleth with Wisdom.\" The Septuagint changes the verbs in this clause, though they are parts of the same word in the Hebrew: Ἐγὼ τοὺς ἐμὲ φιλοῦντας ἀγαπῶ. This reminds one of the passage in the last chapter of St. John (John 21:15-17). where a similar interchange is made. Those that seek me early shall find me (see the contrast in Proverbs 1:28). \"Early\" may mean from tender years; but more probably it is equivalent to \"earnestly,\" \"strenuously,\" as people deeply interested in any pursuit rise betimes to set about the necessary work (comp. Isaiah 26:9; Hosea 5:15). The Septuagint, \"They who seek (ζητοῦντες) me shall find.\" So the Lord says (Matthew 7:7), \"Seek (ζητεῖτε), and ye shall find;\" Ecclus. 4:12, \"He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to her early (οἱ ὀρθρίζοντες πρὸς αὐτὴν) shall be filled with joy\" (comp. Luke 21:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRiches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Riches and honour are with me (see Proverbs 3:16). Wisdom has these things in her possession to bestow on whom she will, as God gave them to Solomon in reward of his petition for wisdom (1 Kings 3:13). Durable riches and righteousness. Things often regarded as incompatible. Durable, עָתֵק (athek), occurs only here (but see Isaiah 23:18), and means \"old,\" \"venerable,\" \"long accumulated;\" hence firm and lasting. Righteousness is the last reward that Wisdom bestows, without which, indeed, all material blessings would be nothing worth. Wealth obtained in a right way, and rightly used, is durable and stable. This was especially true under a temporal dispensation. We Christians, however, look not for reward in uncertain riches, but in God's favour here and happiness in another world. The Septuagint, \"Possession of many things, and righteousness.\" What is denoted by \"righteousness\" is further explained in the following verses, 19-21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - My fruit is better than gold. We have had Wisdom called \"a tree of life\" (Proverbs 3:18), and the gain from possessing her compared to gold and silver (Proverbs 3:14). Fine gold (paz); Septuagint and Vulgate, \"precious stone.\" The word signifies \"purified gold\" - gold from which all mixture or alloy has been separated. My revenue; Vulgate, genimina mea; Septuagint, γεννήματα; Hebrew, tebuah, \"produce,\" \"profits.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I lead in the way (better, I walk in the way) of righteousness. I act always according to the rules of justice. In the midst of the paths of judgment. I swerve not to one side or the other (Proverbs 4:27). So the psalmist prays, \"Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end;\" \"Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk\" (Psalm 119:33; Psalm 143:8). And the promise is given to the faithful in Isaiah 30:21, \"Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.\" Virtue, as Aristotle has taught us, is the mean between two extremes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; יֵשׁ (yesh), ὕπαρξις, \"real, valuable possessions.\" Those who love Wisdom will walk in her path, follow her leading, and therefore, doing God's will, will be blessed with success. Such will lay up treasure in heaven, will provide bags which wax not old, will be preparing for \"an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away\" (Matthew 6:20; Luke 12:33; 1 Peter 1:4). The LXX. here inserts a paragraph as a kind of introduction to the important section which follows: \"If I declare unto you the things which daily befall, I will remember to recount the things of eternity;\" i.e. thus far I have spoken of the advantages derived from Wisdom in daily circumstances; now I proceed to narrate her origin and her doings from all eternity. But the addition appears awkward, and is probably not now in its original position.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-31. - Wisdom speaks of her origin, her active operations, the part which she bore in the creation of the universe, her relation to God (see on Proverbs 1:20 and Proverbs 3:19, and Introduction). It is impossible to decide what was the exact view of the writer with regard to the wisdom of which he speaks so eloquently; but there can be no doubt that he was guided in his diction so as to give expression to the idea of him whom St. John calls the Word of God. The language used is not applicable to an impersonal quality, an abstract faculty of God. It describes the nature and office of a Person; and who that Person is we learn from the later Scriptures, which speak of Christ as the \"Wisdom of God\" (Luke 11:49) and \"the Power of God and the Wisdom of God\" (1 Corinthians 1:24). If we confine our inquiry to the question - What was in the mind of the author when he indited this wonderful section concerning Wisdom? we shall fail to apprehend its true significance, and shall be disowning the influence of the Holy Spirit, which inspires all Scripture, which prompted the holy men who spake to utter words of which they knew not the full spiritual significance, and which could only be understood by subsequent revelation. There is, then, nothing forced or incongruous in seeing in this episode a portraiture of the Second Person of the blessed Trinity, the essential Wisdom of God personified, the Logos of later books, and of the gospel. This interpretation obtained universally in the Church in the earliest times, and has commended itself to the most learned and reverent of modern commentators. That much which was contained in their own utterances was unknown to the prophets of old, that they did not fully perceive the mysteries which they darkly enunciated, we learn from St. Peter, who tells us that they who prophesied of the grace of Christ sought and searched diligently what the Spirit of God that was in them did point unto, and were shown that not unto themselves, but unto us, they ministered those things, secrets which angels themselves desire to look into (1 Peter 1:10, etc.). Wisdom as a human endowment, animating all intellectual and even physical powers; Wisdom as communicating to man moral excellence and piety; Wisdom as not only an attribute of God, but itself as the eternal thought of God; - under these aspects it is regarded in our book; but under and through all it is more or less personified. Khochmah is contrasted in the next chapter, not with an abstraction, but with an actual woman of impure life - a real, not an imaginary, antagonist. The personality of the latter intimates that of the former (see Liddon, 'Bampt. Lects.,' 2.). Verse 22. - The Lord possessed me. Great controversy has arisen about the word rendered \"possessed.\" The verb used is קָנָה (kanah), which means properly \"to erect, set upright,\" also \"to found, form\" (Genesis 14:19, 22), then \"to acquire\" (Proverbs 1:5; Proverbs 4:5, 7, etc.) or \"to possess\" (Proverbs 15:32; Proverbs 19:8). The Vulgate, Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus, Venetian, give \"possessed;\" Septuagint, ἔκτισε, \"made,\" and so Syriac. The Arians took the word in the sense of \"created\" (which, though supported by the LXX., it seems never to have had), and deduced therefrom the Son's inferiority to the Father - that he was made, not begotten from all eternity. Ben Sira more than once employs the verb κτίζω in speaking of Wisdom's origin; e.g. Ecclus. 1:4, 9 Ecclus. 24:8. Opposing the heresy of the Arians, the Fathers generally adopted the rendering ἐκτήσατο, possedit, \"possessed;\" and even those who received the translation ἔκτισε, explained it not of creating, but of appointing, thus: The Father set Wisdom over all created things, or made Wisdom to be the efficient cause of his creatures (Revelation 3:14). May we not say that the writer was guided to use a word which would express relation in a twofold sense? Wisdom is regarded either as the mind of God expressed in operation, or the Second Person of the Holy Trinity; and the verb thus signifies that God possesses in himself this essential Wisdom, and intimates likewise that Wisdom by eternal generation is a Divine Personality. St. John (John 1:1), before saying that the Word was God, affirms that \"the Word was with God (ὁ Λόγος η΅ν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν).\" So we may assert that Solomon has arrived at the truth that Wisdom was πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, if he has left it for later revelation to declare that ἡ Σοφία or ὁ Λόγος Θεὸς η΅ν. Whichever sense we assign to the verb on which the difficulty is supposed to hang, whether we take it as \"possessed,\" \"formed,\" or \"acquired,\" we may safely assume that the idea conveyed to Christian minds is this - that Wisdom, existing eternally in the Godhead, was said to be \"formed\" or \"brought forth\" when it operated in creation, and when it assumed human nature. In the beginning of his way. So the Vulgate, in initio viarum suarum. But the preposition \"in\" does not occur in the original; and the words may be bettor translated, \"as the beginning of his way\" (Septuagint, ἔκτισέ με ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ); i.e. as the earliest revelation of his working. Wisdom, eternal and uncreated, first puts forth its energy in creation, then becomes incarnate, and is now called, \"the Firstborn of all creation (πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως)\" (Colossians 1:15). Thus in Psalm 2:7, \"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee\" (Hebrews 1:5); and, \"When he bringeth in the Firstborn into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him\" (Hebrews 1:6). In the present clause, the ways of God are his works, as in Job 26:14 and Job 40:19, where behemoth is called \"chief among the ways of God\" (comp. Psalm 145:17, where \"ways\" stands as a parallel to \"works\"). Before his works of old. These words are better regarded (with Delitzsch) as a second parallel object, קֶדֶם (kedem), translated \"before,\" being not a preposition, but denoting previous existence. Hence we translate, \"The foremost of his works of old;\" i.e. the earliest revelation of his energy. There is a curious passage in the 'Book of Enoch,' ch. 42, which speaks of the personality and pre-existence of Wisdom, of her desire to dwell among men, frustrated by man's wickedness: \"Wisdom found no place where she could dwell; therefore was her dwelling in heaven. Wisdom came forth in order to dwell among the sons of men, and found no habitation; then she returned to her place, and took her seat among the angels.\" We may add Wisd. 8:3, \"In that she dwelleth with God (συμβίωσιν Θεοῦ ἔχουσα), she magnifieth her nobility.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I was set up from everlasting. The verb used here is remarkable. It is נָסַך(nasak), in niph.; and it is found in Psalm 2:6, \"I have set my King upon my holy hill.\" Both here and there it has been translated \"anointed,\" which would make a noteworthy reference to Christ. But there seems no proof that the word has this meaning. It signifies properly \"to pour forth\" (as of molten metal), then \"to put down,\" \"to appoint or establish.\" The versions recognize this. Thus the Septuagint, \"he established (ἐθεμελίωσε) me;\" Vulgate, ordinata sum; Aquila, κατεστάθην; Symmachus, προεχείρισμαι; Venetian, κέχυμαι (comp. Ecclus. 1:9). So what is here said is that Wisdom was from everlasting exalted as ruler and disposer of all things. To express eternal relation, three synonymous terms are used. From everlasting; πρὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος, Septuagint, as Delitzsch notes, points back to infinite distance. From the beginning; i.e. before the world was begun to be made; as St. John says (John 1:1), \"In the beginning was the Word;\" and Christ prays, \"Glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was\" (John 17:5). Or ever the earth was. This looks to the most remote time after the actual creation, while the earth was being formed and adapted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The preexistence of Wisdom is still more expressly set forth. When there were no depths (vers. 27, 28). The waste of waters which covered the face of the earth is meant - that great deep on which primeval darkness brooded (Genesis 1:2). Before even this, man's earliest conception of the beginning of the world, uncreated Wisdom was. Septuagint, \"before he made the abysses\" (see on Proverbs 3:20). I was brought forth; Vulgate, et ego jam concepta eram; Septuagint, at the end of ver. 25, γεννᾷ με, \"he begetteth me.\" The verb here is חוּל (chul), which is used of the travailing of women, and is rightly translated, \"brought forth by generation.\" It indicates in this place the energizing of Wisdom, her conception in the Divine mind, and her putting tbrth in operation. When there were no fountains abounding with water; i.e. springs in the interior of the earth (Genesis 7:11; comp. Job 22, 26, 38.). Septuagint,\"Before the springs of the waters came forward (προελθεῖν).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Before the mountains were settled (Job 38:6). It is questioned where the mountains were supposed to be fixed, and some have thought that they are represented as fixed in the depths of the earth. But, as we learn from Genesis 1:9, they are regarded as rising from the waters, their foundations are laid in the great deep. So the psalmist, speaking of the waters, says, \"They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hast founded for them\" (Psalm 104:8; comp. Psalm 24:2). What is here affirmed of Wisdom is said of Jehovah in Psalm 90:2, \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.\" Verse 26. - The earth, nor the fields. The distinction intended is land as cultivated and occupied by buildings, etc., and waste uncultivated land outside towns. Septuagint, \"The Lord made countries and uninhabited places (ἀοικήτους);\" Vulgate, Adhuc terram non fecerat, et flumina. Hebrew, chutsoth; things without, abroad, hence open country. The Vulgate rendering, and that of Aquila and Symmaehus, ἐξόδους, are plainly erroneous, as waters have already been mentioned (ver. 24). The highest part of the dust of the world; literally, the head of the dusts of the world. Some have interpreted this expression of \"man,\" the chief of those creatures which are made of the dust of the ground (Genesis 3:19; Ecclesiastes 3:20). But the idea comes in awkwardly here; it is not natural to introduce man amid the inanimate works of nature, or to use such an enigmatical designation for him. St. Jerome has, cardines orbis terrarum, \"the world's hinges;\" Septuagint, \"the inhabited summits of the earth beneath the heavens; according to St. Hilary ('De Trinit.,' 12), \"cacumina quae habitantur sub coelo.\" Others take the term to signify the capes or promontories ot the world, the peaks and elevations; others, the clods of dry, amble land, in contrast to the untilled waste of waters; others, the chief elements, the matter of which the earth is composed. This last interpretation would lead us back to a period which has already been passed. Amid the many possible explanations, it is perhaps best (with Delitzsch, Nowack, etc.) to take rosh, \"head\" as equivalent to \"sum,\" \"mass,\" as in Psalm 139:17. \"How great is the sum (rosh) of them!\" Then the expression comprehensively means all the mass of earth's dust.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - After asserting the pre-existence of Wisdom, the writer tells her part in the work of creation. When he prepared the heavens, I was there. When God made the firmament, and divided the waters above it and below (Genesis 1:7), Wisdom cooperated. When he set a compass upon the face of the depth. חוּג (chug), \"circle,\" or \"circuit\" (as Job 22:14), means the vault of heaven, conceived of as resting on the ocean which surrounds the earth, in partial accordance with the notion in Homer, who speaks of the streams of ocean flowing back into itself (ἀψόῥῤοος), 'Iliad,' 18:399; 'Odyssey,' 10:508, etc. That the reference is not to the marking out a limit for the waters is plain from the consideration that this interpretation would make the verse identical with ver. 29. Thus in Isaiah 40:22 we have, \"It is he that sitteth above the circle (chug) of the earth;\" i.e. the vault of heaven that encircles the earth. Septuagint, \"When he marked out (ἀφώριζε) his throne upon the winds.\" The translators have referred tchom, \"depth,\" to the waters above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - When he established the clouds above. The reference is to the waters above the firmament (Genesis 1:7), which are suspended in the ether; and the idea is that God thus made this medium capable of sustaining them. Vulgate, Quando aethera firmabat sursum; Septuagint, \"When he made strong the clouds above\" (comp. Job 26:8). When he strengthened the fountains of the deep; rather, as in the Revised Version, when the fountains of the deep became strong; i.e. when the great deep (Genesis 7:11) burst forth with power (comp. Job 38:16). The Septuagint anticipates the following details by here rendering, \"When he made secure the fountains of the earth beneath the heaven.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - When he gave to the sea his decree (chok, as Job 28:26; Jeremiah 5:22); or, its bounds. The meaning is much the same in either case, being what is expressed in Job 38:8, etc,, \"Who shut up the sea with doors...and prescribed for it my decree, and set bars and doors, and said, Hitherto shall thou come, and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?\" The LXX. omits this hemistich. When he appointed the foundations of the earth. Job 38:4, \"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?... Who determined the measures thereof? or who stretched the line upon it? Wherein were the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the cornerstone thereof?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Then I was by him. Wisd. 9:9, \"Wisdom was with thee; which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world.\" So John 1:2, \"The Word was with God.\" As one brought up with him; Vulgate, cuncta componens; Septuagint, Ημην παρ αὐτῷ ἁρμόζουσα, \"I was with him arranging things in harmony.\" The Hebrew word is אָמון (amon), \"an artificer,\" \"workman\" (Jeremiah 52:15). Thus in Wisd. 7:22 Wisdom is called ἡ πάντων τεχνῖτις, \"the worker of all things.\" The Authorized Version takes the word in a passive state, as equivalent to alumnus, \"foster child.\" and this interpretation is etymologically admissible, and may possibly, as Schultens suggests, be glanced at in St. John's expression (John 1:18), \"the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.\" But as the point here is the creative energy of Wisdom, it is best to take the term as denoting \"artificer.\" It will then accord with the expression δημιουργὸς, applied by the Fathers to the Word of God, by whom all things were made (Ephesians 3:9, Textus Receptus, and Hebrews 1:2). And I was daily his delight; literally, I was delights day by day, which may mean either as in Authorized Version, or \"I had delight continually,\" i.e. it may signifyNEWLINENEWLINE(1) either that God took pleasure in the wisdom which displayed his workmanship, saw that it was very good (Genesis 1:4, etc.), looked with delight on the beloved Son in whom he was well pleased (Matthew 3:17, etc.); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it may mean that Wisdom herself rejoiced in her power and her work, rejoiced in giving effect to the Creator's idea, and so \"founding the earth\" (Proverbs 3:19). Vulgate, delectabar per singulos dies. The Septuagint adopts the former of these views, \"I was that wherein he took delight.\" But the second interpretation seems most suitable, as the paragraph is stating rather what Wisdom is in herself than what she was in the eyes of Jehovah. What follows is a parallel. Rejoicing always before him; Vulgate, ludens coram eo omni tempore, as though the work of creation was a sport and pastime of a happy holiday. The expression is meant to denote the ease with which the operations were performed, and the pleasure which their execution yielded. David uses the same word, speaking of his dancing before the ark, when he says. \"Therefore will I play before the Lord\" (2 Samuel 6:21; comp. Proverbs 10:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth. Wisdom declares wherein she chiefly delighted, viz. in the world as the habitation of rational creatures. \"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good\" (Genesis 1:31); comp. Psalm 104:31, and see the eloquent account of Wisdom in the book so named (7:22-8:1). My delights were with the sons of men. Man, made in the image of God. is the principal object of creative Wisdom's pleasure; and her joy is fulfilled only in the Incarnation. When the Word became flesh, then was the end and design of creation exhibited, and the infinite love of God towards man made, as it were, visible and palpable. Septuagint, \"Because he rejoiced when he completed the world (τὴν οἰκουμένην), and rejoiced in the children of men.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32-36. - Wisdom renews the exhortation before given (Proverbs 5:7; Proverbs 7:20, but now on higher, and not merely moral or social grounds. She deduces, from her Divine origin and her care for man, the lesson that she is to be sought and prized and obeyed above all things. Verse 32. - Now therefore - having regard. to what I have revealed of myself - hearken unto me, O ye children; Septuagint, \"Hear me, my son.\" Blessed are they that keep my ways. The expression is interjectional: \"Blessings on the man! salvation to the man!\" as in Proverbs 3:13. For the ways of Wisdom, see. ch. 3:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Be wise. This will be the effect of attending to the injunction, Hear instruction (see on Proverbs 3:4). The Vatican text of the Septuagint omits this verse; it is added in the Alexandrian and Sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Watching daily at my gates. The idea suggested has been variously taken; e.g. as that of eager students waiting at the school door for their teacher's appearance; clients besieging a great man's portals; Levites guarding the doors of the temple; a lover at his mistress's gate. This last notion is supported by Wisd. 8:2, \"I loved her, and sought her out from my youth; I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.\" Waiting at the posts of my doors; keeping close to the entrance, so as to be quite sure of not missing her whom he longs to see.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - For whoso findeth me findeth life. Here is the reason why the man is blessed who attends to the instruction of Wisdom. A similar promise is made at Proverbs 3:16, 18, 22. The truth here enunciated is also spoken or the Word of God, the everlasting Son of the Father. John 1:4, \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men;\" John 3:36, \"He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life;\" John 17:3, \"This is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ\" (comp. John 8:51; 1 John 5:12; Ecclus. 4:12). Shall obtain favour of the Lord; Vulgate, hauriet salutem, which happily renders the Hebrew verb (Proverbs 12:2). The grace of God bringeth salvation (Titus 2:11). Septuagint, \"For my outgoings (ἔξοδοι) are the outgoings of life, and the will is prepared by the Lord (καὶ ἐτοιμάζεται θέλησις παρὰ Κυρίου).\" This latter clause was used by the Fathers, especially in the Pelagian controversy, to prove the necessity of prevenient grace (see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' 2:32; 'De Gratia,' 6:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs8:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - He that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. So Septuagint and Vulgate. And the truth stated is obvious - he who refuses to obey Wisdom, and transgresses her wholesome rules, will smart for it. Every sin involves punishment, injures the spiritual life, and demands satisfaction. But Delitzsch and others take חֹטְאִי, \"my sinning one,\" \"my sinner,\" in the older sense of \"missing,\" as Job 5:24, the derived meaning of \"sinning\" springing naturally from the idea of deviating from the right way or failing to hit the mark. So here the translation will be \"he who misseth me,\" which is a good contrast to \"whoso findeth me,\" of ver. 35. He who takes a path which does not lead to wisdom is guilty of moral suicide. All that hate me love death (Proverbs 7:27). \"He that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him\" (John 3:36). They who will not hearken to Wisdom, and who scorn her counsels, do virtually love death, because they love the things and the practices which lead to death, temporal and spiritual Job 12:10, \"They that sin are enemies to their own life\" (comp. Wisd. 1:12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Prov.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-18. - 15. Fifteenth admonitory discourse, containing in a parabolic form an invitation of Wisdom (vers. 1-12), and that of her rival Folly (vers. 13-18). The chapter sums up in brief the warnings of the preceding part. Verse 1. - Wisdom was represented as having a house at whose portals persons waited eagerly for admission (Proverbs 8:34); the idea is further carried on. Wisdom hath builded her house. (For the plural form of khochmoth, \"wisdom,\" a plural of excellency, see on Proverbs 1:20.) As the \"strange woman\" in ch. 7. possessed a house to which she seduced her victim, so Wisdom is represented as having a house which she has made and adorned, and to which she invites her pupils. Spiritual writers see here two references - one to Christ's incarnation, when he built for himself a human body (John 2:19); and another to his work in forming the Church, which is his mystical body (1 Peter 2:5). And the sublime language used in this section is not satisfied with the bare notion that we have here only an allegorical representation of Wisdom calling followers to her. Rather we are constrained to see a Divine intimation of the office and work of Christ, not only the Creator of the world, as in ch. 8, but its Regenerator. She hath hewn out her seven pillars. Architecturally, according to Hitzig and others, the pillars of the inner court are meant, which supported the gallery of the first story. Four of these were m the corners, three in the middle of three sides, while the entrance to the court was through the fourth side of the square. The number seven generally denotes perfection; it is the covenant number, expressive of harmony and unity generally, the signature of holiness and blessing, completeness and rest. So in the Apocalypse the whole Church is represented by the number of seven Churches (Revelation 1:4, etc.; see on Proverbs 26:16). Wisdom's house is said to be thus founded because of its perfection and adaptability to all states of men. But doubtless there is a reference to the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit, which rested upon the Christ (Isaiah 11:2, etc.), and which are the support and strength of the Church, being symbolized by the seven-branched candlestick in the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - She hath killed her beasts. So in the parable of the marriage of the king's son (Matthew 22, which is parallel to the present), the king sends his servants to notify the guests that the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Wisdom has stores of nourishment for understanding and affection; and Christ has offered himself as a Victim in our behalf, and now makes bounteous offers of grace, and especially has ordained the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for the strengthening and refreshing of the soul. She hath mingled her wine; Septuagint, \"She hath mixed (ἐκέρασεν) her wine in a bowl.\" The wine which, untempered, was too luscious or too fiery to drink, was made palatable by a certain admixture of water, it was always so mixed at the Passover; and the ancient Christian Liturgies direct the mixture in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, doubtless from traditional use. Some, however, think that allusion is here made to the custom of adding drugs to wine in order to increase its potency. Among the Greeks, ἄκρατος οϊνος meant \"wine without water,\" and in Revelation 14:10 we have ἄκρατον κεκερασμένον, \"undiluted wine mixed.\" And probably in the text the notion is that the fluid for the guests' delectation is properly prepared, that there may be no trouble when they arrive (see on Proverbs 23:30). She hath also furnished her table, by arranging the dishes, etc., thereon (Psalm 23:5, \"Thou preparest a table before me,\" where the same verb, arak, is used; comp. Isaiah 21:5). Moralizing on this passage, St. Gregory says, \"The Lord 'killed the sacrifices' by offering himself on our behalf. He 'mingled the wine,' blending together the cup of his precepts from the historical narration and the spiritual signification. And he 'set forth his table,' i.e. Holy Writ, which with the bread of the Word refreshes us when we are wearied and come to him away from the burdens of the world, and by its effect of refreshing strengthens us against our adversaries\" ('Moral,' 17:43, Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - She hath sent forth her maidens, as in Matthew 22:3, to call them that were bidden to the feast. The Septuagint has τοὺς ἑαυτῆς δούλους, \"her servants,\" but the Authorized Version is correct, and feminine attendants are in strict harmony with the rest of the apologue. By them are represented the apostles and preachers and ministers, who go forth to win souls for Christ. St. Gregory sees in their being called \"maidens\" an intimation that they are in themselves weak and abject, and are only useful and honoured as being the mouthpiece of their Lord ('Moral.,' 33:33). She crieth upon the highest places of the city, where her voice could best be heard, as in Proverbs 8:2; Matthew 10:27. She is not satisfied with delegating her message to others; she delivers it herself. Septuagint, \"calling with a loud proclamation to the cup (ἐπὶ κρατῆρα);\" Vulgate, Misit ancillas suas ut vocarent ad arcem et ad moenia civitatis, \"She has sent her handmaids to invite to the citadel, and to the wails of the town.\" On which rendering St. Gregory comments, \"In that while they tell of the interior life, they lift us up to the high walls of the city above, which same walls, surely, except any be humble, they do not ascend\" ('Moral.,' 17:43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-12. - Here follows the invitation of Wisdom, urging the attendance of guests at the sumptuous banquet which she has prepared (comp. Revelation 19:9). Verse 4. - Whose is simple, lot him turn in hither. This is a direct address to the imprudent and inexperienced (see on Proverbs 7:7), calling them to turn aside from the way on which they are going, and to come to her. Vulgate, si quis est parvulus veniat ad me, which reminds one of Christ's tender words, \"It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish\" (Matthew 18:14). As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him what follows (so ver. 16). Wisdom's own speech is interrupted, and the writer himself introduces this little clause. She calls on the simple and the unwise, both as necessarily needing her teaching, and not yet inveterate in evil, nor wilfully opposed to better guidance. \"The world by wisdom knew not God\" and he \"hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen\" (1 Corinthians 1:21, 26, etc.; comp. Matthew 11:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Come, eat ye of my bread. Wisdom now directly addresses the simple and the foolish (comp. Revelation 22:17). And drink of the wine which I have mingled (see on ver. 2). Bread and wine represent all needful nourishment, as flesh and wine in ver. 2. So Christ says (John 6:51), \"I am the living Bread which came down from heaven... and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" Compare the invitation in Isaiah 55:1, \"He, every one that thirsteth!\" etc. The Fathers see here a prophecy of the gospel feast, wherein Christ gave and gives bread and wine as symbols of his presence (Matthew 26:26, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Forsake the foolish, and live; Vulgate, relinquite infantiam; Septuagint, ἀπολείπετε ἀφροσύνην, \"leave folly.\" These versions take the plural פְתָאִים (petaim) as equivalent to an abstract noun, which gives a good sense; but the plural is not so used in our book, so we must admit the rendering of the Authorized Version, \"Quit the class, give up being of the category of fools,\" or else we must take the word as vocative, \"Leave off, ye simple ones\" (Revised Version), i.e. quit your simplicity, your folly. And live (see on Proverbs 4:4). It is not a mere prosperous life on earth that is here promised, but something far higher and better (John 6:51, \"If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever\"). The LXX. saw something of this when they paraphrased the clause, \"Leave ye folly, that ye may reign forever.\" Go in the way of understanding. Leaving folly, stay not, but make real progress in the direction of wisdom. Septuagint, \"Seek ye prudence, and direct understanding by knowledge.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - These verses form a parenthesis, showing why Wisdom addresses only the simple and foolish. She giveth not that which is holy unto dogs, nor casteth pearls before swine (Matthew 7:6). Verse 7. - He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame. He who tries to correct a scorner (see on Proverbs 1:22 and Proverbs 3:34), one who derides religion, loses his pains and meets with ribald mockery and insult. It is not the fault of messengers or message that this should be, but the hardness of heart and the pride of the hearer make him despise the teaching and hate the teacher (Matthew 24:9). He that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot; rather, he that reproveth a sinner, it is his blot. Such a proceeding results in disgrace to himself. This is not said to discourage the virtuous from reproving transgressors, but states the effect which experience proves to occur in such cases. Prudence, caution, and tact are needed in dealing with these characters. Evil men regard the reprover as a personal enemy, and treat him with contumely, and hence arise unseemly bickerings and disputes, injurious words and deeds. To have wasted teaching on such unreceptive and antagonistic natures is a shameful expenditure of power. St. Gregory thus explains this matter: \"It generally happens that when they cannot defend the evils that are reproved in them, they are rendered worse from a feeling of shame, and carry themselves so high in their defence of themselves, that they take out bad points to urge against the life of the reprover, and so they do not account themselves guilty, if they fasten guilty deeds upon the heads of others also. And when they are unable to find true ones, they feign them, that they may also themselves have things they may seem to rebuke with no inferior degree of justice\" ('Moral.,' 10:3, Oxford transl.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee (see the last note, and comp. Proverbs 15:12, and note there). There are times when reproof only hardens and exasperates. \"It is not proper,\" says St. Gregory, \"for the good man to fear lest the scorner should utter abuse at him when he is chidden, but lest, being drawn into hatred, he should be made worse\" ('Moral.,' 8:67). \"Bad men sometimes we spare, and not ourselves, if from the love of those we cease from the rebuking of them. Whence it is needful that we sometimes endure keeping to ourselves what they are, in order that they may learn in us by our good living what they are not\" (ibid., 20:47, Oxford transl.). Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. So Psalm 141:5, \"Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it\" (comp. Proverbs 19:25; Proverbs 25:12; Proverbs 27:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser. The Hebrew is merely \"give to the wise,\" with no object mentioned; but the context suggests \"instruction,\" even though, as in ver. 8, it takes the form of rebuke. Vulgate and Septuagint, \"Give an opportunity to a wise man, and he will be wiser\" (comp. Matthew 13:12; Matthew 25:29). To make the best use of all occasions of learning duty, whether they present themselves in a winning or a forbidden shape, is the part of one who is wise unto salvation (see Proverbs 1:5, and note there). Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. Wisdom being a moral and not merely an intellectual, quality. there is a natural interchange of \"wise\" and \"just,\" referring to the same individual, in the two clauses. Vulgate, festinabit accipere; Septuagint, \"Instruct a wise man, and he shall have more given him.\" The wise are thus rewarded with larger measures of wisdom, because they are simple, humble, and willing to learn, having that childlike spirit which Christ commends (Matthew 18:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Wisdom returns to the first apothegm and principle of the whole book (Proverbs 1:7). Without the fear of God no teaching is of any avail. The knowledge of the holy is understanding. The word translated \"the holy\" is קְדשִׁים, a plural of excellence (see on Proverbs 30:3) like Elohim, and equivalent to \"the Most Holy One,\" Jehovah, to which it answers in the first hemistich. God is called \"Holy, holy, holy\" (Isaiah 6:3), in his threefold nature, and as majestic beyond expression. The only knowledge worth having, and which is of avail for the practical purposes of life, is the knowledge of God (see on Proverbs 2:5). Septuagint, \"The counsel of the holy (ἁγίων) is understanding,\" with the explanatory clause; \"for to know the Law is the character of good thought.\" This occurs again at Proverbs 13:15, though in the Hebrew in neither place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The parenthetical explanation being concluded, in which Wisdom has intimated why it is useless to appeal to the scorner and the wilful sinner, she now resumes the direct address interrupted at ver. 7, presenting a forcible reason for the advice given in ver. 6, though there is still some connection with ver. 10, as it is from the wisdom that comes from the fear of the Lord that the blessings now mentioned spring. For by me thy days shall be multiplied (see Proverbs 3:2, 16; Proverbs 4:10, where long life is promised as a reward for the possession and practice of wisdom). The same result is attributed to the fear of God (Proverbs 10:27; Proverbs 14:27, etc.). In ver. 6 the address is in the plural; here it is singular. A similar interchange is found in Proverbs 5:7, 8 (where see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself. A transition verse. Wisdom will bring thee good; as thou hast laboured well, so will be thy reward (1 Corinthians 3:8). The LXX. (Syriac and Arabic), with the idea of perfecting the antithesis, adds, καὶ τοῖς πλησίον, \"My son, if thou art wise for thyself, thou shalt be wise also for thy neighbours\" - which contains the great truth that good gifts should not be selfishly enjoyed, but used and dispensed for the advantage of others (Galatians 6:6). In support of our text we may quote Job 22:2, \"Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.\" But if thou scornest, thou alone shalt hear it; i.e. atone for it, bear the sin, as it is expressed in Numbers 9:13, \"Forevery man shall bear his own burden\" (Galatians 6:5). Thus Wisdom ends her exhortation. Septuagint, \"If thou turn out evil, thou alone shalt bear (ἀντλήσεις) evils.\" And then is added the following paragraph, which may possibly be derived from a Hebrew original, but seems more like a congeries made up from other passages, and foisted by some means into the Greek text: \"He that stayeth himself on lies shepherdeth winds, and himself pursueth flying birds; for he hath left the ways of his own vineyard, and hath gone astray with the wheels of his own husbandry; and he goeth through a waterless desert, and over a land set in thirsty places, and with his hands he gathereth unfruitfulness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-18. - This section contains the invitation of Folly, the rival of Wisdom, represented under the guise of an adulteress (Proverbs 2:16; Proverbs 5:3, etc.; Proverbs 6:24, etc.; Proverbs 7.). Verse 13. - I foolish woman; literally, the woman of folly, the genitive being that of apposition, so that this may well be rendered, in order to make the contrast with Wisdom more marked, \"the woman Folly.\" She is regarded as a real person; and between her and Virtue man has to make his choice. Is clamorous; turbulent and animated by passion (as Proverbs 7:11), quite different from her calm, dignified rival. She is simple; Hebrew, \"simplicity,\" in a bad sense; she has no preservative against evil, no moral fibre to resist temptation. And knoweth nothing which she ought to know. Ignorance is the natural accompaniment of Folly: in this case it is wilful and persistent; she goes on her way reckless of consequences. Septuagint, \"A woman foolish and bold, who knows not shame, comes to want a morsel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - She sitteth at the door of her house. She, like Wisdom, has a house of her own, and imitates her in inviting guests to enter. She does not send forth her maidens; she does not stand in the streets and proclaim her mission. Vice has an easier task; all she has to do is to sit and beckon and use a few seductive words. Her house is not supported by seven pillars, built on the grace of God and upheld by the gifts of the Holy Spirit. like that of Wisdom (ver. 1); it is an ordinary habitation of no stately proportions. but its meanness impedes not the uses to which she puts it, her own charms causing her victims to disregard her environments. On a seat in the high pluses of the city. Her house is in the highest and most conspicuous part of the city, and she sits before her door in reckless immodesty, plying her shameful trade (comp. Genesis 38:14; Jeremiah 3:2). The mimicry of her rival again appears, for Wisdom \"crieth upon the highest places of the city\" (ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo call passengers who go right on their ways:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - To call passengers who go right on their ways. With shameless effrontery she cries to all that pass by, she addresses her solicitations to persons who are going straight on their way, thinking nothing of her, having no idea of deviating from their pursued object. As they walk in the path of right and duty, she tries to turn them aside. Septuagint, \"Calling to herself (προσκαλουμένη) those that pass by and are keeping straight in their ways.\" The Fathers find here a picture of the seductions of heretical teaching, which puts on the mask of orthodoxy and deceives the unwary. Wordsworth notes that, in the Apocalypse, the false teacher bears some emblems of the Lamb (Revelation 13:11). All false doctrine retains some element of truth, and it is because of this admixture that it procures adherents and thrives for a time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - These verses contain the invitation which Vice, in imitation of Virtue, and assuming her voice and manner, offers to the wayfarers. Verse 16. - Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. She uses the very same words which Wisdom utters (ver. 4). The latter had addressed the simple because they were inexperienced and undecided, and might be guided aright; the former now speaks to them because they have not vet made their final choice, can still be swayed by lower considerations, and may be led astray. Such persons find it hard to distinguish between the good and the evil, the false and the true, especially when their sensual appetite is aroused and sides with the temptress. No marvel is it that such are easily deceived; for we are told that, under certain circumstances, Satan transforms himself into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). That wanteth understanding. This is the other class addressed by Wisdom, and which Folly now solicits, urging them to follow her on the path of pleasure, promising sensual enjoyment and security.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - This is what she says: Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. The metaphor of \"stolen waters\" refers primarily to adulterous intercourse, as to \"drink waters out of one's own cistern\" (Proverbs 5:15, where see note) signifies the chaste connection of lawful wedlock. Wisdom offered flesh and wine to her guests; Folly offers bread and water. Wisdom invites openly to a well furnished table; Folly calls to a secret meal of barest victuals. What the former offers is rich and satisfying and comforting; what Vice gives is poor and mean and insipid. Yet this latter has the charm of being forbidden; it is attractive because it is unlawful. This is a trait of corrupt human nature, which is recognized universally. Thus Ovid, 'Amor.,' 3:4, 17 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata;NEWLINESic interdictis imminet aeger aquis.' Things easily attained, the possession of which is gotten without effort or danger or breach of restraint, soon pall and cease to charm. To some minds the astuteness and secrecy required for success have an irresistible attraction. Thus St. Augustine relates ('Conf.,' 2:4) how he and some companions committed a theft, not from want and poverty, nor even from the wish to enjoy what was stolen, but simply for the pleasure of thieving and the sin. They robbed a pear tree by night, carried off great loads, which they flung to the pigs, and their only satisfaction was that they were doing what they ought not (\"dum tamen fieret a nobis, quod eo liberet quo non liceret\"). Septuagint, \"Taste ye to your pleasure secret bread, and sweet water of theft.\" Where water is a precious commodity, as in many pets of Palestine, doubtless thefts were often committed, and persons made free with their neighbor's tank when they could do so undetected, thus sparing their own resources and felicitating themselves on their cleverness. On the metaphorical use of \"waters\" in Holy Scripture, St. Gregory says, \"Waters are sometimes wont to denote the Holy Spirit, sometimes sacred knowledge, sometimes calamity, sometimes drifting peoples, sometimes the minds of those following the faith.\" He refers to these texts respectively: John 7:38, etc.; Ecclus. 15:3; Psalm 69:1; Revelation 17:15 (\"the waters are peoples\"); Isaiah 22:20; and he adds, \"By water likewise bad knowledge is wont to be designated, as when the woman in Solomon, who bears the type of heresy, charms with crafty persuasion, saying, 'Stolen waters are sweet'\" ('Moral.,' 19:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTProverbs9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The deluded youth is supposed to be persuaded by the seductions of Folly and to enter her house. The writer, then, in a few weighty words, shows the terrible result of this evil compliance. But he knoweth not that the dead are there (see on Proverbs 2:18 and Proverbs 7:27). There are none \"there,\" in her house, who can be said to be living, they are rephaim, shadowy ghosts of living men, or else demons of the nether world. The Septuagint and Vulgate, with a reference to Genesis 6:4, translate γηγενεῖς and gigantes. Her guests are in the depths of hell (sheol); Septuagint, \"He knows not that giants perish at her side, and he meets with a trap of hell.\" The terrible warning may profitably be repeated more than once, It is like Christ's awful saying, three times enunciated, \"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched\" (Mark 9:44, 46, 48). The LXX. has another paragraph at the end of this verse, which has no counterpart in the Hebrew: \"But start away, delay not in the place, nor put thy name ['eye,' al.] by her; for thus shalt thou pass over (διαβήσῃ) strange water; but abstain thou from strange water, and of a strange spring drink not, that thou mayest live long, and years of life may be added to thee.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
