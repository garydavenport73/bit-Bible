"Job.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-22. - Having answered Bildad, Job proceeds to pour out the bitterness of his soul in a pathetic complaint, which he addresses directly to God. There is not much that is novel in the long expostulation, which mainly goes over ground covered in ch. 3, 6, and 7; but some new grounds are alleged as pleas for mercy, if not for justice. These areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that he is God's gesture, and in the past (at any rate) has been the object of his care (vers. 8, 8-12);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that God must be above judging as man judges (vers. 4, 5);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that God knows his innocence (ver. 7); andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) that he (Job) is entirely in God's power (ver. 7). In conclusion, Job begs for a little respite, a little time of comfort (ver. 20), before he descends into the darkness of the grave (vers. 21, 22). Verse 1. - My soul is weary of my life. This is better than the marginal rendering, and well expresses the original. It strikes the key-note of the chapter. I will leave my complaint upon myself; rather, I will give free course to my complaint over myself, or I will allow myself in the expression of it (see the Revised Version). Job implies that hitherto he has put some restraint upon himself, but now he will give full and free expression to his feelings. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul (comp. Job 7:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; literally, do not pronounce me wicked My friends, as they call themselves, have, one and all, condemned me: do not thou also condemn me. A touching appeal! Show me wherefore thou contendest with me. One of Job's principal trials is the perplexity into which his unexampled sufferings have thrown him. He cannot understand why he has been singled out for such tremendous punishment, when he is not conscious to himself of any impiety or other heinous sin against God. So now, when he has resolved to vent all the bitterness of his soul, he ventures to ask the question - Why is he so tried? What has he done to make God his enemy? Wherefore does God fight against him continually?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress? Job assumes that he is oppressed. He has no conception that his sufferings are a purification (John 15:2), intended to lead to the elevation and improvement of his moral character. He therefore asks - Is it worthy of God, is it good in him, is it compatible with his perfect excellence, to be an oppressor? It is a sort of argumentum ad verecundiam well enough between man and man, but quite out of place between a man and his Maker. That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands (comp. Psalm 138:8). This argument is more legitimate. God may be expected, not to despise, but to care for, the work of his own hands (comp. Isaiah 19:25; Isaiah 29:23; 64:21; Isaiah 64:8; Ephesians 2:10). Every maker of a thing, as Aristotle says, loves his work, and naturally guards it, cares for it, and cherishes it. And shine upon the counsel of the wicked (comp. Job 9:24). The prosperity of evil-doers must arise, Job thinks, from God allowing his countenance to shine upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? Notwithstanding the anthropomorphism of their language, the sacred writers are as fully aware as their modern critics of the immateriality of God, and the immense gap that separates his nature from human nature. It is on this that Job now dwells. God, being so much above man, having eyes that are not of flesh, and seeing not as man sooth, ought not to judge as man judges, with partiality, or prejudice, or even with extreme severity (ver. 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Are thy days as man's days? In short-lived man, shortsightedness and prejudice are excusable, but not in one whose days are unlike man's days - whose \"years endure throughout all generations\" (Is. 102:24). Such a one ought to be above all human infirmity. Or thy years as man's days? We should have expected \"as man's years.\" But it marks the disparity more strongly to say, \"Are thy years not greater in number even than man's [literally, 'a strong man's'] days?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin. It seems to Job that God must have been \"extreme to mark what he has done amiss\" (Psalm 130:3), must have searched into every corner of Ms life, and hunted out all his sins and shortcomings, to have been able to bring together against him a total commensurate or even approximately commensurate, with the punishment wherewith he has visited him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou knowest that I am not wicked; rather, although thou knowest (see the Revised Version). Conscious of his own integrity and faithfulness, Job feels that God too must know them; wherefore it seems to him all the harder that he should be made to suffer as if he were a \"chief sinner.\" And there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.NEWLINENEWLINE\"'Tis excellent to have a giant's strength;NEWLINEBut tyrannous to use it like a giant.\" Job's last ground of appeal is, that he is wholly at God s mercy, can look for no other deliverer, no other support or stay. Will not God, then, have pity, and \"spare him a little, that he may recover his strength before he goes hence, and is no more seen \"? (see Psalm 39:15; and comp. below, ver. 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-12. - Here we have an expansion of the plea in ver. 3, \"Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest despise the work of thine own hands?\" Job appeals to God, not only as his Greater, but as, up to a certain time, his Supporter and Sustainer. Verse 8. - Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about (comp. Psalm 139:12-16, \"My reins are thine; thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well My bones are not hid from thee, though I be made secretly, and fashioned beneath in the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in thy book were all my members written, which day by day were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them\"). Canon Cook observes with much truth, \"The processes of nature are always attributed in Scripture to the immediate action of God. The formation of every individual stands, in the language of the Holy Ghost, precisely on the same footing as that of the first man\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 50). Yet thou dost destroy me; literally, devour me (comp. Job 9:17, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; rather, that thou hast fashioned me as day; i.e. \"Thou hast formed me, as a potter fashions a pot out of clay.\" This is scarcely a reference to Genesis 3:19, but rather an early use of what became a stock metaphor (comp. Isaiah 29:16; Isaiah 30:14:; 45:9; 64:8; Jeremiah 18:6; Romans 9:21-2.9, etc.). And wilt thou bring us into dust again? After having fashioned me out of clay into a human form, wilt thou undo thine own work, crumble me into powder, and make me mere dust once more?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? \"Didst not thou\" i.e., \"form me as an embryo in the womb, gradually solidifying my substance, and changing soft juices into a firm though tender mass?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh. \"To thee,\" that is, \"I owe the delicate skin, which encloses my frame, and keeps it compact; to thee I owe the flesh whereof my frame chiefly consists.\" And hast fenced ms with bones and sinews; rather, and hast woven me or knit me together (see the Revised Version, and comp. Psalm 139:13, where the same verb is used in the same sense). The idea is that the body altogether is woven and compacted of skin, bone, flesh, sinews, etc., into a delicate and elaborate garment (comp. 2 Corinthians 5:2-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou hast granted me life and favour. God, besides providing Job with a body so delicately and marvellously constructed, had added the gift of \"life\" (Genesis 2:7), and also that of \"favour,\" or loving providential care, whereby his life was preserved from infancy to manhood, and from manhood to a ripe age, in peace and prosperity. Job has not forgotten his former state of temporal happiness (Job 1:2-5), nor ceased to feel gratitude to God for it (comp. Job 2:10). And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit; or, thy providence - \"thy continual care.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And these things hast thou hid in thine heart; rather, get these things didst thou hide in thine heart; i.e. \"Yet all the while, notwithstanding thy protecting care and gracious favour, thou wert hiding in thy heart the intention to bring all these evils upon me; thou couldst not but have known what thou wert about to do, though thou didst conceal thy intention, and allow no sign of it to escape thee.\" I know that this is with thee; rather, I know that this was with thee; i.e. this intention to destroy my happiness was \"with thee\" - present to thy thought - even while thou wert loading me with favour. Job's statement cannot be gainsaid; but it involves no real charge against God, who assigns men prosperity or suffering as is best for them at the time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If I sin, then thou markest me; rather, if I sinned then thou didst observe me. Thou tookest note of all my sins as I committed them, and laidest them up in thy memory. And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. This record of my offences thou still hast against me, and I cannot expect that thou wilt acquit me of them. Without some one to atone for them, men cannot be acquitted of their offences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - If I be wicked, woe unto me! If, on the whole, this record of my sins be such that I am pronounced guilty before God, then I accept my doom. Woe unto me! I must submit to suffer. And if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. If, on the contrary, it be admitted that I have not sinned so grievously as to be pronounced unrighteous, even then I will not beast; I will not exalt myself; I will not hold up my head as if I were sinless. I am full of confusion. This clause should not be separated from the last. The sense runs on: \"I will not lift up my head (being, as I am), full of confusion,\" or \"of shame,\" through consciousness of my own imperfections (see the Revised Version). Therefore see thou mine affliction; rather, and seeing my afflictions. The sense given in the Authorized Version is maintained by Rosenmuller, De Wette, Stanley Leathes, and Merx, and defended by Canon Cook; but opposed by Schultens, Professor Lee, and our Revisers. If we accept the views of these last, the whole passage will run thus: \"If I be [pronounced] wicked, woe unto reel but if righteous, yet will I not lift up my head, being [as I am] full of confusion, and seeing my afflictions.\" Job still views his afflictions as signs of God's disfavour, and therefore proofs of his sinfulness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For it increaseth. Thou huntest me. This passage is very obscure, and has been taken in several quite different senses. On the whole, it is not clear that any better meaning can be assigned to it than that of the Authorized Version, \"For my affliction increaseth,\" or \"is ever increasing. Thou huntest me;\" i.e. thou art continually pursuing me with thy plagues, thy \"arrows\" (Job 6:4), thy\" wounds\" (Job 9:17), thy poisoned shafts (Job 6:4). Thou givest me no rest, therefore I am ever conscious of my afflictions. As a fierce lion. Schultens regards Job as the lion, and so Jarchi and others. But most commentators take the view that the lion is God (comp. Isaiah 31:4; Isaiah 38:13; Jeremiah 25:38; Lamentations 3:10; Hosea 5:14; Hosea 13:7, 8). And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me; or, thou dealest marvellously with me; i.e. \"in-flictest on me strange and marvellous sufferings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou renewest thy witnesses against me. Each fresh calamity that Job suffers is a new witness that God is displeased with him, both in his own eyes, and in those of his \"comforters.\" Hie disease was no doubt continually progressing, and going from bad to worse, so that every day a new calamity seemed to befall him. And increasest thine indignation upon me; i.e. \"makest it more and more evidently to appear, that thou art angry with me.\" Changes and war are against me; rather, changes and a host; i.e. attacks that are continually changing - a whole host of them, or \"host after host\" (Revised Version margin), come against me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? A recurrence to his original complaint (Job 3:3-10); as if, after full consideration, he returned to the conviction that the root of the whole matter - the real thing of which he might justly complain - was that he had ever been born into the world alive! Oh that I had given up the ghost! Before birth, or in the act of birth (so Job 3:11). And no eye had seen me! \"No eye,\" i.e., \"had looked upon my living face.\" For then -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. So short an existence would have been the next thing to no existence at all, and would have equally satisfied my wishes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little. Job here returns from vague longings and idle aspirations to actual realities - the facts of the case - and asks, \"Is not the time that I now have to live short? Must not my disease make an end of me in a very brief space? If so, then may I not make a request? My petition is that God will 'cease' from me, grant me a respite, 'let me alone' for a short time, remove his heavy hand, and allow me to 'take comfort a little,' recover my strength, and obtain a breathing-space, before my actual end, before the time comes for my descent to Sheol,\" which is then (vers. 21, 22) described. The parallel with Psalm 39:13 is striking.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Before I go whence I shall not return (comp. Job 7:9; and see 2 Samuel 12:23). Even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death. Job's idea of the receptacle of the dead, while it has some analogies with the Egyptian under-world, and even more with the Greek and Roman conceptions of Hades or Orcus, was probably derived from Babylonia, or Chaldea, on which the land that he inhabited bordered (Job 1:17). It was within the earth, consequently dark and sunless (compare the Umbrae of the Romans, and Euripides's νέκρων κευθμῶνα καὶ σκότου πύλας), deep (Job 11:8), dreary, fastened with belts and bars (Job 17:16). The Babylonians spoke of it as \"the abode of darkness and famine, where earth was men's food, and their nourishment clay; where light was not seen, but in darkness they dwelt; where ghosts, like birds, fluttered their wings; and where, on the doors and on the door-posts, the dust lay undisturbed\" (Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. 1. p. 118).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A land of darkness, as darkness itself; or, a land of thick darkness (see the Revised Version). And of the shadow of death, without any order. The absence of order is a new and peculiar feature. We do not find it in the other accounts of Hades. But it lends additional horror and weirdness to the scene. And where the light is as darkness. Not, therefore, absolutely without light, but with such a light as Milton calls \"darkness visible.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-20. - Zophar, the Naamathite, the third of Job's comforters (Job 2:11), and probably the youngest of them, now at last takes the word, and delivers an angry and violent speech. He begins by accusing Job of having spoken at undue length, and at the same time, boastfully and mockingly (vers. 2-4). He then expresses a wish that God would take Job at his word, and really answer him, since he is sure that the result would be to show that Job had been punished much less than he. deserved to be (vers. 5, 6). Job's complaints against the justice of God's dealings he meets by an assertion of God's unsearchableness and perfect wisdom, which he contrasts with the folly of man (ver. 7-12). Finally, he suggests that a stricken man, being guilty, should humble himself, put away his iniquity, and turn to God, in which ease he may expect a restoration to favour. Otherwise, he has only to look for wretchedness, failure, and despair (vers. 18-20). Verse 1. - Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said (see the comment on Job 2:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Should not the multitude of words be answered? A \"multitude of words\" is often reproved in Scripture, and taken as a sign of either folly (Ecclesiastes 5:8) or sin (Proverbs 10:19). Job had certainly been somewhat unduly verbose, and laid himself open to the taunt here launched against him; but neither had brevity been studied by his other friends in their previous answers (ch. 4, 5, and 8.), nor is it greatly studied by Zophar here. And should a man full of talk be justified? literally, a man of lips which may mean either \"a great talker\" or \"a man who makes many professions.\" There is a widespread prejudice against a great orator, and a widespread notion that a good cause does net need many words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Should thy lies make men hold their peace? or, thy boastings (see the Revised Version; and comp. Isaiah 16:5; Jeremiah 48:30). Zophar probably refers to such passages as Job 9:20, 35; Job 10:7, 15, where Job might seem to have justified himself altogether. And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed I It is not quite easy to see what in Job's speeches up to this point could be regarded as \"mocking.\" But perhaps Zophar would have thus characterized the following passages: Job 6:13, 14, 25-27; Job 7:12; Job 9:22-24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure. Job had certainly not said this in so many words. In fact, he had not spoken of his \"doctrine\" (לקח), nor had he called either his doctrine or his conduct absolutely pure (ז). But, no doubt, he had maintained, in a certain sense, his innocency; not, indeed, his entire freedom from sin or guilt, but his honest endeavour to serve God and lead a good life. This was the real point disputed between him and his \"comforters;\" they argued, from his sufferings, that he must be a \"chief sinner;\" he maintained, from the testimony of his conscience, that he was free from all heinous sins. And I am clean in thine eyes (see above, Job 9:30; Job 10:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee! \"Oh that God would do,\" i.e. \"what thou hast challenged him to do\" - show thee wherein he contends with thee! (comp. Job 10:2). Then how would thy reasonings be confuted, and thy boastings be brought low!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! In God are \"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid away\" (ἀπόκρυφοι Colossians 2:3). Zophar wishes that he would reveal to Job this wisdom, or a portion of it, as, in that case, all his pride and self-confidence would be confounded and fall away. That they are double to that which is! This phrase is very obscure. Some translate, \"For he (i.e. God) is twice as wise as thou;\" others, \"That it (i.e. wisdom) is manifold in effectual working;\" others, again, \"That they (i.e. the treasures of wisdom) are double (or manifold) in substance.\" Perhaps this last rendering is to be preferred. The treasures of wisdom that are hid away in God have many depths, secret and unexplored; they \"lie, as it were, fold over fold, in unexpected complexities, defying the shallow and unscrutinizing gaze\" (Professor Stanley Leathes). If they were revealed to Job, they would astonish, confound, silence, him. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. \"Be sure,\" i.e., \"that God, so far from inflicting on thee a more severe punishment than thou deservest, in reality excuses much of thy guilt, and punishes thee less than is thy due.\" This is Zophar's conclusion from his general knowledge of God's dealings with man (comp. Ezra 9:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Canst thou by searching find out God? literally, Canst thou attain to the searching out of God? Canst thou suppose, that is, that, whatever thy wisdom, learning, subtlety, sagacity, power of insight, thou wilt be able to search out and fully know the character, attributes, modes of thought and action, of the Most High? No. In one sense, all men do well to profess them. selves \"Agnostics\" - not that they can know nothing of God, but that they can never know him fully, never exhaust the knowledge of him. As the apostle says, \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God l how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?\" (Romans 11:33, 34). Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? rather. Canst thou attain to the perfection of the Almighty? understand, i.e., his inconceivable perfectness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? literally, heights of the heavens; what canst thou do? But the meaning is probably that expressed in the Authorized Version. God's perfectness is unattainable by man's thought, as the heights of the heavens are by his feet. Deeper than hell; literally, than Sheol, or the receptacle of the dead (see the comment on Job 10:21). St. Paul speaks of the \"deep things,\" or rather, \"the depths\" (τὰ βάθη) of God (see 1 Corinthians 2:10). What canst thou know? How small a part of the Divine nature can any man thoroughly comprehend and know!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. Zophar's metaphors are drawn from the objects which, to his mind, exceed in extent all others. \"The earth\" and \"the sea\" represent to him the illimitable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - If he cut off; rather, if he advance (comp. Job 9:11). And shut up; or, imprison. Or gather together; rather, and call to judgment (see the Revised Version). If God, that is, advance against a man in hostile fashion, seize and imprison him, and then call him to judgment, what is to be said or done? who can interfere with him? Matters must take their course. There is no ground for complaint It is simply God's mode of administering justice on the earth. Who can hinder him? literally, who can turn him sway? i.e. interfere with his action, interrupt it, divert it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For he knoweth vain men. God is justified in these his judgments, even though he does not implead the man or bring him to account, or hear what he has got to say (Job 9:39), since he intuitively and at once \"knoweth vain men;\" sooth, that is, into the ground of the heart, and recognizes vanity, pretence, false seeming, so that he can judge infallibly without the forensic apparatus wherewith human tribunals are rightly surrounded, on account of the weakness and fallibility of human judges. He sooth wickedness also. If God can detect in a moment vanity, pretence, false seeming, much more can he detect actual wickedness; which Zophar assumes to have been detected in Job's case. Will he not then consider it? rather, even though he consider it not (see the Revised Version). God does not need to pause and ponder and \"consider\" each case. He knows, without any such lengthened consideration, whether a man is true to him or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt; rather, and a vain man may get understanding, and the colt of a wild ass become a than (compare the Revised Version, marginal rendering). Zophar seems to mean that, through Divine discipline, such as that described in ver. 10, a vain, foolish, puffed-up man may be reclaimed and become a man of understanding - a stubborn and untamed one, wild as the colt of a wild ass, grow into a real man, i.e. acquire sense and discretion. If this is the meaning, undoubtedly Job is glanced at (so Schultens, Dillmann, and Canon Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If thou prepare thine heart. Having indicated God's righteousness by these general remarks (vers. 7-12), and implied that Job's complaints are vain and futile, Zophar, in conclusion, addresses Job once more directly: \"If thou (אתּה) prepare thine heart,\" cleanse it, that is, of all defilement, direct it, and set it straight (see Psalm 78:8) before God, then such and such results (set forth in vers. 15-19) will follow. And stretch out thine hands toward him. The outward act of worship must follow the inward movement of the heart, for the turning to God to be complete.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If iniquity be in thine hand. Zophar assumes this to be probable, nay, almost certain. He has already told Job that God has exacted from him less than his iniquity (און, the same word) deserves (ver. 6). Conformably with this view, he now suggests that it would not do for Job to stretch out to God in prayer a hand full of iniquity, and that therefore, previously to making his supplication, he would do well to lay his iniquity aside. In a general way, the advice is excellent; but it was insulting to Job, who denied that he had any definite act of sin on his conscience. Put it far away; i.e. repent of it, confess it to God; if the case admits of it, make reparation or restitution. And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles; or, in thy tents. The insinuation seems to be that Job is a robber chief, and that his tent and the tents of his followers are full of ill-gotten spoils, the fruit of his raids upon the defenceless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For then; rather, surely then (see the Revised Version). Shalt thou lift up thy face without spot. At present, Zophar implies, he could not do so. The stain of many sins was on him (vers. 6, 11, 14). Yea, thou shalt be steadfast; literally, molten - perhaps \"pure as refined metal\" (see Isaiah 1:25), perhaps \"bright as a metallic mass.\" And shalt not fear. \"Shalt be freed,\" i.e.,\" from all the fears that disturb thee now\" (see Job 3:26; Job 6:4; Job 7:14; Job 9:28, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Because thou shalt forget thy misery. All thy past misery shall be clean swept away from thy remembrance, because of the happy condition whereto thou shalt be raised (see vers. 18, 19). \"Sorrow's memory\" is not always \"a sorrow still.\" And remember it as waters that pass away; i.e. remember it no more than a man remembers the shower that has passed away or the pool that is dried up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; literally, shall arise above the noonday; i.e. \"exceed it in splendour.\" Instead of the \"thick darkness\" to which Job is looking forward (Job 10:21, 22), he shall bask in a light brighter than that of the sun at noon. Thou shalt shine forth. The Hebrew cannot possibly bear this meaning. The uncommon word used is allied with עֵיפָה, \"obscurity,\" and, if a verb, should mean \"thou shalt be obscure,\" rather than \"thou shalt shine forth.\" But it is perhaps a substantive, meaning \"darkness;\" and the translation of the Revised Version is perhaps correct: \"Though there be darkness.\" Thou shalt be as the morning. \"Thy light,\" as Professor Lee explains, \"shall gradually rise and expand itself far and wide.\" It shall dispel the darkness, and take its place,\" shining more and more unto the perfect day\" (Proverbs 4:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope. Job, entering on this second period of prosperity, would be and feel secure; safe, i.e. from any return of calamity, because hope would once more animate him and be his predominant feeling. No doubt \"hope springs eternal in the human breast;\" and when Job's prosperity was actually restored (Job 42:12-16), these anticipations had their fulfilment; but, as uttered by Zophar, there is a ring of insincerity about them, and we cannot but feel that his object in expatiating at length on the details of Job's coming happiness is not to console and encourage his friend, but rather to annoy and exasperate him, since the entire basis on which he builds is the assumption of Job's heinous guilt (vers. 3, 6, 11, 14), and the prosperity which he promises is to follow upon an acknowledgment of guilt and a putting sway of iniquity (vers. 13, 14), which he knew that Job wholly repudiated. Yea, thou shalt dig about thee. So Schultens, who understands it to mean that Job shall dig a moat around his habitation, to make himself perfectly secure. The verb has, however, two other meanings - \"to investigate\" or \"search out,\" and \"to blush;\" and it is taken here in each of these meanings by some critics. Our Revisers translate, \"Yea, thou shalt search about thee;\" and so Canon Cook and Professor Stanley Loathes. Rosenmuller, on the other hand, and Professor Lee render the words by \"Though thou shouldst blush,\" or \"be ashamed.\" It is difficult to decide between such high authorities; but the fast that Job uses the verb in the sense of \"search,\" \"look after,\" in Job 39:29, and does not elsewhere use it in either of the other senses, should incline us to accept the rendering of the Revised Version. And thou shalt take thy rest in safety; or, securely; i.e. with a sense of being in perfect security.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; i.e. there shall be no more raids on the part of Sabeans (Job 1:15) or Chaldeans (Job 1:17) to affright and injure thee. Yea, many shall make suit unto thee. On the contrary, thy aid shall be invoked, thy interference on their behalf prayed for, by many.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Had Zophar ended with ver. 19 Job might possibly have taken some comfort from his speech, holding out, as it did, a hope of restoration to God's favour and a return to happiness. But, as if to accentuate the unfavourable view which he takes of Job's conduct and character, he will not end with words of good omen, but appends a passage which has a ring of malice, menace, and condemnation. But the eyes of the wicked shall fail; or, waste away grew weary, i.e. of looking for a help that does not come, and a deliverer who does not make his appearance. And they shall not escape; literally, their refuge is perished from them. And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost; rather, shall be the giving up of the ghost. They shall have no other hope but death - a manifest allusion to Job's repeated declarations that he looks for death, longs for it, and has no expectation of any other deliverance (see Job 3:21, 22; Job 6:7, 8; Job 7:15; Job 10:1, 18. etc.). Such, says Zophar, is always the final condition of the wicked.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - And Job answered and said, No doubt but ye are the people.

I do not fall below you in either respect.\" Yea, who knoweth not such things as these? \"Not,\" Job means to say, \"that much understanding is necessary in such a case as this; any man of common intelligence can form a correct judgment on the point in dispute between us.\" The special point, in Job's mind, seems to be God's complete mastery over the world, and absolute control over all that takes place in it (see the introductory paragraph).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I am as one mocked of his neighbour. You have accused me of mockery (Job 11:3): but it is I that have been mocked of you. The allusion is probably to Job 11:2, 3, 11, 12, and 20. Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him. You mock me, though I have always clung to religion, have called upon God in prayer, and from time to time had my prayers answered by him. Thus it is the just upright man that is laughed to scorn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease; rather, as in the Revised Version, In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it (i e. contempt) is ready for them whose foot slippeth. The meaning is, \"I am despised and scorned by you who sit at ease, because my foot has slipped, and I have fallen into misfortune.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The tabernacles of robbers prosper. Having set at rest the personal question between himself and his friends, Job reverts to his main argument, and maintains that, the whole course of mundane events being under God's governance, all the results are to be attributed to him, and among them both the prosperity of the wicked, and, by parity of reasoning, the sufferings of the righteous. And they that provoke God are secure (comp. Job 9:24; Job 10:3). Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. So both the Authorized and the Revised Versions; but recent critics mostly render, \"who bring their God in their hand,\" i.e. \"who regard their own right hand as their God\" (comp. Virgil, 'Aen., 10:773, \"Dextra mihi Dens\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee. Job here begins his review of all creation, to show that God has the absolute direction of it. The order ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) beasts,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) birds,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) fishes, is that of dignity (comp. Genesis 9:2; Psalm 8:7, 8).NEWLINENEWLINEJob maintains that, if appeal were made to the animal creation, and they were asked their position with respect to God, they would with one voice proclaim him their absolute Ruler and Director. And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee. The instincts of birds, their periodical migrations, their inherited habits, are as wonderful as anything in the Divine economy of the universe, and as much imply God's continually directing hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee. If the material earth be intended, the appeal must be to its orderly course, its summers and winters, its seedtime and harvest, its former and latter rains, its constant productivity, which, no less than animal instincts, speak of a single ruling power directing and ordering all things. If the creeping things of the earth, the reptile creation, be meant, then the argument is merely an expansion of that in the preceding verse. The instincts of reptiles are to be ascribed, no less than those of beasts and birds, to the constant superintending action and providence of the Almighty. And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. The testimony will be unanimous - beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes will unite in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Who knoweth not in all these; or, by all these; i.e. by all these instances. That the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? literally, the hand of Jehovah. The name \"Jehovah does not occur elsewhere in the dialogue, though it is employed frequently in the historical sections (Job 1:6-12, 21; Job 2:1-7; Job 38:1; Job 40:1, 3, 6; Job 42:1, 7-12). The writer probably regards the name as unfamiliar, if not unknown, to Job's neighbours, and therefore as avoided by him in his discussions with them. But here, for once, he forgets to be consistent with himself. Outside Scripture, the name is first found on the Moabite Stone (about B.C. 890), where it designates the God worshipped by the Israelites (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 11. p. 166, 1. 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In whose hand is the soul of every living thing. A brief summary of what had been said in vers. 7, 8, to which is now appended the further statement, that in God's hand - wholly dependent on him - is the entire race of mankind also. And the breath of all mankind; literally, and the spirit of all flesh of man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Doth not the ear try words? and the month taste his meat? rather, as the palate tasteth its meat? (see the Revised Version). In other words, \"Is it not as much the business of the ear to discriminate between wise and unwise words, as of the palate to determine between pleasant and unpleasant tastes?\" The bearing of the verse on the general argument is not clear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. Men get their wisdom gradually and painfully by much experience during a long stretch of time, so that it is not until they are\" ancient\" that we can call them wise or credit them with \"understanding.\" But with God the case is wholly different.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - With him is wisdom and strength. With God wisdom and strength dwell essentially. He is not wiser or stronger at one time than at another. Time and experience add nothing to the perfection of his attributes, which are unchangeable. Such wisdom infinitely transcends any to which man can attain, and therefore is doubtless the wisdom whereby the world is governed. He hath counsel and understanding. God has these qualities as his own. They are not acquired or imparted, but belong to him, necessarily and always.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again. Professor Lee thinks that the allusion is to the cities of the plain (Genesis 19:24-29). But the sentiment is so general, that we may well doubt if particular instances were in Job's mind. At any rate, the destructive agencies of nature must be as much included as any supernatural acts. He shutteth up a man (comp. Job 11:10). God \"shuts up\" men when be hedges them in with calamities or other circumstances, which take away from them all freedom of action (Job 3:23; Job 19:8) When he does this, the result follows - There can be no opening. No other power can give release.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up. God, at his pleasure, causes great droughts, which are among the worst calamities that can happen. He withholds the blessed rain from heaven (Deuteronomy 11:17; 1 Kings 8:35; 1 Kings 17:1), and the springs shrink, and the rivers dry up, and a fruitful land is turned into a desert, and famine stalks through the land, and men perish by thousands. Also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth; i.e. he causes floods and inundations. Once upon a time he overwhelmed the whole earth, and destroyed almost the entire race of mankind, by a deluge of an extraordinary character, which so fixed itself in the human consciousness, that traces of it are to be found in the traditions of almost all the various races of men. But, beside this great occasion, he also in ten thousand other cases, causes, by means of floods, tremendous ruin and devastation, sweeping away crops and cattle, and even villages and cities, sometimes even \"overturning the earth,\" causing lakes to burst, rivers to change their course, vast tracts of land to be permanently submerged, and the contour of coasts to be altered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - With him is strength and wisdom; rather (as in the Revised Version), with him is strength and effectual working. God has not only the wisdom to design the course of events (ver. 13), but the power and ability to carry out all that he designs. The deceived and the deceiver are his. Not only does God rule the course of external nature, but also the doings of men. \"Shall there be evil in a city, and shall not he have done it?\" (Amos 3:6) He allows some to deceive, and others to be deceived. Moral evil is thus under his control, and, in a certain sense, may be celled his doing. But it behoves men, when they approach such great mysteries, to be very cautious and wary in their speech. Job touches with somewhat too bold a hand the deepest problems of the universe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He leadeth counsellors away spoiled. The wise of the earth cannot resist or escape him; he frustrates their designs and overthrows them, and, as it were, leads them away captive. And maketh the judges fools; rather, and judges maketh he fools. There is no article, and no particular judges are referred to (comp. Isaiah 44:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. This may either mean that God at his pleasure both looses kings from captivity, and also binds them with a cord and causes them to be carried away captive; or that he looses the authority which kings have over their subjects, and then lets them be carried away captive by their enemies. The latter is perhaps the more probable sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He leadeth princes away spoiled; rather, priests (כהנים), as in the Revised Version. This is the only mention of \"priests\" in the Book of Job, and a priest-caste, such as that of Egypt or of Israel, can scarcely be meant. The priests are placed among the mighty, on a par with kings (ver. 18), princes (ver. 21), and \"the strong\" (ver. 21). This context makes us naturally think of those priest-kings whom we hear of in the olden times, such as were Melchizedek (Genesis 19:18-20) and Jethro (Exodus 3:1; Exodus 18:1-27), and the Egyptian kings of the twenty-first dynasty ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 408-415), and Ethbaal of Tyro ('History of Phoenicia,' p. 435), and Sethos (Herod., 2, 141), and others. Job's allusion is probably to persons of this exalted class, who no doubt were sometimes defeated and dragged into captivity, like other rulers and governors. And overthroweth the mighty. Schultens understands by ethanim (איחנים) \"great teachers;\" but the ordinary meaning of the word is \"strong\" or \"mighty\" (see Job 33:19; Micah 6:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He removeth away the speech of the trusty. God deprives trusted statesmen of their eloquence, destroys their reputation and their authority. And taketh away the understanding of the aged. He turns wise and aged men into fools and drivellers, weakening their judgments and reducing them to imbecility.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He poureth contempt upon princes; literally, upon the munificent. But the word has often the more generic sense of \"princes,\" \"great men\" (see 1 Samuel 2:8; Proverbs 25:7, etc.). And weakeneth the strength of the mighty; literally, looseth the belt of the strong. But our version sufficiently expresses the meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He discovereth deep things out of darkness. By \"deep things\" are probably meant the \"deeply laid schemes\" which wicked men concoct in darkness (or secrecy). These God often \"discovers,\" or causes to be laid bare. English history can point to such a case in the discovery of the famous \"Gunpowder Plot\" in the second year of King James I. And bringeth out to light the shadow of death. There is nothing secret which God cannot, if he choose, reveal; nor is there anything hid which he cannot make known. Dark, murderous schemes, on which lies a shadow as of death, which men plan in secret, and keep hidden in their inmost thoughts, he can, and often does, cause to be brought to light and made manifest in the sight of all. Every such scheme, however carefully guarded and concealed, shall be one day made known (Matthew 10:26). Many are laid bare even in the lifetime of their devisers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them. God's providence concerns itself, not only with the fate of individual men, bet also with that of nations. With Israel, his \"peculiar people\" (Deuteronomy 14:2), he especially concerned himself, but not with Israel only. Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, Elam, Edom, Ammon, Moab, were likewise objects of his attention, of his guidance, of his chastening hand, of his avenging rod. Particular nations were consigned by God to the charge of particular angels (Daniel 10:13, 20). At his pleasure he can \"increase\" nations by blessing them with extraordinary fecundity (Exodus 1:7-12), or \"destroy\" them by internal decay, by civil wars, or by the swords of their neighbours. He enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again; i.e. \"enlarges their bounds, or diminishes them.\" In Western Asia, where Job lived, empires were continually starting up, growing and expanding, increasing to vast dimensions, and then after a while shrinking back again to their original narrow limits Egypt, Elam, Babylon, and the Hittite nation were eases in point.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth; rather. the chiefs of the people or \"the popular chief talus\" (Lee). He deprives these \"chiefs\" of their wisdom or courage, or both, and thus brings down the nations under their governance. And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way; rather, in a chaos - one of the words used in Genesis 1:2 to describe the condition of the material universe before God had ordered and arranged it. The chieftains, deprived of their \"heart,\" are so confused and perplexed that they do not know what to do, or which way to turn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They grope in the dark without light (comp.

And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man; literally, to wander - to pursue a devious course instead of a straight one.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - The first two verses of ch. 13. are closely connected with ch. 12, forming the natural termination to the first section of Job's argument, that all results, whether good or evil, must be referred to God. Ver. 1 is little more than a repetition of Job 12:9 and ver. 2 of Job 12:3. Verse 1. - Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. All the particulars mentioned concerning God's government of the world in Job 12:6-25 are derived by Job from his own experience. His eye has seen them or his ear has heard them. He is not indebted to others for information on these simple points, which he regards as necessarily impressed by their experience on all grown men (see Job 12:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - What ye know, the same do I know also. Job's friends have claimed to instruct him and set him right, on the ground of their age and experience (Job 4:8; Job 5:27; Job 8:8-10), He protests that, in the matters on which they have lectured him, they have no advantage over himself - he knows all that they know - in truth, the knowledge is open to all (see Job 12:3). I am not inferior unto you. An exact repetition of the second clause of Job 12:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-13. - The second section of Job's argument is prefaced, like the first (Job 12:2-5), with a complaint with respect to the conduct of his opponents. He taxes them with the fabrication of lies (ver 4), with want of skill as physicians of souls (ver. 4), with vindicating God by reasonings in which they do not themselves believe (vers. 7, 8), and consequently with really mocking him (ver. 9). Having warned them that they are more likely to offend God than to please him by such arguments as those that they have urged (vers. 10-12), he calls on them to hold their peace, and allow him to plead his cause with God (ver. 13). Verse 3. - Surely I would speak to the Almighty. It is not Job's wish to argue his ease with his three friends, but to reason it out with God. His friends, however, interfere with this design, check it, thwart it, prevent him from carrying it out. He must therefore first speak a few words to them. And I desire to reason with God. Compare God's own invitation to his people, \"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord\" (Isaiah 1:18), and again, \"Put me in remembrance, let us plead together; declare thou, that thou mayest be justified\" (Isaiah 43:26); which indicate God's gracious willingness to allow men to plead on their own behalf before him, and do their best to justify themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But ye are forgers of lies. A harsh expression, indicating that Job was thoroughly exasperated. The lies which his friends had forged were, partly, misrepresentations of what he had said, as for example Job 11:4, but mainly statements, more or less covert, which implied that he had brought all his calamities on himself by a course of evil-doing (see Job 4:7, 8; Job 8:13, 14; Job 11:11, 14, 20). Ye are all physicians of no value. Job's friends had come to him to \"comfort\" him (Job 2:11), and act as physicians of his soul. But they had entirely failed to be of the least service. They had not even understood his case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! The friends had \"held their peace\" for seven days after their arrival (Job 2:13). Oh that they would have held it altogether! Their words had done nothing but exasperate and goad almost to madness. There is a mournful pathos in Job's entreates to them to be silent (comp ver. 13). And it should be your wisdom. \"Speech,\" it has been said, \"is silvern, silence is golden.\" No doubt\" there is a time for everything... a time to keep silence, and a time to speak\" (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 7); nor is the rule of La Trappe altogether a wise one. But probably ten times as much harm is done in the world by speaking as by keeping silence. \"Words for God\" need especial care and caution. If they do not do good, the harm that they may do is incalculable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Hear now my reasoning. As his friends have not kept silence, but have spoken, Job claims a right to be heard in his turn. If it be thought that he is somewhat impatient, it must be remembered that his opponents are three to one, all eager to catch him in a fault, and not very mild in their reprimands. And hearken to the pleadings of my lips. Job's \"pleadings\" are addressed, not to his friends, but to God, and are contained in vers. 14-28 of the present, and the whole of the succeeding chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Will ye speak wickedly for God? We are not to suppose that Job's friends consciously used unsound and untrue arguments in their disputations with him on God's behalf. On the contrary, they are to be regarded as convinced of the truth of their own reasonings - as brought up in the firm belief, that temporal prosperity or wretchedness was dealt out by God, immediately, by his own will, to his subjects according to their behaviour. Holding this, they naturally thought that Job, being so greatly afflicted, must be a great sinner, and, as they could not very plausibly allege any open sins against him, they saw in his sufferings a judgment on him for secret sins. \"His chosen friends, as Mr. Froude says, \"wise, good, pious men, as wisdom and piety were then, without one glimpse of the true cause of his sufferings, saw in them a judgment of this character. He became to them an illustration, and even (such are the para-logisms of men of this description) a proof of their theory that 'the prosperity of the wicked is but for a while;' and instead of the comfort and help that they might have brought him, and which in the end they were made to bring him, he is to them no more than a text for the enunciation of solemn falsehood\" ('Short Studies,' vol. 1. p. 300), i.e. of statements which were false, though solemnly believed by them to be true. And talk deceitfully for him. \"Deceitfully,\" because untruly, yet so plausibly as to be likely to deceive others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? Job intends to accuse his opponents of leaning unduly to God's side, and being prepared to justify him in the teeth of reason and justice. This is like the conduct of a judge who should allow his decision to be biassed by favour towards one or the other party in a suit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Is it good that he should search you out? \"Are your motives in thus acting,\" Job asks his opponents, \"so pure that they will stand the severity of God's judgment when he turns his scrutiny upon you and searches out the grounds of your proceedings? Is not your real motive to carry favour with him because he is so great and powerful?\" Or as one man mocketh another, do ye so meek him? You may impose on a man by so acting, but you will not impose on God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. Even though it is his own person which you accept, his own cause that you unduly favour, he, as the God of truth, and Maintainer of right, will assuredly reprove and condemn you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall not his excellency make you afraid! and his dread fall upon you? Will not the very excellency and perfection of God cause you all the more to fear, since they will be arrayed against you? God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, who is no respecter of persons, and hates those who are respecters of persons, will by his very purity and truth be offended at your conduct, and induced to punish it,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Your remembrances are like unto ashes. The \"remembrances\" intended are probably the wise saws, embodiments of the ancient wisdom, on which Job's adversaries have relied in their disputations with him (Job 4:7, 8; Job 8:8-11, etc.). These Job declares to be mere dust and ashes - useless, worthless, such as the first breath of air wilt blow away. Your bodies to bodies of clay; rather, your mounds or your defences (see the Revised Version). These defences, Job says - i.e, the arguments by which his opponents support their views - are no better than \"defences of clay \" - easy to batter down and destroy. The ancient defences of a town were usually either of stone, as at Khorsabad ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 278, 279), or of crude brick faced with burnt brick, as at Babylon and elsewhere. But Job seems to be speaking of something more primitive than either of these - mere earthworks, like the Roman aggera hastily thrown up and easy to level with the ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; literally, be silent from me that I may speak; but our version gives the true meaning. Job repeats the entreaty with which he had bemoan (vers. 5, 6). And let some on me what will. Job is prepared to face the worst. He feels, as he expresses it below (ver. 19), that, if he holds his tongue, he must die. He must speak, and speak he will. After that, let God do as he may please - he will accept his punishment, if God thinks fit to punish him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-28. - The appeal is now to God; but Job prefaces it by excusing his boldness (vers. 14-19). Verse 14. - Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth! An obscure phrase, to be explained by the parallel in the second member of the verse. The general meaning is, \"Why do I jeopardize everything - my body, taking it as it were between my teeth; and my soul, taking it as it were in my hand?\" Neither idea will bear minute analysis; but the latter, at any rate, was known to the Greeks (Athen., 'Deipnosoph.,' p. 569), and is common in English. And put my life in my hand (comp. Judges 12:3; 1 Samuel 19:5; 1 Samuel 28:21; Psalm 119:109).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him; rather, yet will I wait for him. The passage is one of the few in this book where there are two readings - לו איחל and לאֹ איחל. Those who prefer the latter commonly render it, \"I have no hope;\" but it is pointed out by Canon Cook that there are reasons for regarding לֹא as an archaic form for לו, which sometimes takes its place. If this be not allowed the reading לו will have to be preferred, on the double authority of the versions and of the context. Job cannot possibly have said, in one verse, \"I have no hope,\" and in the next, \"He (God) shall be my Salvation.\" But I will maintain mine own ways before him; i.e. \"I will maintain that they are right and good ways, not open to the imputations that my 'friends' have cast upon them\" (Job 4:7, 8; Job 8:6, 20; Job 11:11, 14, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He also shall be my Salvation. Whatever God does to him (ver. 13), whatever burden he lays upon him, though he even \"slay\" him (ver. 15), yet Job is sure that ultimately, in one way or another, God will be his Salvation. It is this determined trustfulness which at once gives Job's character its strength, and atones in a certain sense for his over-boldness in challenging God to a controversy. His heart is right with God. Though the secrets of the unseen world have been hidden from him, and the condition of man after death is a mystery on which he can only form vague conjectures, yet he is sure that in the end God will not fail him. For an hypocrite shall not come before him. If he were a hypocrite the case would be different; he would tremble before God, instead of feeling confident. But, knowing that he is honest and true, he is not afraid; he is bold to \"come before him,\" and plead his cause before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. A last appeal to his opponents to give him their full attention (comp. ver. 6),NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Behold now, I have ordered my cause; i.e. I have prepared my pleadings, and arranged them; I know what I am about to say. Also I know that I shall be justified. I am confident, i.e. that the cause, if it be fully heard, will be decided in my favour. It will appear that I have not brought my calamities upon myself by my own misdoings. Of justification, in the forensic sense, of imputed righteousness, with its concomitant ideas, Job, of course, knows nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Who is he that will plead with me? Will God himself plead? Or will he depute some one, man or angel? Job is impatient that the pleadings should begin. For now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. Some translate, \"For now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost,\" which they explain to mean, \"If God does implead me, I shall take refuge in silence, and straightway expire.\" But this seems an impossible conclusion, when all that Job has been aiming at and striving for since his opponents taxed him with wickedness has been that he might \"speak to the Almighty, and reason with God\" (ver. 3). It is far simpler to keep to the translation of the Authorized Version, and understand Job to mean that things have now reached a point at which he must either speak or expire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Only do not two things unto me. Before beginning his plea, Job has two requests to make of God.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That he will put an end for a time to his bodily sufferings - suspend them, at any rate, while the pleading continues;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he will during the same space abstain from terrifying him mentally, as he had done on previous occasions (Job 6:4; Job 7:14; Job 9:14; see below, ver. 21). Then will I not hide myself from thee; literally, from thy face (comp. Job 9:34, 35, \"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: then would I speak, and not fear him \").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Withdraw thine hand far from me; i.e. \"thy afflicting hand.\" Job views all his physical suffering as coming directly from the hand of God - momentarily caused by him, and therefore removable by him at any moment. He has no thought for secondary causes. And let not thy dread make me afraid. Job speaks here and elsewhere of spiritual terrors - those vague and impalpable fears which suggest themselves inwardly to the soul, and are tar more painful, far more dreadful, than any amount of bodily anguish. Unless he is free from these, as well as from physical pains, he cannot plead his cause freely and fully.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Then call thou, and I will answer. \"Then\" - when I am free from suffering, both mental and bodily - implead me, bring thy charges against me, and I will answer them. As Mr. Fronds observes, \"Job himself had been educated in the same creed\" as his comforters; \"he, too, had been taught to see the hand of God in the outward dispensation\" ('Short Studies,' vol. 1. p. 300). He therefore assumes that God will have a particular charge to make against him, in connection with each of the calamities that have come on him, and he is prepared to face these changes and confute them. At the same time, he is undoubtedly much confused and perplexed, not knowing how to reconcile his traditional belief with his internal consciousness of innocence. Or let me speak, and answer thou me. \"Let me,\" i.e. \"take the initiative, if thou preferrest it so - let me ask the questions, and do thou answer.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - How many are mine iniquities and sins? This is scarcely, as Professor Stanley Leathes represents it, \"a deep confession of personal sin\" ('Old Testament Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 27). It is more in the nature of a remonstrance. \"These sins of mine, for which I. am so grievously punished, what are they? Name them. How many are there of them? Let me know exactly what they are; and then I can question my conscience concerning them.\" Make me to know my transgression and my sin. These words imply that lie does not know them at present. He knows of some infirmities and lighter misdoings of his youth (ver. 26); but he knows of no such sins as are commensurate with his sufferings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? What is thy reason for withdrawing from me the light of thy countenance, and behaving towards me as though thou weft mine enemy? Job does not believe God to be his enemy. He knows that God will one day be his Salvation (ver. 16); but he recognizes a present alienation, and desires to be made acquainted with the cause of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? Job compares himself to two of the weakest things in nature - a withered leaf, and a morsel of dry stubble. He cannot believe that God will employ his almighty strength in crushing and destroying what is so slight and feeble. A deep sense of God's goodness and compassion underlies the thought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For thou writest bitter things against me. The allusion seems to be to the ordinary practice in ancient law-courts of formulating a written acte d'accusation against supposed criminals. Keeping up the imagery of a court and pleadings, Job represents God as engaged in drawing up such a document against him. The \"bitter things\" are the charges which the acts contains. And makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. Job, like David, has to acknowledge \"sins and offences\" committed in his youth (Psalm 25:6). In considering what the indictment against him can be, he can only suppose that these old and long-forsaken sins are being remembered and brought up against him, and that he is being punished for them. He does not exclaim against this as injustice; he feels probably that there is no statute of limitations respecting sins and their punishment; but it can scarcely have seemed to him consistent with God's goodness and mercifulness that the offences of his immature age should be visited upon him so bitterly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks (comp. Job 33:11). The punishment is said to be still in use among the Bedouin Arabs. It was well known to the Israelites (Proverbs 7:22; Jeremiah 20:2; Jeremiah 29:26), to the Greeks (Herod., 9:87), and to the Romans (Acts 16:24). And lookest narrowly unto all my paths. Not allowing me to escape thee. Thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet; rather, upon the soles of my feet. The \"print\" intended is probably a mark which the stocks were in the habit of making (see Professor Sayee, in Sunday at Home December, 1890, p. 125).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob13:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And he. The change of person is very strange, but not unknown to the Hebrew idiom. It is impossible that any one but Job himself can be meant. As a rotten thing consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten. An allusion to the character of the disease from which he is suffering.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMan that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-22. - This chapter, in which Job concludes the fourth of his addresses, is characterized by a tone of mild and gentle expostulation, which contrasts with the comparative vehemence and passion of the two preceding chapters. It would seem that the patriarch, having vented his feelings, experiences a certain relief, an interval of calm, in which, his own woes pressing less heavily upon him, he is content to moralize on the general condition of humanity. Verse 1. - Man that is born of a woman. In this fact Job sees the origin of man's inherent weakness. He is \"born of a woman,\" who is \"the weaker vessel\" (1 Peter 3:7). He is conceived by her in uncleanness (Psalm 51:5; comp. below, ver. 4), brought forth in sorrow and pain (Genesis 3:16) suckled at her breasts, placed for years under her guidance. No wonder that he shares the weakness of which she is a sort of type. Is of few days; literally, short of days. Length and shortness of days are, no doubt, relative; and it is difficult to say what term of life would not have seemed short to men as they looked back upon it. To Jacob, at the age of a hundred and thirty, it appeared that \"few and evil had the days of the years of his life been\" (Genesis 47:9). Methuselah, perhaps, thought the same. We all, as we come towards old age, and death draws manifestly near, feel as if we had only just begun to live, as if, at any rate, we had not done half our work, and were about to be cut off before our time. But would the case be seriously different if our tale of years were doubled? And fall of trouble (comp. Job 5:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down. Few similes are more frequently used in Scripture (comp. Psalm 103:15; Isaiah 28:1, 4; Isaiah 40:6, 7; James 1:10, 11; 1 Peter 1:24), and certainly none could have more poetic beauty. Eastern flowers do not often last much more than a day. He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not (comp. Job 7:2; Job 8:9; 1 Chronicles 29:15; Psalm 102:11; Psalm 109:23; Ecclesiastes 6:12, etc.). Shadows are always changing; but the shadows which flee away the fastest, and which Job has probably in his mind, are those of clouds, or other moving objects, which seem to chase each other over the earth, and never to continue for a single minute in one stay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one? Is it compatible with God's greatness, unchangeableness, and majesty to take any notice of so poor, weak, and unstable a creature as mortal man? The question has been often asked, and answered by many in the negative, as by the Epicureans of old. Job does not really entertain any doubt upon the point; but only intends to express his wonder that it should be so (comp. Psalm 8:4, and above, Job 7:17). And bringest me into judgment with thee? Especially astonishing is it, Job says, that God should condescend to try, pass judgment on, and punish so weak, worthless, and transitory a creature as himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. It is scarcely true to say that \"the fact of original sin is thus distinctly recognized\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 61). Original uncleanness and infirmity are recognized; but the uncleanness is material, and removable by material expiation (Leviticus 12:2-8). It is rather man's weakness than his sinfulness that is here under discussion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Seeing his days are determined. Job here returns to the consideration of the shortness of man's life. \"His days are determined;\" i.e. they are a limited period, known to and fixed beforehand by God. They are not like God's days, which \"endure throughout all generations\" (Psalm 102:24). The number of his months are with thee. \"With thee\" means here \"known to thee,\" \"laid up in thy counsels.\" Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass. \"His bounds\" are \"the limit of his lifetime.\" The three clauses are pleonastic. One idea pervades them all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Turn from him, that he may rest; literally, look away from him; i.e. \"Cease to watch him and search him out so continually\" (comp. Job 7:17, 18). \"Then he will be able to have a breathing-time, an interval of peace and rest, before his departure from the earth.\" What Job had previously desired for himself (Job 10:20) he now asks for all humanity. Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. Hired labourers are glad when their day's work is over. So man rejoices when life comes to an end. Ver 7. - For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down. God's vegetable creation is better off, in respect of length of days, than man. Let a tree be cut down, it is not therefore of necessity destroyed. There is yet hope for it. The bare dry stump will sometimes put forth tender branches, which will grow and flourish, and renew the old life. Or, if the stump be quite dead, suckers may spring up from the root and grow into new trees as vigorous as the one that they replace (comp. Isaiah 11:1). Herodotus considered that all trees had this recuperative power, except the πίτυς, a species of fir (Herod., 6:37), and the traveller Shaw says that when a palm tree dies there is always a sucker ready to take its place. Pliny also observes of the laurel, \"Viva-cissima est radix, ita ut, si truncus ina-ruerit, recisa arbor mox laetius frutificet\" ('Hist. Nat.,' 1:15. § 30). That it will sprout again. That is, from the spool or stump. Some trees, as the Spanish chest. nut, if cut down flush with the ground, throw up shoots from the entire circle of the stomp, often as many as fifteen or twenty. And that the tender branch thereof will not cease. The vigour of such shoots is very great. In a few years they grow to the height of the parent tree. If they are then removed they are quickly replaced by a fresh growth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. After the stump is actually dead, suckers may be thrown up from the roots, if sufficient water be supplied to them; and these will put forth branches luxuriantly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But man dieth. \"Man\" is here גבר, \"the brave, strong man,\" not אדם or אנושׁ, and the meaning is that man, however brave and' strong, perishes. And wasteth away; i.e. \"comes to nought, remains no strength or vitality.\" Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? \"Where is he?\" Job could not answer this question. He might say, \"In Sheol.\" But where was Sheol, and what was Sheol? There was no written revelation on this subject, and no traditional knowledge on which dependence could be placed. The Hebrew notions on the subject were very vague and indeterminate; Job's notions are likely to have been still vaguer. There is no reason to believe that he had any exact acquaintance with the tenets of the Egyptians. He may have known the Chaldean teaching, but it would not have carried him very far(see above, pp. 178, 179). Doubt and perplexity beset him whenever he turned his attention to the problem of man's condition after death, and, excepting when carried away by a burst of enthusiasm, he seems to have regarded it as the highest wisdom, in matters of this kind, \"to knew that he knew nothing.\" The question, \"Where is he?\" is an acknowledgment of this profound ignorance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As the waters fail from the sea. The allusion seems to be to the actual desiccation of seas and rivers. Job, apparently, had known instances of both. A formation of new land in the place, of sea is always going on at the head of the Persian Gulf, through the deposits of the Tigris and Euphrates; and this formation was very rapid in ancient times, when the head of the gulf was narrower. The desiccation of river-courses is common in Mesopotamia, where arms thrown out by the Tigris and Euphrates get blocked, and then silted up. And the flood decayeth and drieth up; rather, and the river decayeth etc. (see the comment on the preceding clause).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - So man lieth down, and riseth not. This is not an absolute denial of a final resurrection, since Job is speaking of the world as it lies before him, not of eventualities. Just as he sees the land encroach upon the sea, and remain land, and the river-courses, once dried up, remain dry, so he sees men descend into the grave and remain there, without rising up again. This is the established order of nature as it exists before his eyes. Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake. This order of things, Job believes, rightly enough, will continue as long as the heavens and the earth endure. What will happen afterwards he does not so much as inquire. It is remarked, ingeniously, that Job's words, though not intended in this sense, exactly \"coincide with the declarations of the New Testament, which make the resurrection simultaneous with the breaking up of the visible universe\" (Canon Cook). Nor be raised out of their sleep. If \"the glimmer of a hope\" of the resurrection appears anywhere in vers. 10-12, it is in the comparison of death to a sleep, which is inseparably connected in our minds with an awakening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave! literally, in Sheol which here does not so much mean \"the grave,\" as the place of departed spirits, described in Job 10:21, 22. Job desires to have God's protection in that\" land of darkness,\" and to be \"hidden\" there by him until his wrath be past. It has been generally supposed that he means after his death; but Schultens thinks his desire was to descend to Sheol alive and there remain, while his punishment continued, hidden from the eyes of men. That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past. Job assumes that, if he is being punished for his youthful sins (Job 13:26), his punishment will not be for long - at any rate, not for ever; God's anger will at last be satisfied and cease. That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! How long he may have to suffer be does not greatly care. Only let it be \"a set time\" - a fixed, definite period - and at the end of it, let God\" remember\" him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If a man die, shall he live again? The question is clearly intended to be answered in the negative. It is not a dispassionate inquiry, but an expression of hopelessness. Let a man once die, and of course he cannot live again. Were it otherwise, then, Job says, all the days of my appointed time will I wait; or, rather (as in the Revised Version), all the days of my warfare would I wait; i.e. I would patiently endure any sufferings in the larger hope that would then be open to me. I would wait till my change (rather, my renewal) come. The exact nature of the 'renewal\" which Job seems here to expect is obscure. Perhaps he is pursuing the idea, broached in ver. 13, of his being conveyed alive to Hades, and looks forward to a furthur renewed life after he is released from that \"land of darkness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee; rather, thou shouldest call, and I would answer thee (see the Revised Version). In that case, when I quitted Hades, and renewed my life, thou wouldst assuredly summon me to thee, and I would respond to the summons. There would be sweet colloquy between us; for thou wilt (or, rather, wouldest) have a desire to the work of thine hands (comp. ch. 10:8-11). Job assumes that God must love whatever he has created, and be drawn towards it by a secret, strong desire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For now thou numberest my steps; rather, but now. Job, at this point, proceeds to contrast his actual condition with the ideal one which (in vers. 13-15) his imagination has conjured up. God's actual attitude towards him he regards as one, not of protecting love, but of jealous hostility. His \"steps\" are observed, counted - every divergence from the right path is noted - a false step, if he makes one, is at once punished. Dost thou not watch over my sin? (comp. Job 10:14). Job's sins, he thinks, are watched for, spied out, taken note of, and remembered against him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - My transgression is sealed up in a bag (comp. Deuteronomy 32:34); i.e. God keeps account of all my transgressions. It is as if he put them all into a bag (compare \"Put my tears into thy bottle,\" Psalm 56:8), whence they can be taken out and brought against me at any moment. They are \"sealed up\" in the bag for greater security. And thou sewest up mine iniquity. (So Ewald, Dillmaun, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version.) Others think the meaning to be, \"Thou addest to my iniquity [continually];\" i.e. by placing fresh sins to my account. (So Schultens and Rosenmuller.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought. Job here resumes the lament 'over human infirmity, with which the chapter opens (vers. 1-12); but he has, perhaps, in this passage, his own case mote distinctly presented to his consciousness. With the wealth of metaphor which characterizes his utterances, he compares the ruin of a prosperous manNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to the sudden collapse of a mountain;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to the removal of a rock out of its place;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) to the wearing away of stones by the constant flow of streams; andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) to the destruction of alluvial tracts by floods.NEWLINENEWLINEMountains collapse, either by volcanic agency, which is quite as much shown in the subsidence as in the elevation of the soil, or by landslips, which are most usually the results of heavy rains. And the rock is removed out of his place. Rocks are sometimes split by frost, and topple over when a thaw comes; at other times, heavy floods remove them from their accustomed place; occasionally earthquakes overturn them, and cause them to fall with a crash. There is also a removal of rocks to much greeter distances, by means of glaciers and icebergs; but of these Job is not likely to have known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The waters wear the stones. The power of the soft element of water, by continual washing or dripping, to wear away the hardest stone, has often been noticed, and is a frequent topic in poetry. Deep ravines have been worn in course of time, through broad and lofty mountain ranges by rivers, the stone yielding little by little to the action of the water, until at last a broad chasm is made. So the continual wearing action of calamity often lays low the prosperous. Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; rather, as in the Revised Version, the overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth; i.e. \"overflows of water, inundations, floods, not only make a way through rocks, but often carry off great tracts of rich soil, hurrying the alluvium down to the sea, and leaving in its place a marsh or a waste.\" And thou destroyest the hope of man. Even thus from time to time does God ruin and destroy the hopes of a prosperous man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thou prevailset for ever against him, and he passsth; rather, thou puttest forth thy power against him perpetually; i.e. thou art continually oppressing him, and crushing him by afflictions; and the consequence is that \"he passes;\" i.e. \"he passes away, disappears, ceases to be.\" Thou changest his countenance. \"Alterest,\" i.e, \"its expression from cheerfulness to sadness, and its complexion from the hue of health to the sickly pallor of disease; settest the stamp of death upon it, and further dis-figurest it in the dreadful process of decay.\" And sendest him away. That is to say, \"Thou removest him from the earth, dismissest him to Sheol, where thenceforth he remains?'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not. The meaning seems to be, \"If his sons come to honour, it is of no advantage to him; in the remote and wholly separate region of Sheol he will not be aware of it.\" The view is more dismal than that of Aristotle, who argues that the fate of those whom they have loved and left on earth will be sure to penetrate, in course of time (ἐπὶ τινα χρόνον)' to the departed, and cause them a certain amount of joy or sorrow ('Eth. Nic.,' 1:11). And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. Equally, in the opposite case, if his sons are brought low, he is ignorant of it, and unaffected by their fate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - But his flesh upon him shall have pain. The best rendering is probably that which is placed in the margin of the Revised Version, only for himself his flesh hath pain, and for himself his soul mourneth. Nothing more is intended than to negative the idea that the future condition of his children will seriously affect a man who is suffering under God's afflicting hand, either in this life or afterwards. He cannot but be occupied solely with himself. His own sufferings, whether of body or mind, win absorb all his attention.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, Should a wise man utter vain knowledge! literally, knowledge of wind - knowledge, i.e. which is vain, idle, inflated, without solidity or substance. Job, as setting up to be \"a wise man,\" should not have indulged in such empty and foolish speaking. It is observable that Eliphaz does not point out what part of Job's discourses he considers objectionable, but condemns the whole of them under this broad and general description, which even he could not have regarded as applicable to more than a portion of what Job had said. And fill his belly with the east wind? The east wind was regarded as the worst of winds. In Palestine it blew from the great Syrian and North Arabian desert, and was of the nature of a sirocco. (On its deleterious effects, see Genesis 41:6, 23; Jeremiah 18:17; Ezekiel 17:10; Ezekiel 19:12; Ezekiel 27:26; Hosea 13:15, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Should he reason with unprofitable talk! Such, Eliphaz implies, had been Job's talk, altogether idle and unprofitable. A wise man should have abstained from such profitless arguments. They were speeches wherewith he could do no good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Yea, thou castest off fear. To Eliphaz, Job's words - his bold expostulations (Job 13:3, 15, 22, etc.), his declarations that he knows he will be justified (Job 13:8), and that God will be his Salvation (Job 13:16) - seem to imply that he has cast off altogether the fear of God, and is entirely devoid of reverence. Some of his expressions certainly seem over-bold; but, on the other hand, his sense of God's purity, perfectness, and transcendent power is continually manifest, and should have saved him from the rude reproach here launched against him (comp. Job 9:1-13; Job 12:24 25; 13:11, 21, etc.). And restrainest prayer before God; rather, and hinderest devout meditation before God. Eliphaz means that Job expresses himself in a way so cf. fensive to devout souls, that he disturbs their minds and prevents them from indulging in those pious meditations on the Divine goodness which would otherwise occupy them (comp. Psalm 119:97). Thus, according to Eliphaz, Job is not only irreligious himself, but the cause of irreligion in others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity. Some render, \"Thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth,\" causing it to utter such profane speeches (Vulgate, Dillmann, Canon Cook, Revised Version); but the translation of the Authorized Version is defensible on grammatical grounds, and yields a good sense, so that no alteration is necessary. And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty; or, the tongue of the subtle (comp. Genesis 3:1, where the epithet assigned to the serpent is the same). Eliphaz probably means to tax Job with cloaking his real impiety under a pretence of religiousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thine own mouth condemneth thee. So of a greater than Job it was said, \"He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death\" (Matthew 26:65, 66). Malevolence delights in misunderstanding and misinterpreting the utterances of the righteous. And not I. A weak disclaimer! As if Job's supposed guilt did not depend on the construction put upon his words. Yea, thine own lips testify against thee. Therefore, \"what further need of witnesses?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArt thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Art thou the first man that was born? That is, \"Dost thou claim to have the wisdom of that first human intelligence, which, proceeding direct from God (Genesis 1:27), was without fault or flaw - a perfect intelligence, which judged all things aright?\" It is not clear that Eliphaz had ever heard of Adam; but he evidently believed in a \"first man,\" from whom all others were descended, and he attributed to this first man a mind and intellect surpassing those of all other men. His question is, of course, rather a scoff than an inquiry. He knows that Job makes no such foolish pretence; but he throws it in his teeth that, from what he has said, men might suppose he took some such view of himself. Or wast thou made before the hills? This is a taunt of the same kind as the previous one, but intensified. Wisdom is the result of experience. Art thou older than all the rest of us - older than the earth itself, than \"the everlasting hills\"? There were Greeks who claimed to be ethnically προσέληνοι, \"older than the moon,\" but no inhabitant of earth was ever so foolish as to imagine himself individually more ancient than the earth on which he lived.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Hast thou heard the secret of God? or, Hast thou been a hearer in the secret counsel of God? (comp. Jeremiah 23:18, \"Who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived and hoard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?\"). No mortal man was ever admitted to the secret counsel of the Most Highest (comp. Romans 11:34). And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? or, Dost thou confine (appropriate) wisdom to thyself? i.e. Dost thou suppose that thou art the only wise man in all the world? (comp. Job 12:2, where Job had brought the same charge against his three friends).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - What knowest thou, that we know not? So far as worldly wisdom went, this was probably quite true. Job was not more advanced in knowledge than Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. But he had a keener spiritual insight. He was wiser in the \"wisdom which is from above.\" Perplexed and confused as were his thoughts concerning the Divine government of the universe, they were nearer the truth, more worthy of the Divine nature, than those of his adversaries. In his reply, without claiming any special wisdom, he pours contempt on their pretensions to spiritual understanding (Job 17:4, 10). What understandest thou, which is not in us? A mere repetition of the first member of the verse in different words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - With us are both the greyheaded and very aged men. \"With us\" seems to mean \"of our party,\" or \"on our side.\" Eliphaz claims that all the greybeards of the time, as well as all the ancient men of past times (comp. Job 8:8, and below, ver. 18), are on his side. and think as he does. Much elder than thy father. Men, i.e. not merely of the preceding, but of much more distant generations His Latin to be supported by the voice of antiquity was, no doubt, in strict accordance with fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Are the consolations of God small with thee? By \"the consolations of God\" Eliphaz probably means the hopes which he and his friends had held out, speaking in God's Name, that if Job would humble himself, and confess his guilt, and sue to God for pardon, he would be restored to favour, recover his prosperity, and live to a good old age in tranquil happiness (see Job 5:18-27; Job 8:20-22; Job 11:13-19). He wishes to know if Job thinks lightly of all this, regards it as of small account, will make no effort to obtain the blessings held out to him. This is all reasonable enough from his standpoint, that Job is conscious of secret heinous guilt; but it can make no impression on Job, who is conscious of the reverse. Is there any secret thing with thee? rather, And is the word [of small account that dealeth] gently with thee? Eliphaz considers that his own words and those of his two companions have been soft words, dealing \"gently\" with Job's refractoriness, and that Job ought to have been impressed by them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Why doth thine heart carry thee away? or, Whither doth thine heart carry thee away? i.e. to what a pitch of presumption and audacity do thy proud thoughts carry thee? And what do thy eyes wink at? or, Wherefore do thy eyes roll? The verb used occurs only in this place. Its meaning is very doubtful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13 - That thou turnest thy spirit against God. To Eliphaz and his companions, the wild remonstrances of Job, his vehement expostulations and despairing outcries, are, one and all, nothing better than indications of a proud and rebellious spirit, that sets itself up against the Almighty, and openly contends with him. They view Job, after the speeches that he has made, as a declared rebel, and no longer regard it as incumbent upon them to use any \"gentleness\" in their reprimands. And lettest such words go out of thy mouth? It is remarkable that neither Eliphaz nor either of his friends ever points out what particular words of Job they object to and regard as impious, so as to give him the opportunity of defending, explaining, or retracting them. They take refuge in vague generalities, with which it is impossible to grapple. But this vagueness and want of logical accuracy is characteristic of the Oriental nations, who scarcely ever reason cogently or bring matters to a point.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - What is man, that he should be clean? A vain \"beating of the air.\" Eliphaz had asserted the same truth in his first speech, when he said, \"Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he taxeth with folly: how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?\" (Job 4:17-19); and Job had given his full assent to it, when he exclaimed, \"I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand\" (Job 9:2, 3). The true question was not whether Job or any other man was\" clean,\" i.e. wholly sinless but whether Job had sinned so deeply and grievously that his sufferings were the natural and just punishment for his sins. And a mere repetition of the statement that all men were sinful and unclean was off the point - nihil ad rem-altogether futile and superfluous. And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? (setup. Job 25:4). The clause is a mere variant of the preceding one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; rather, in his holy ones (see the Revised Version). The word \"saint\" has in course of time come to be so exclusively attached to holy men' that it can no longer be applied, without danger of being misunderstood, to angels. Eliphaz here, as in Job 5:1, speaks not of holy men, but of the holy angels. Without taxing them with sin, he is strongly convinced of their imperfection - their defective wisdom (Job 5:18), weakness, and untrustworthiness. His views are decidedly peculiar, and not borne out by the rest of Scripture. Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. The material heavens are probably intended. That limpid liquid blue in which the human eye sees no stain or speck, to the Divine eye is tinged with uncleanness The idea is that neither animate nor inanimate nature contains any form of being that is absolutely without spot or blemish. In God alone is there perfect purity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? rather, How much less one that is abominable and impure a man that drinketh in iniquity etc.? It cannot be doubted that Job is individually pointed at. Not mankind generally, but a particular man, is intended; and the particular man can be none other than Job. Thus we see how the progress of the controversy has tended to exasperate the disputants, and change the \"comforters\" from smooth-tongued friends into open enemies and accusers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will show thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare. Eliphaz here introduces, with an elaborate preface (vers. 17-19) what is either a citation from a book, as Professor Lee thinks, or a studied description by himself of the proceedings and consequent sufferings of the wicked. This description extends from ver. 20 to the end of the chapter, and is plainly levelled at Job, though it may originally have been intended to apply to some other person or persons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it (comp. Job 8:8-10). Whether the words are his own or not, the sentiments, at any rate, Eliphaz declares to have come down to him from remote times. The \"wise men\" to whom he refers may have been men of the Beni Kedem (Job 1:3). who were noted for their wisdom (1 Kings 4:30), or possibly Egyptians or Babylonians. Books containing moral aphorisms and instructions were certainly composed both in Egypt and in Babyhmia at a very ancient date (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 3. p. 135; vol. 7. pp. 119-122).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Unto whom alone the earth was given. The reference is clearly to a very remote time, when men were comparatively few, and lived in quiet possession of their own lands, undisturbed by invasions, wars, or struggles for territory. Professor Lee thinks that the times immediately after, and even those before, the Flood are glanced at; while Schultens regards Eliphaz as alluding to the first settlements of the Joktanidae in Arabia. In either case, the passage tells in favour or, and not against, the antiquity of the Book of Job, since it marks the composer as \"living at a time when the memory of an age of patriarchal simplicity was yet fresh in men's minds\" (Canon Cook). And no stranger passed among them. Races were not mixed up one with another, and so the purity of primitive doctrine remained undisturbed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-35. - Schultens calls this \"a magnificently elaborate oration, crowded with illustrations and metaphors, in which it is shown that the wicked cannot possibly escape being miserable, but that the punishment which they have so richly deserved assuredly awaits them, and is to be inflicted on them, as an example and terror to others, by a holy and just God, because, just as he loves virtue, so he pursues vice with a fierce and deadly hatred\" ('Liber Jobi,' p. 104, edit. R. Grey). Verse 20. - The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days. Certainly an over-statement of the truth. With a much nearer approach to the facts of the case, the Psalmist remarked, \"I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity. For they are in no peril of death, but are lusty and strong. They come in no misfortune like other folk; neither are they plagued like other men\" (Psalm 73:3-5). And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor; rather, even the number of years that is laid up for the oppressor. So Merx and the Revised Version. Another possible meaning is, \"And a [small] number of years is laid up,\" etc. If we take the former view, we must regard the clause as exegetical of \"all his days.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - A dreadful sound is in his ears; literally, a sound of terrors. Fears of all kinds beset him, lest he should lose his prosperity. Sometimes they seem actually to sound in his ears. Prosper as he may, he feels that in prosperity the destroyer shall one day come upon him. \"The destroyer\" may be either the destroying angel, or the avenger of blood, or a robber-chief at the head of a band of marauders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness. He has no hope of recovering his prosperity, when calamity has once stricken him down, since he knows that his calamity is deserved, and feels that it is God's judgment upon him for his sins. And he is waited for of the sword. He feels as if an enemy was lying in wait for him at every turn, with his sword drawn, ready to slay him. Professor Lee compares the words of Cain, \"It shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me\" (Genesis 4:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? This, again, might appropriately have been said of Cain, who was \"a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth\" (Genesis 4:14), and may at times have had difficulty in procuring his daily bread. At any rate, it is the frequent experience of the wicked who lose their ill-gotten gains, and are brought down to abject poverty, and actual want of the necessaries of life. \"He wanders abroad to be the food of vultures\" is a translation of the passage suggested by some moderns (as Merx), and has the support of the Septuagint, κατατέτακται εῖς σῖτα ψυψίν. But it requires a slight change in the pointing. He knoweth that the day of darkness is nigh at hand. \"The day of darkness\" is probably the day of his decease: this he \"knows,\" or at any rate, surmises, to be near.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. Eliphaz seems covertly to allude to Job's misfortunes, which came against him with such force, and crushed him as a mighty king crushes his foes in battle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For he stretcheth out his hand against God. The wicked man ventures even to threaten the Almighty. So in Eastern legend Nimrod was supposed to have done, and in Greek legend the giants. And strengtheneth himself against the Almighty; rather, behaveth himself proudly. See the Revised Version, and compare Schultens, who renders the Hebrew יתגבּר, by \"ferocius et insolentius se gessit.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He runneth upon him, even on his neck; rather, with his neck. It is not God who runneth upon the wicked man, as our translators seem to have supposed, but the wicked man who rushes furiously against God. Like an infuriated bull, he makes his charge with his neck, i.e. with head lowered and neck stiffened, thinking to carry all before him. Upon the thick bosses of his bucklers; rather, with the thick bosses of his shield The metaphor of the bull is dropped, and God's enemy represented as charging him like a warrior, with the shield-arm outstretched, and the heavy bosses of the shield pressing him down.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Because he covereth his face with his fatness. The ground and origin of the wicked man's audacity is his luxurious and intemperate living. In the days of his prosperity he pampered his body, freely indulged all his carnal appetites, and gave himself up to gluttony and gourmandism. This depraved his moral nature, separated between him and God, and finally produced in him the insolence and presumption described in vers. 25, 26 And maketh collops of fat on his flanks. The same idea, only very slightly varied, as so often in the second member of a verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And he dwelleth in desolate cities. Blot only was he sensual and gluttenous, but he was covetous and rapacious also. He dwelt in cities which his hand had desolated - in houses which no man inhabiteth - since he had driven their owners from them - and which were ready to become heaps, i.e. were in a ruinous condition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - He shall not be rich; i.e. he shall not increase, or maintain, his riches. Neither shall his substance continue, His riches shall make themselves wings, and take their departure. Neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth; rather, neither shall their possessions be extended upon the earth. (So Rosenmuller, Professor Lee, and Renan.) The transition from the singular to the plural is not unusual, when it is a class, and not an individual, that is really spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - He shall not depart out of darkness (comp. ver. 23, where the wicked man is threatened with \"a day of darkness\"). When the darkness once falls, it shall continue; there shall be no escaping out of it The flame shall dry up his branches; rather, a flame. The \"flame\" intended seems to be the wrath of God. ' And by the breath of his mouth; i.e. \"of God's mouth\" (comp. Job 4:9). Shall he go away; or, pass away; i.e. disappear, be consumed, perish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity; rather, let him not trust in vanity (or, in falsehood)' deceiving himself (see the Revised Version). All the supports and stays of the wicked are vanity - unsubstantial, futile, utterly vain and useless. It is only a man who \"deceives himself\" that can trust in them. For vanity shall be his recompense. Such as do so trust gain nothing by it; they sow vanity and reap vanity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - It shall be accomplished before his time. \"It [i.e. the recompense] shall be accomplished [or, 'paid in full '] before its time [i.e. before payment is due].\" A vague threat, probably intended to signify that death will come upon the wicked man prematurely, before he has lived out halt the days of his natural life. And his branch shall not be green; i.e. he shall wither and fade, like a tree not planted by the waterside (Psalm 1:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine. Blight and untimely cold cause the vine to drop its grapes before they are mature. So the wicked man will be deprived, one by one, of his possessions. And shall cast off his flower as the olive. The olive often sheds its blossoms in vast numbers. \"In spring,\" says Canon Tristram, \"one may see the bloom, on the slightest breath of wind, shed like snowflakes, and perishing by millions\" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 375). According to some commentators, this happens regularly in alternate years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate; or, shall be sterile or barren like the vine and olive of the preceding verse. The entire company of the wicked shall suffer this punishment. And fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. God's lightning shall fall from heaven, and burn up the tents (i.e. the habitations) of those who take bribes to pervert justice. It is suggested that Eliphaz intends to accuse Job of the two secret sins of hypocrisy and corruption.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob15:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity; rather, as in the margin, iniquity. And their belly prepareth deceit. Internally, i.e. in their inner nature - in their heart, as we should any - they make ready deceits. \"The viscera,\" as Professor Lee observes, \"are often made by the Hebrews the seat of thought.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2.. - Then Job answered and said, I have heard many such things. There was nothing new in the second speech of Eliphaz, if we except its increased bitterness. Job had heard all the commonplaces about the universal sinfulness of man, and the invariable connection between sin and suffering, a thousand times before. It was the traditional belief in which he and all those about him had been brought up. But it brought him no relief. The reiteration of it only made him feel that there was neither comfort nor instruction to be got from his so-called \"comforters.\" Hence his outburst. Miserable comforters are ye all!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Shall vain words have an end? literally, as in the margin, words of wind; i.e. words which pass by a man \"as the idle wind which he regards not.\" Will his friends never bring their futile speaking to a close? Or what emboldeneth thee that thou anwerest? rather, what provoketh thee? (Revised Version) Job had begged that his friends would be silent (Job 13:5, 13). He supposes that they would have complied with his wish if he had not provoked them, but professes an inability to see what provocation he had given. His last speech, however, had certainly not been conciliatory (see Job 12:1-3; Job 13:4, 7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you. It is only too easy to heap up rhetorical declamation against an unfortunate sufferer, whose physical and mental agonies absorb almost his whole attention. If you were in my place and condition, and I in yours, I could moralize in your tone and spirit for hours. And shake my head at you. A Hebrew mode of expressing condemnation of a man's conduct (see Psalm 22:7; Isaiah 37:22; Jeremiah 18:16; Matthew 27:39, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But I would strengthen you with my mouth. The meaning is somewhat doubtful, and different renderings have been proposed. But the rendering of the Authorized Version is quite defensible, and is accepted by our Revisers. This gives the sense, \"I, if I were in your place, would not act as you have acted, but, on the contrary, would do my best to strengthen you with words of comfort and encouragement.\" The moving of my lips should assuage your grief. (So Rosenmuller and our Revisers.) The words are a covert reproach of the three \"friends\" for not acting as Job declares that he would have acted if the positions had been reversed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased! As it is, nor speech nor silence are of any avail. Neither of them brings me any relief. My sufferings continue as before, whichever course I take.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But now. These words mark a transition. Job turns from complaints against his \"comforters\" to an enumeration of his own sufferings. He hath made me weary. God has afflicted him with an intolerable sense of weariness. He is tired of life; tired of disputing with his friends; tired even of pouring out his lamentations and complaints and expostulations to God. His one desire is rest. So I have seen in the piombi of Venice, where political prisoners were tortured by cold and heat, and hunger and thirst, for long weeks or months, and brought to despair, such scratchlags as the following: \"Luigi A. implora pace, Giuseppe B. implore eterna quiete.\" Job has entreated for this boon of rest repeatedly (Job 3:13; Job 6:9; Job 7:15; Job 10:18, etc.). Thou hast made desolate all my company. The loss of his children has desolated his household; his other afflictions have alienated his friends.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And thou hast filled me with wrinkles. So St. Jerome, Professor Lee, Dr. Stanley Leathes, and others; but the generality of modern commentators prefer the rendering, \"Thou hast bound me fast,\" i.e. deprived me of all power of resisting or moving (comp. Psalm 88:8, \"I am so fast in prison that I cannot get forth\"). Which is a witness against me; i.e. a witness of thy displeasure, and so (as men suppose) of my guilt. And my leanness rising up in me heareth witness to my face; rather, my leanness rising up against me. This emaciation is taken as another witness of his extreme sinfulness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me; literally, his wrath teareth and he hateth me. God treats Job as severely as if he hated him. That he is actually hated of God Job does not believe; otherwise he would long since have ceased to call upon him, and pour out his heart before him. He gnasheth upon me with his teeth (comp. Psalm 35:16; Psalm 37:12). Mine enemy (or rather, adversary) sharpeneth his eyes upon me; i.e. makes me a whetstone on which he sharpens his angry glances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They have gaped upon me with their mouth. The \"man of sorrows\" of the Old Testament is, in many respects, a type of the \"Man of sorrows\" of the New; and, in the Messianic psalms, David constantly applies to Christ expressions which Job had used in reference to himself (see Psalm 22:13). They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully (comp. Micah 5:1; Matthew 27:30; Luke 22:64; John 18:22). They have gathered themselves together against me (see Psalm 35:15, and compare, in illustration of the literal and historical sense, Job 30:1, 10-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - God hath delivered me to the ungodly. All that Job had suffered at the hands of wicked men, the gibes of his \"comforters,\" the insults and \"derision ' of \"base men\" (Job 30:1, 8-10), the desertion of many who might have been expected to have come to his aid, being by God's per-minion, is attributed by Job to God himself, who has \"delivered\" him up to these \"ungodly\" ones, and permits them to add to and intensify his sufferings. He was not so ruthlessly treated as his great Anti-type; he was not bound with thongs, or crowned with thorns, or smitten with a reed, or scourged, or crucified - even the smiting on the cheek, spoken of in ver. 10, was probably metaphorical; but he suffered, no doubt, grievously, through the scorn and contumely that assailed him, through his friends' unkindness, and his enimies' insolent triumph, and the rude jeers of the \"abjeets\" who made him their \"song\" and their \"byword\" (Job 30:9). And turned me over into the hands of the wicked. Job speaks as if God had wholly given him up, made him over to the wicked, to deal with him exactly as they chose. This, of course, was not so. If the malevolence of Satan was limited by the Divine will (Job 1:12; Job 2:6); so, much more, would the malevolence of man be limited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I was at ease (compare the picture drawn in Job 1:1-5). Job had been \"at ease,\" tranquil, prosperous, happy. He had been almost without a care, when suddenly \"trouble came.\" But he hath broken me asunder; rather, he brake me asunder (see the Revised Version). In the midst of his ease and tranquillity, God suddenly poured out his chastisements, and \"brake Job asunder,\" i.e. destroyed his life, ruined it and broke it down. He hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces; or, dashed me to pieces. And set me up for his mark; i.e. as a target for his arrows (comp. Deuteronomy 32:23; Job 6:4; Psalm 7:13; Psalm 38:2, etc.; Lamentations 3:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - His archers compass me round about. God is represented, not as himself the shooter of the arrows, but as surrounding Job with a body of archers, who are under his command and carry out his will. So, generally, Scripture represents the judgments of God as carried out by interior agents (see 2 Samuel 24:16; 1 Chronicles 21:15; 2 Kings 19:35, etc.). He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare. The allusion is probably to Job's physical sufferings, which included severe pains in the lumbar region. He poureth out my gall upon the ground. The rupture of the gallbladder causes the contents to be sprit upon the ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He breaketh me with breach upon breach. As an enemy, when he besieges a town, crushes its resistance by means of \"breach upon breach.\" so is Job crushed by one attack after another. He runneth upon me like a giant; i.e. with overwhelming force - a force that is quite irresistible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin. Another transition. Job turns to the consideration of how he has acted under his severe afflictions. In the first place, he has put on sackcloth, not for a time merely, as ordinary mourners do, but for a permanency, so that he may be said to have sewn it to his skin. There is, perhaps, also an allusion to the adhesion of the garment to his many sores. And have defiled my horn in the dust. \"My horn\" is equivalent to \"my pride,\" \"my dignity.\" Job, when he left his state, and put on sackcloth, and \"sat down among the ashes\" (Job 2:8), denuded himself of his honour and dignity, and as it were trailed them in the dustNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - My face is foul with weeping He has wept so much that his face is stained with his tears. And on my eyelids is the shadow of death. There is an awful shadow on his eyes and eyelids, portending deathNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Not for any injustice in mine hands; or, not that there is any violence in my hands (scrap. Isaiah 53:9, where the expression used of the Messiah is nearly the same). Job repudiates the charge of rapine and robbery which Eliphaz has brought against him (Job 15:28, 34). His hands have not done violence to any. Also my prayer is pure. Neither has he been guilty of the hypocrisy which Eliphaz has also charged him with (Job 15:34). His prayers have been sincere and genuine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - O earth, cover not thou my blood! There was a widespread belief in the ancient world that innocent blood, spilt upon the ground, cried to God for vengeance, and remained a dark blot upon the earth till it was avenged, or until it was covered up. Job apostrophizes the earth, and be-seethes it not to cover up his blood when he dies, as he expects to do, shortly. And let my cry have no place; i.e. let it have no hiding-place, but fill earth and heaven. Let it continue to be heard until it is answered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Also now, behold, my Witness is in heaven; rather, even now (see the Revised Version). Job claims God for his Witness, looks to him for an ultimate vindication of his character, is sure that in one way or another he will make his righteousness clear as the noonday in the sight of men and angels (see Job 19:25-27, of which this is in some sort an anticipation). My record - or, he that vouches for me (Revised Version) - is on high - one of the so frequent pleonastic repetitions of one and the same idea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - My friends scorn me; literally, my scorners are my companions; i.e. I have to live with those who scorn me (comp. ch. 30:1-13). But mine eye poureth out tears unto God. It is not to his \"friends\" or \"companions,\" or \"comforters,\" or any human aid, that Job turns in his distress. God alone is his Refuge. Forced by his woes to pass his time in weeping and mourning (see ver. 16), it is to God that his heart turns, to God that he \"pours out his tears.\" Hardly as he thinks God to have used him, bitterly as he sometimes ventures to complain, yet the idea never crosses him of looking for help or sympathy to any other quarter, of having recourse to any other support or stay. \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him\" (Job 13:15), expresses the deepest feeling of his heart, the firmost principle of his nature. Nothing overrides it. Even \"out of the depths\" his soul cries to the Lord (see Psalm 130:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Oh that one might plead for a man with God! The original here is obscure. It may mean, Oh that he (i.e. God himself) would plead for a man with God! i.e. would become a Mediator between himself and man, plead for him, undertake his defence, and obtain for him merciful consideration. Or, nearly as in the Authorized Version, Oh that one might plead for man (i.e. mankind at large) with God! interest him on their behalf, and obtain a merciful judgment for them. The former rendering is to be preferred. As a man pleadeth for his neighbour; literally, as a son of man (or, as the Son of man) pleadeth for his neighbour. If we take the simpler rendering, \"as a son of man,\" then the meaning is simply, \"Oh that God would plead for man with himself, as a man is wont to plead for his fellow-man!\" But if we prefer the other rendering, \"as the Son of man,\" a Messianic interpretation will be necessary. (So Professor Lee and Dr. Stanley Leathes) But Messianic interpretations of passages that do not require them, and that have no such traditional interpretation, require extreme caution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - When a few years are come; literally, a number of years, which generally means a small number. I shall go the way whence I shall not return. This verse would more fitly begin the following chapter, which opens in a similar strain, with an anticipation of the near approach of deathNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-16. - The general character of this chapter has been considered in the introductory section to ch. 16. It is occupied mainly with Job's complaints of his treatment by his friends, and his lamentations over his sufferings (vers. 1-12). At the end he appeals to the grave, as the only hope or comfort left to him (vers. 13-16). Verse 1. - My breath is corrupt; or, my spirit is oppressed. But the physical meaning is the more probable one. A fetid breath is one of the surest signs of approaching dissolution. My days are extinct; or, cut off. The verb used does not occur elsewhere. The graves are ready for me; or, the chambers of the grave are mine already. The plural form is best explained by regarding it as referring to the niches commonly cut in a sepulchral chamber to receive the bodies of the departed (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. pp. 1528-1536).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Are there not mockers with me? literally, mockeries - the abstract for the concrete. (For the sentiment, comp. Job 16:20 and Job 30:1-14.) And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? i.e. \"Have I anything else to look upon? Are not the mockers always about me, always provoking me?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Lay down now; or, give now a pledge (see the Revised Version). The terms used in this verse are law terms. Job calls upon God to go into court with him, and, first of all, to deposit the caution-money which the court will require before it undertakes the investigation of the case. Next, he goes on to say, put me in a surety with thee; or rather (as in the Revised Version), be surety for me with thyself which is either the same thing with giving a pledge, or a further legal requirement. Finally, he asks the question, Who is he that will strike hands with me? meaning, \"Who else is there but thyself, to whom I can look to be my surety, and by striking hands (comp. Proverbs 6:1) with me to accept the legal responsibility?\" As Dr. Stanley Leathes says, \"It is wonderful the way in which the language of Job fits in with what we have since and elsewhere learnt concerning the Persons in the Godhead.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For thou hast hid their heart from understanding. My so-called friends will certainly not undertake for me, since thou hast blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts against me. Therefore shalt thou not exalt them. God will not exalt those who are without understanding.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He that speaketh flattery to his friends; rather, he that denounceth his friends for a prey. Job means to accuse his \"comforters\" of so acting. By their persistent belief in his grievous wickedness they give him up, as it were, for a prey to calamity, which they pronounce him to have deserved on account of his secret sins. Even the eyes of his children shall fail. Whoever so acts shall be punished, not only in his own person, but also in the persons of his descendants (comp. Exodus 20:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He hath made me also a byword of the people. God, by the unprecedented character of his afflictions, has made Job a byword among the surrounding nations - a byword, that is, for an afflicted person. Job, by the manner in which he bore his afflictions, made himself a byword for patience and endurance among God's people throughout all ages (see James 5:11). And aforetime I was as a tabret; rather, I am become an abomination before them; or, as our Revisers translate, 1 am become an open abhorring (comp. Job 30:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow (comp. Psalm 6:7; Psalm 31:9). Excessive weeping, such as stains the cheeks (Job 16:16), will also in most cases dim and dull the eyesight. And all my members are as a shadow. Weak, that is, worn out, unstable, fleeting, ready to pass away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Upright men shall be astonied at this. When Job's case comes to beknown, \"upright men\" will be astonished at it. They will marvel how it came to pass that such a man - so true, so faithful, so \"perfect\" (Job 1:1) - could have been allowed by God to suffer so terribly. In a world where, up to Job's time, prosperity had been taken as the measure of goodness, the marvel was naturally great. Even now many a Christian is surprised and disturbed in mind if he gives the case prolonged and serious attention, though he holds the clue to it in that most enlightening phrase, \"perfect through sufferings\" (Hebrews 2:10). And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. On astonishment will follow indignation. When it becomes generally recognized that, in a vast number of cases, the righteous suffer, while the wicked enjoy great prosperity, good men's feelings will be stirred up against these prosperous ones; they will wax indignant, and take part against them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The righteous also; rather, yet the righteous. A strong opposing clause. Notwithstanding all the afflictions that befall him, and all the further afflictions which he anticipates, yet the truly righteous man shall hold on his way; i.e. maintain his righteous course, neither deviating from it to the right hand nor to the left, but holding to the strict line of rectitude without. wavering. Job is not thinking particularly of himself, but bent on testifying that righteous men generally act as they do, not from any hope of reward, but from principle and the bent of their characters. And he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. Not only will the just man maintain his integrity, but, as time goes on, his goodness will be more and more firmly established (comp. Aristotle's 'Theory of Habits').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But as for you all, do ye return, and come now. A challenge to his detractors. Return, all of you, to your old work of detraction, if you so please. I care not. Your accusations no longer vex me. For I cannot find one wise man among you. If I could the case would be different. But, as you have all shown yourselves wholly devoid of wisdom (comp. Job 42:8), what you say has no real importance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My days are past. My days are slipping away from me. Life is well-nigh over. What, then, does it matter what you say? My purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart; literally, the possessions of my heart all the store that it has accumulated - my desires, purposes, wishes. I no longer care to vindicate my innocence in the sight of men, or to clear my character from aspersions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They change the night into day. They, my detractors, who are also my so-called \"comforters,\" pretend to change my night into day; assure me that the cloud which rests on me is only for a time, and will ere long give place to the brightness of day, to a glorious burst of sunshine (see Job 5:18-26; Job 8:21, 22; Job 11:15-19). The light (they say) is short because of darkness; or, rather, is near because of the darkness. To extreme darkness shows that dawn must be near, that the day must soon break when my sorrow will be turned into joy. Job had not found himself comforted by these assurances, which lacked the ring of sincerity, and could not be accomplished except by miracle, which he did not feel that he had any right to expect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If I wait, the grave is mine house; rather, surely I look for the grave (Sheol) as my house; i.e. I expect no return of prosperity, no renewal of life in a sumptuous mansion, no recovery of the state and dignity from which I have fallen - I look only for Sheol as my future abode and resting-place -there, in Sheol, I have made my bed in the darkness; i.e. I regard myself as already there, lying on my narrow bed in the darkness, at rest after my afflictions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; i.e. I do not murmur; I accept my lot; I am ready to lie down with corruption, and embrace it, and call it \"my father,\" and henceforth remain with it. The idea that the soul is still with the body in the grave, more or less closely attached to it, and sensible of its condition and changes, was widely prevalent in the ancient world. Where bodies were simply buried, the horrible imagination of a close association with corruption naturally and almost necessarily intruded itself, and led to such reflections as those of Job in this verse. It was partly to get rid of this terrible nightmare that the Egyptians were so careful to embalm the bodies of their dead, and that the Babylonians deposited them in baked clay coffins, which they filled with honey (Herod., 1:198); while others still more effectually prevented the process of corruption by cremation. The modern revival of cremation is remarkable as indicating a peculiar form of atavism or recurrence to ancient types. For many ages after the coming of Christ, men so separated between the soul and the body after death that the corruption of the grave had no horror for them. Now materialistic ideas have so far recurred, that many of those who believe the soul to live on after death are doubtful whether it may not still be attached to the body more or less, end, dreading contact with the corruption, of the latter, fall back upon the old remedy. To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. An expansion of the idea contained in the previous clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And where is now my hope? (comp. Job 14:18-15). At first sight it might seem that to cue in Sheol there could be no hope. But Job is too conscious of his own ignorance to dogmatize on such a subject. What does he know of Sheol? How can he be sure that it is \"God's last word to men\"? There may be As for my hope, who shall see it? i.e. what eye can penetrate the darkness of the future, and solve the riddle for me?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. There is great difficulty in determining the subject to the verb \"go down,\" which is the third person plural feminine, whereas the only plural substantive at all near - the word translated \"bars\" - is masculine. Some suppose Job's hopes to be meant, \"hope\" in the preceding verse having the force of any number of \"hopes\" (so the R.V.) Others disregard the grammatical difficulty of the plural feminine verb, and, making \"bars\" the nominative, translate, \"The bars of Sheol shall go down,\" i.e. \"be broken down, perish;\" or interrogatively, \"Shall the bars of Sheol go down?\" This rendering is thought to be \"in harmony with the whole undercurrent of thought in the chapter;\" but it has not approved itself to many commentators. The present commentator must acknowledge that he is unable to attach any satisfactory meaning to the words of the Hebrew text.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-21. - Bildad's second speech is no improvement upon his first (ch. 8.). He has evidently been exceedingly nettled by Job's contemptuous words concerning his \"comforters\" (Job 16:2, 11; Job 17:10); and aims at nothing but venting his anger, and terrifying Job by a series of denunciations and threats. Job has become to him \"the wicked man\" (vers. 5, 21), an embodiment of all that is evil, and one \"that knoweth not God.\" No punishment is too severe for him. Verses 1, 2. - Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? (So Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Welte, Merx, Lee, and Canon Cook.) Others render, \"How long will ye lay snares for words?\" which is a possible translation, but does not give a very good sense. Bildad, a tolerably concise speaker himself (see Job 8:2-22; Job 25:2-6), is impatient at the length of Job's replies. He had already, in his former speech (Job 8:2), reproached Job with his prolixity; now he repeats the charge. The employment of the second person plural in this and the following verses is not very easily accounted for. Bildad can scarcely mean to blame his friend Eliphaz. Perhaps he regards Job as having supporters among the lookers-on, of whom there may have been several besides Elihu (Job 32:2). Mark; rather, consider; i.e. think a little, instead of talking. And afterwards we will speak. Then, calmly and without hurry, we will proceed to reply to what you have said.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Wherefore are we counted as beasts? The allusion is probably to Job 16:10, where Job spoke of his \"comforters\" as \"gaping upon him with their mouths.\" And reputed vile in your sight! or, reckoned unclean. Job had spoken of his \"miserable comforters\" as \"ungodly and wicked\" (Job 16:11), without wisdom (Job 17:10) and without understanding (Job 17:4). But he had not said that they were \"unclean.\" Bildad, therefore, misrepresents him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He teareth himself in his anger. The Hebrew idiom, which allows of rapid transitions from the second to the third person, and vice versa, cannot be transferred without harshness to our modern speech. Our Revisers have given the true force of the original by discarding the third person, and translating, \"Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger.\" There is probably an allusion to Job 16:9, where Job had represented God as \"tearing him in his wrath.\" Bildad says it is not God who tests him - he tears himself. Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? i.e. \"Shall the course of the world be altered to meet thy wishes, to suit thy case?\" Job had wished for all manner of impossible things (Job 3:3-6; Job 9:32-35; Job 13:21, 22; Job 16:21; Job 17:3). Bildad's reproach is thus not wholly unjust. But he makes no allowance for the wild utter-shoes of one who is half distraught. And shall the rock be removed out of his place? Shall that which is most solid and firm give way, and alter its nature?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-21. - Bildad, from this point, turns wholly to denunciation. He strings together a long series of menaces - probably ancient saws, drawn from \"the wisdom of the Beni Kedem\" (1 Kings 4:30), and descriptive of the wretched fate of the wicked man, with whom he identifies Job. Verse 5. - Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out. Whatever the wicked man may at any time have acquired of splendour, glory, honour, wealth, or prosperity, shall be taken from him, and as it were extinguished. And the spark of his fire shall not shine. Not a single trace of his splendour, not a spark, not a glimmer, shall remain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The light shall be dark in his tabernacle. This is not, as Rosenmuller asserts, a mere repetition of the thought contained in the preceding verse with a change of terms, and a variation of metaphor. It is a denunciation of woe to the whole house of the ungodly man, not to himself only. As Schultens says, \"Lumen ob-tenebratum in tentorio est fortuna domus extincta.\" And his candle shall be put out with him; rather, as in the Revised Version, his!amp above him shall be put out; i.e. the lamp which swings above him in his tent, or in his chamber, shall be extinguished. Darkness shall fall upon the whole house of the wicked man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The steps of his strength shall he straitened. In the time of his prosperity the wicked man had a wide sphere within which to exercise his activity, and strode hither and thither at his pleasure. When punishment falls on him, his \"steps will be straitened,\" i.e. his sphere narrowed, his activity cramped, his powers \"cabined, cribbed, confined.\" And his own counsel shall cast him down (see Job 5:13; and comp. Psalm 7:14,-16; 9:16; 10:2; Hosea 10:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For he is cast into a net by his own feet. He walks of his own accord into a snare, not necessarily into one that he has himself set for others, as in Psalm 7:15; Psalm 9:15; Psalm 35:8; Psalm 57:6; and Proverbs 26:27; but either into one of his own setting, or into one laid for him by others (see ver. 10). And he walketh upon a snare. A mere repetition of the idea expressed in the preceding hemistich.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber (rather, the man-trap) shall prevail against him. Fifty years ago man-traps were commonly set at night in gardens and orchards in this country, which held intending thieves until the proprietor came and took them before a magistrate in the morning. (On the employment of such traps in antiquity, see Herod., 2:121. § 2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way; or, the noose is hid for him in the ground (see the Revised Version). Six different kinds of traps or snares are mentioned, \"the speaker heaping together every word that he can find descriptive of the art of snaring.\" The art had been well studied by the Egyptians long before the age of Job, and a great variety of contrivances for capturing both beasts and birds are represented on the very early monuments (Wilkinson, in the authors' Herodotus,' vol. it. pp. 77, 78). We may conclude from this passage that it had also been brought to an advanced stage of excellence in Syria and Arabia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTerrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Terrors shall make him afraid on every side. Vague fears, panic terrors, no longer subjective, but to his bewildered brain objective, shall seem to menace the wicked man on every side, and shall affright him continually. There is an allusion, doubtless, to what Job has said of the gloomy and terrifying thoughts which come over him from time to time (Job 3:25; Job 7:14; Job 9:28; Job 13:21) and fill him with consternation. And shall drive him to his feet; rather, shall chase him at his heels (see the Revised Version). Like a pack of hounds, or wolves, or jackals. Jackals are common in Palestine and the adjacent countries. They hunt in lacks, and generally run down their prey; but do not, unless hard pressed by hunger, attack men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - His strength shall be hunger-bitten. (So Dillmann, Cook, and the Revised Version.) To the other sufferings of the wicked man shall be added the pangs of hunger. His bodily strength shall disappear, as destitution and famine come upon him. And destruction shall be ready at his side. Ready to seize on him at any moment. Some translate, \"ready for his halting\" i.e. ready to seize on him in ease of his tripping or halting (so the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - It shall devour the strength of his skin; literally, the bars of his skin by which some understand \"the muscles,\" some \"the members,\" of his body. The general meaning is plain, that destruction shall always be close to him, and shall ultimately make him its own. Even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. By \"the firstborn of death\" is probably intended, either some wasting disease generally, or perhaps the special disease from which Job is suffering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle; rather, he shall be rooted out of his tabernacle (or, tent), which is his confidence, or wherein he trusteth; i.e. he shall be torn from the home, where he thought himself secure as in a stronghold. And it shall bring him; rather, one shall bring him or, he shall be brought. To the king of terrors. Probably death, rather than Satan, is intended. None of Job's \"comforters\" seems to have had any conception of Satan as a personal being, nor even Job himself. It is only the author. or arranger, of the book who recognizes the personality and power of the prince of darkness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his; either, it (i.e. terror) shall dwell in his tabernacle which is no longer his; or, they shall dwell in his tabernacle that are none of his; i.e. strangers st, all inhabit the place where he dwelt heretofore (compare the Revised Version). Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. As God rained fire and brimstone out of heaven upon the cities of the plain (Genesis 19:24), so shall brimstone be scattered upon his habitation to ruin and destroy it (comp. Deuteronomy 29:23; Psalm 11:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - His roots shall be dried up beneath. He shall be like a tree whose roots no moisture reaches, and which, therefore, withers and dries up (comp. Job 14:8, 9; Job 29:19). And above shall his branch be cut off; or, be withered (comp. Job 14:2, where the same verb is used).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - His remembrance shall perish from the earth (comp. Psalm 34:16; Psalm 109:13). This is always spoken of in Scripture as a great calamity, one of the greatest that can befall a man. It was felt as such, not only by the Jews, but by the Semitic people generally, whose earnest desire to perpetuate their memory is shown by the elaborate monuments and lengthy inscriptions which they set up in so many places. Arabian poetry, no less than Jewish, is penetrated by the idea. In one point of view it may seem a vulgar ambition; but, in another, it is a pathetic craving alter that continuance which the spirit of man naturally desires, but of which it has, apart from revelation, no assurance. And he shall have no name in the street; or, in the world without (comp. Job 5:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world (comp. Job 10:21, 22; Job 17:16). What Job represents as a welcome retreat, whither he would gladly withdraw himself, Bildad depicts as a banishment, into which he will be driven on account of his sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people; rather, nor grandson; i.e. \"his posterity shall be clean put out\" (Psalm 109:14). Nor any remaining in his dwellings; rather, in the places where he sojourned (compare the Revised Version, which gives \"in his sojournings\"). It is implied that the wicked man shall be a vagabond, without a home, sojourning now here, now there, for a short time. Neither among his own people, nor in these places of his temporary abode, shall he leave any descendant. Bildad probably intends to glance at the destruction of Job's children (Job 1:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They that come after him shall be astonied at his day; i.e. \"at the time of his visitation\" (comp. Psalm 37:13, \"The Lord shall laugh at him, for he seeth that his day is coming;\" and Psalm 137:7, \"Remember the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,\" i.e. the day of its overthrow). As they that went before were affrighted. His fate shall alarm equally his contemporaries and his successors, at possibly \"the dwellers in the West and the dwellers in the East\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked. \"Such as I have described is the general condition and manner of life of the man who is wicked.\" and this is the place (or, position) of him that knoweth not God. The singular number used both in this clause and the preceding indicates that the whole series of denunciations (vers. 5-21) is levelled against an individual - viz. Job.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-29. - Job begins his answer to Bildad's second speech by an expostulation against the unkindness of his friends, who break him in pieces, and torture him, with their reproaches (vers. 1-5). He then once more, and more plainly than on any other occasion, recounts his woes.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) His severe treatment by God (vers. 6-13);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) his harsh usage by his relatives and friends (vers. 14-19): andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the pain caused him by his disease (ver. 20); and appeals to his friends on these grounds for pity and forbearance (vers. 21, 22). Next, he proceeds to make his great avowal, prefacing it with a wish for its preservation as a perpetual record (vers. 23, 24); the avowal itself follows (vers. 25-27); and the speech terminates with a warning to his \"comforters,\" that if they continue to persecute him, a judgment will fall upon them (vers. 28, 29). Verses 1, 2. - Then Job answered and said, How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? Job is no Stoic. He is not insensible to his friends' attacks. On the contrary, their words sting him, torture him, \"break him in pieces,\" wound his soul in its tenderest part. Bildad's attack had been the cruellest of all, and it drives him to expostulation (vers. 2-5) and entreaty (vers. 21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - These ten times have ye reproached me. (For the use of the expression \"ten times\" for \"many times.\" \"frequently.\" see Genesis 31:7, 41; Numbers 14:22; Nehemiah 4:12; Daniel 1:20, etc.) Ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me; rather, that ye deal hardly with me (see the Revised Version). The verb used does not occur elsewhere, but seems to have the meaning of \"ill use\" or \"ill treat\" (see Professor Lee's \"Commentary on the Book of Job\" p. 328).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And be it indeed that I have erred; or, done wrong. Job at no time maintains his impeccability. Sins of infirmity he frequently pleads guilty to, and specially to intemperate speech (see Job 6:26; Job 9:14, 20, etc.). Mine error remaineth with myself; i.e. \"it remains mine; and I suffer the punishment.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me. If you have no sense of justice, and are disinclined to pay any heed to my expostulations; if you intend still to insist on magnifying yourselves against me, and bringing up against me my \"reproach;\" then let me make appeal to your pity. Consider my whole condition - how I stand with God, who persecutes me and \"destroys\" me (ver. 10); how I stand with my relatives and such other friends as I have beside yourselves, who disclaim and forsake me (vers. 13-19); and how I am conditioned with respect to my body, emaciated and on the verge of death (ver. 20); and then, if neither your friendship nor your sense of justice will induce you to abstain from persecuting me, abstain at any rate for pity's sake (ver. 21). And plead against me my reproach. Job's special \"reproach\" was that God had laid his hand upon him. This was a manifest fact, and could not be denied. His \"comforters\" concluded from it that he was a monster of wickedness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Know now that God hath overthrown me; or, perverted me - \"subverted me in my cause\" (see Lamentations 3:6). And hath compassed me with his net. Professor Lee thinks that the net, or rather noose, intended by the rare word מצוּד is the lasso' which was certainly employed in war (Herod., 7:85), and probably also in hunting, from ancient times in the East. Bildad had insinuated that Job had fallen into his own snare (Job 18:7-9); Job replies that the snare in which he is taken is from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Behold, I cry out of wrong; i.e. \"I cry out that I am wronged.\" I complain that sufferings are inflicted on me that I have not deserved. This has been Job's complaint from the first (Job 3:26; Job 6:29; Job 9:17, 22; Job 10:3, etc.). But I am not heard; i.e. \"I am not listened to - my cry is not answered.\" I cry aloud, but there is no judgment; or, no decision- \"no sentence.\" All Job's appeals to God have elicited no reply from him. He still keeps silence. Job appears from the first to have anticipated such a theophany as ultimately takes place (ch. 38-41.) and vindicates his character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass (comp. Job 3:25; Job 13:27; Hosea 2:6), and he hath set darkness in my paths. Job complains of the want of light; in his heart he cries, Ἐν δὲ φάει καὶ ὄλεσσον. Nothing vexes him so much as his inability to understand why he is afflicted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He hath stripped me of my glory. The glory which he had in his prosperity; not exactly that of a king, but that of a great sheikh or emir - of one who was on a par with the noblest of those about him (see Job 1:3). And taken the crown from my head. Not an actual crown, which sheikhs do not wear, but a metaphor for dignity or honour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone; or, broken me down. Job compares himself to a city, the walls of which are attacked on every side and broken down. His ruin is complete - he perishes. And mine hope hath he removed like a tree; rather, torn up like a tree. Job's \"hope\" was, no doubt, to lead a tranquil and a godly life, surrounded by his relatives and friends, in favour with God and man, till old age came, and he descended, like a ripe shock of corn (Job 5:26), to the grave. This hope had been \"torn up by the roots\" when his calamities fell upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He hath also kindled his wrath against me. It is not what has happened to him in the way of affliction and calamity that so much oppresses and crushes the patriarch, as the cause to which he, not unnaturally, ascribes his afflictions, vie. the wrath of God. Participating in the general creed of his time, he believes his sufferings to come direct from God, and to be proofs of God's severe anger against him. He is not, however, prepared on this account to renounce God. \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him\" (Job 13:15) is still his inward sustaining thought and guiding principle. And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. Job felt himself treated as an enemy of God, and supposed that God must consider him such. He either had no glimpse of the cheering truth, \"Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth\" (Hebrews 12:6), or he could not imagine that such woes as his were mere chastenings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - His troops come together (comp. Job 16:13, \"His archers compass me round about\"). It seems to Job that God brings against him a whole army of assailants, who join their forces together and proceed to the attack. Clouds of archers, troops of ravagers, come about him, and fall upon him from every side. And raise up their way against me; rather, and cast up their bank against me. Job still regards himself as a besieged city (see ver. 10), and represents his assailants as raising embankments to hem him in, or mounds from which to batter his defences (compare the Assyrian sculptures, passim). And encamp round about my tabernacle; i.e. \"my tent,\" or \"my dwelling.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He hath put my brethren far from me. Job had actual \"brothers\" (Job 42:11), who forsook him and \"dealt deceitfully\" with him (Job 6:15) during the time of his adversity, but were glad enough to return to him and \"eat bread with him\" in his later prosperous life. Their alienation from him during the period of his afflictions he here regards as among the trials laid upon him by God. Compare the similar woe of Job's great Antitype (John 5:5, \"For neither did his brethren believe on him\"). And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me (comp. Psalm 38:11; Psalm 69:9; Psalm 88:8, 18). The desertion of the afflicted by their fair-weather friends is a standing topic with the poets and moralists of all ages and nations. Job was not singular in this affliction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me (see Psalm 41:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger.

Astounding insolence in an Oriental servant or rather slave (עבד), who should have hung upon his master's words, and striven to anticipate his wishes. I intreated him with my mouth. Begging him probably for some service which was distasteful, and which he declined to render.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - My breath is strange to my wife. The breath of a sufferer from elephantiasis has often a fetid odour which is extremely disagreeable. Job's wife, it would seem, held aloof from him on this account, so that he lost the tender offices which a wife is the fittest person to render. Though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. This translation is scarcely tenable, though no doubt it gives to the words used a most touching and pathetic sense. Translate, and I am loathsome to the children of my mother's wench; i.e. to my brothers and sisters (comp. Job 42:11). It would seem that they also avoided Job's presence, or at any rate any near approach to him. Under the circumstances, this is perhaps not surprising; but Job, in his extreme isolation, felt it keenly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Yea, young children despised me. (So Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version.) Others translate, \"the vile,\" or \"the perverse\" (comp. Job 16:11). But the rendering of the Authorized Version receives support from Job 21:11. The forwardness of rude and ill-trained children to take part against God's saints appears later in the history of Elisha (2 Kings 2:23, 24). I arose, and they spake against me; or, when I arise they speak against me (compare. the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - All my inward friends abhorred me; literally, all the men of my counsel; i.e. all those whom I was accustomed to consult, and whose advice I was wont to take, in any difficulty, by keeping aloof, have shown their abhorrence of me. And they whom I loved are turned against me (comp. Psalm 41:9; Psalm 55:12-14: Jeremiah 20:10). The saints of God in all ages, and however differently circumstanced, are assailed by almost the same trials and temptations. Whether it be Job, or David, or Jeremiah, or One greater than any of them, the desertion and unkindness of their nearest and dearest, as the bitterest of all sufferings, is almost sure to be included in their cup, which they must drink to the dregs, if they are to experience to the full \"the precious uses of adversity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh. Here the third source of Job's misery is brought forward - his painful and incurable disease. This has brought him to such a pitch of emaciation that his bones seem to adhere to the tightened skin, and the scanty and shrunken muscles, that cover them (comp. Job 33:21 and Lamentations 4:8). Such emaciation of the general frame is quite compatible with the unsightly swelling of certain parts of the body which characterizes elephantiasis. And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. The expression is, no doubt, proverbial, and signifies \"barely escaped;\" but its origin is obscure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends. On the enumeration of his various woes, Job's appeal for pity follows. We must not regard it as addressed merely to the three so-called \"friends\" (Job 2:11) or \"comforters\" (Job 16:2), Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. It is an appeal to all those who are around him and about him, whose sympathies have been bither to estranged (vers. 13-19), but whose regard he does not despair of winning back. Will they not, when they perceive the extremity and variety of his sufferings, be moved to compassion by them, and commiserate him in his day of calamity? For the hand of God hath touched me. To the \"comforters\" this is no argument. They deem him unworthy of pity on the very ground that he is \"smitten of God, and afflicted\" (Isaiah 53:4); since they hold that, being so smitten, he must have' deserved his calamity. But to unprejudiced persons, not wedded to a theory, such an aggravation of his woe would naturally seem to render him a greater object of pity and compassion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Why do ye persecute me as God? i.e. Why are ye as hard on me as God himself? If I have offended him, what have I done to offend you? And are not satisfied with my flesh? i.e. \"devour my flesh, like wild beasts, and yet are not satisfied.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Oh that my words were written! It is questioned what words of his Job is so anxious to have committed to writing - those that precede the expression of the wish, or those that follow, or both. As there is nothing that is very remarkable in the preceding words, whereas the latter are among the most striking in the book, the general opinion has been that he refers to these last. It is now universally allowed, even by those whose date for Job is the most remote, that books were common long before his time, and so that he might naturally have been familiar with them. Writing is, of course, even anterior to books, and was certainly in use before B.C. 2000. The earliest writing was probably on stone or brick, and was perhaps in every case hieroglyphical. When writing on papyrus, or parchment, or the bark of trees, came into use, a cursive character soon superseded the hieroglyphical, though the latter continued In be employed for religious purposes, and for inscriptions on stone. Oh that they were printed in a book! rather, inscribed, or engraved. The impression of the characters below the surface of the writing material, as in the Babylonian and Assyrian clay-tablets, seems to be pointed at.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! A peculiar kind of rock-inscription, of which, so far as I know, no specimens remain, appears to be here alluded to. Job wished the characters of his record to be cut deep into the rock with an iron chisel, and the incision made to be then filled up with lead (compare the mediaeval \"brasses\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For I know that my Redeemer liveth. Numerous endeavours have been made to explain away the mysterious import of this verse. First, it is noted that a goel is any one who avenges or ransoms another, and especially that it is \"the technical expression for the avenger of blood\" (Froude, 'Short Stories,' vol. 1. p. 284) so often mentioned in the Old Testament. It is suggested, therefore, that Job's real meaning may be that he expects one of his relatives to arise after his death as the avenger of his blood, and to exact retribution for it. But unless in the case of a violent death at the hands of a man, which was not what Job expected for himself, there could be no avenger of blood. Job has already expressed his desire to have a thirdsman between him and God (Job 9:32-35), which thirdsman can scarcely be other than a Divine Personage. In Job 16:19 be has declared his conviction that\" his Witness is in heaven.\" In ver. 21 of the same chapter he longs to have an advocate to plead his cause with God. In Job 17:3 he calls upon God to be Surety for him. Therefore, as Dr. Stanley Leathes points out, \"he has already recognized God as his Judge his Umpire his Advocate his Witness and his Surety in some cases by formal confession of the fact, in others by earnest longing after, and aspiration for, some one to act in that capacity.\" After all this, it is not taking a very long step in advance to see and acknowledge in God his Goel, or \"Redeemer.\" And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; rather, and that at the last he shall stand up over my dust. אַחַדון is not \"one who comes after me;\" but, if a noun, \"the last one\" as רִאשׁון is \"the first one \"(Isaiah 44:6); if intended adverbially, \"at the last\" - i.e, at the end of all things. \"At the latter day\" is not an improper translation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And though after my skin worms destroy this body. The supposed ellipsis of \"worms\" is improbable, as is also that of \"body.\" Translate, and after my skin has been thus destroyed - \"thus\" meaning, \"as you see it before your eyes.\" Yet in my flesh shall I see God; literally, from my flesh - scarcely, as Renan takes it, \"without my flesh,\" or \"away from my flesh\" - \"prive de ma chair;\" but rather, \"from the standpoint of my flesh \" - \"in my body,\" not \"out of my body\" - shall I see God. This may be taken merely as a prophecy of the theophany recorded in ch. 38-42. (see especially Job 42:5). But the nexus with ver. 25, and the expressions there used - \"at the last,\" and \"he shall stand up over my dust\" - fully justify the traditional exegesis, which sees in the passage an avowal by Job of his confidence that he will see God \"from his body\" at the resurrection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Whom I shall see for myself. Not by proxy, i.e. or through faith, or in a vision, but really, actually, I shall see him for myself. As Schultens observes, an unmistakable tone of exultation and triumph pervades the passage. And mine eyes shall behold, and not another; i.e. \"not the eyes of another.\" I myself, retaining my personal identity, \"the same true living man,\" shall with my own eyes look on my Redeemer. Though my reins be consumed within me. There is no \"though \"in the original. The clause is detached and independent, nor is it very easy to trace any connection between it and the rest of the verse. Schultens, however, thinks Job to mean that he is internally consumed by a burning desire to see the sight of which he has spoken. (So also Dr. Stanley Leathes.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - But ye should say, Why persecute we him? rather, if ye shall say How shall we persecute him? That is to say, \"If, after what I have said, ye continue bitter against me, and take counsel together as to the best way of persecuting me, then, seeing the root of the matter (i.e. the essence of piety) is found in me, be ye afraid,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob19:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Be ye afraid of the sword; i.e. \"the sword of God's justice, which will assuredly smite you if you persecute an innocent man.\" For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword; rather, for wrath is among the transgressions of the sward; i e. among the transgressions for which the sword is the fit punishment. It is \"wrath\" which leads Job's \"comforters\" to Persecute him. That ye may know there is a judgment; or, so that ye will know there is a judgment When the blow comes upon them they will recognize that it has come upon them on account of their ill treatment of their friend.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - There was a man. This opening presents to us the Book of Job as a detached work, separate from and independent of all others. The historical books are generally united each to each by the you connective. In the land of Us. Uz, or Huz (Hebrew, עוּץ), seems to have been originally, like Judah, Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., the name of a man. It was borne by a son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham (Genesis 22:21), and again by a son of Dishan, the son of Seir the Horite (Genesis 36:28). Some regard it as also a personal name in Genesis 10:23. But from this use it passed to the descendants of one or more of these patriarchs, and from them to the country or countries which they inhabited. The \"land of Uz\" is spoken of, not only in this passage, but also in Jeremiah 25:20 and Lamentations 4:21. These last-cited places seem to show that Jeremiah's \"land of Uz\" was in or near Edom, and therefore south of Palestine; but as Uzzites, like so many nations of these ports, were migratory, we need not be surprised if the name Uz was, at different times, attached to various localities. Arabian tradition regards the region of the Hauran, north-east of Palestine, as Job's country. The other geographical names in the Book of Job point to a more eastern location, one not far remote from the southern Euphrates, and the adjacent parts of Arabia Sheba, Dedan, Teman, Buz, Shuah, and Chesed (Casdim) all point to this locality. On the other hand, there is a passage in the inscriptions of Asshur-banipal (circ. B.C. 650-625) which, associating together the names of Huz and Buz (Khazu and Bazu), appears to place them both in Central Arabia, not far from the Jebel Shnmmar ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 470). My own conclusion would be that, while the name \"land of Uz\" designated at various periods various localities, Job's \"land of Uz\" lay a little west of the Lower Euphrates, on the borders of Chaldea and Arabia. Whose name was Job. In the Hebrew the name is \"Iyyob,\" whence the \"Eyoub\" of the Arabs and the \"Hiob\" of the Germans. It is quite a distinct name from that of the third son of Issachar (Genesis 46:18), which is properly expressed by \"Job,\" being יוב. Iyyob is supposed to be derived from aib (אָיִב), \"to be hostile,\" and to mean \"cruelly or hostilely treated,\" in which ease we must suppose it to have been first given to the patriarch in his later life, and to have superseded some other, as \"Peter\" superseded \"Simon,\" and \"Paul\" superseded \"Saul.\" According to a Jewish tradition, adopted by some of the Christian Fathers, Job's original name was \"Jobab,\" and under this name he reigned as King of Edom (Genesis 36:33). But this kingship is scarcely compatible with the view given of him in the Book of Job. The supposed connection of the name of Juba with that of Job is very doubtful. And that man was perfect. Tam (תָּם), the word translated \"perfect,\" seems to mean \"complete, entire, not wanting in any respect,\" It corresponds to the Greek τέλειος, and the Latin integer (comp. Horace, 'Od.,' 1:22. 1, \"Integer vitro, scelerisque purus'). It does not mean\" absolutely sinless,\" which Job was not (comp. Job 9:20; Job 40:4). And upright. This is the exact meaning of yashar (יָשָׁר). \"The Book of Jasher\" was \"the Book of the Upright\" (βιβλίον τοῦ εὐθοῦς, 2 Samuel 1:18). One that feared God, and eschewed evil; literally, fearing God and departing from evil. The same testimony is given of Job by God himself in ver. 8, and again in Job 2:3 (comp. also Ezekiel 14:14, 20). We must suppose Job to have reached as near perfection as was possible tot man at the time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. The numbers three and seven, and their product, ten, are certainly sacred numbers, regarded as expressive of ideal perfection. But this does not prevent their being also historical. As Canon Cook observes, \"Striking coincidences between outward facts and ideal numbers are not uncommon in the purely historical portions of Scripture\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 20). There are twelve apostles, seventy (7 × 10) disciples sent out by our Lord, seven deacons, three synoptic Gospels, twelve minor prophets, seven princes of Persia and Media, ten sons of Haman, three of Noah, Gomer, Terah, Levi, and Zeruiah, seven of Japhet, Mizraim, Seir the Horite, Gad, and Jesse (1 Chronicles 2:13-15), twelve of Ishmael, twelve of Jacob, etc. Our Lord is thirty (3 x 10) years old when he begins to teach, and his ministry lasts three years; he heals seven lepers, casts out of Mary Magdalene seven devils, speaks upon the cross seven \"words,\" bids Peter forgive his brother \"seventy times seven,\" etc. It is thus not only in vision or in prophecy, or in symbolical language, that these \"ideal numbers\" come to the front far more frequently than ethers, but also in the most matter-of-fact histories.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - His substance also; literally, his acquisition (from קָנָה, acquirere), but used of wealth generally. Seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses. Note, first of all, the absence of horses or mules from this list - an indication of high antiquity. Horses were not known in Egypt till the time of the shepherd-kings (about B.C. 1900-1650), who introduced them from Asia. None are given to Abraham by the Pharaoh contemporary with him (Genesis 12:16). We hear of none as possessed by the patriarchs in Palestine; and, on the whole, it is not probable that they had been known in Western Asia very long before their introduction into Egypt. They are natives of Central Asia, where they are still found wild, and passed gradually by exportation to the more southern regions, Armenia, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Arabia. Note, secondly, that the items of Job's wealth accord with those of Abraham's (Genesis 12:16). Thirdly, note that Job's wealth in cattle is not beyond credibility. An Egyptian lord of the time of the fourth dynasty relates that he possessed above 1000 oxen and cows, 974 sheep, 2,235 goals, and 760 asses (Rawlinson's 'Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 88). Further, the proportion of the camels is noticeable, and implies a residence on the borders of the desert (see the comment on ver. 1). and a very great household; literally, and a very great service, or retinue of servants. Oriental emirs and sheikhs consider it necessary for their dignity to maintain a number of attendants and retainers (except, perhaps, in feudal times) quite unknown to the West. Abraham had three hundred and eighteen trained servants, born in his house (Genesis 14:14). Egyptian households were \"full of domestics,\" comprising attendants of all kinds - grooms, artisans, clerks, musicians, messengers, and the like. A sheikh, situated as Job was, would also require a certain number of guards, while for his cattle he would need a large body of shepherds, ox-herds, and the like (see Birch's 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 44). So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. The Beney Kedem, or \"men of the east,\" literally, sons of the east, seems to include the entire population between Palestine and the Euphrates (Genesis 29:1; Judges 6:3; Judges 7:12; Judges 8:10; Isaiah 11:14; Jeremiah 49:28, etc.). Many tribes of Arabs are similarly designated at the present day, e.g. the Beni Harb, the Beni Suhr, the Bani Naim, the Bani Lain, etc. It would seem that the Phoenicians must have called themselves Beni Kedem when they settled in Greece, since the Greeks knew them as \"Cadmeisns,\" and made them descendants of a mythic \"Cadreus' (Herod., 5:57-59). The name \"Saracens\" is to some extent analogous, since it means \"Men of the morning.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And his sons went and feasted. \"Went and feasted\" seems to mean \"were in the habit of feastlng\" (Rosenmuller, Lee). In their houses. Each had his own residence, and the residence was not a tent, but a\" house.\" Job and his sons were not mere nomads, but belonged to the settled population. The same is implied by the \"ploughing of the oxen\" (ver. 14), and indeed by Job's \"yoke of oxen\" in ver. 3. Every one his day. Most commentators regard these feasts as birthday festivities. Each son in his turn, when his birthday arrived, entertained his six brothers. Others think that each of the seven brothers had his own special day of the week on which, he received his brothers at his table, so that the feasting was continuous. But this scarcely suits the context. And it is admitted that \"his day\" (in Job 3:1) means \"his birthday.\" The celebration of birthdays by means of a feast was a very widespread custom in the East (see Genesis 40:20; Herod., 1:133; 9:110; Mark 14:21). And sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. This by itself is sufficient to show that the feasts were occasional, not continuous. Constant absence of daughters, day after day, from the parental board is inconceivable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about; rather, when the days of the feasting had come round; i.e. whenever one of the birthdays had arrived in due course, and the feasting had taken place. That Job sent and sanctified them. In the old world, outside the Mosaic Law, the father of the family was the priest, to whom alone it belonged to bless, purify, and offer sacrifice. Job, after each birthday-feast, sent, it would seem, for his sons, and purified them by the accustomed ablutions, or possibly by some other ceremonial process, regarding it as probable that, in the course of their feasting, they had contracted some defilement. It would seem by the next clause that the purification took place at the close of the day of festivity. And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings. Burnt offerings were instituted soon after the Fall, as we learn from Genesis 4:4, and were in common use long before the Mosaic Law was given (see Genesis 8:20; Genesis 22:8, 13; Genesis 31:54; Exodus 18:12; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 20, 21; vol. 12. pp. 49, 71, etc.). The practice was common, so far as appears, to all the nations of antiquity, except the Persians (Herod., 1:132). According to the number of them all One, apparently, for each child, since each might have sinned in the way suggested. The offerings were clearly it. tended as expiatory. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Two wholly different meanings are assigned by good Hebraists to the expression בר אחים. According to some, בר has its usual sense, \"to bless,\" and אלהים signifies \"false gods,\" or \"idols;\" according to the others, who form the great majority, אלהים has its usual sense of \"God,\" and בר has the unusual sense of \"curse\" (so Buxtorf, Rosenmuller, Schultens, (Cook, Stanley Leathes, among moderns, and among ancient authorities, the Septuagint and the Vulgate). How the same word comes to have the two wholly opposite senses of \"to bless\" and \"to curse\" has been differently explained. Some think that, as men blessed their friends both on receiving them and on bidding them adieu, the word בר got the sense of \"bidding adieu to,\" \"dismissing,\" \"renouncing.\" Others regard the use of בר for \"to curse\" as a mere euphemism, and compare the use of sacer and sacrari in Latin, and such expressions as \"Bless the stupid man!\" \"What a blessed nuisance!\" in English. The maledictory sense seems to be established by Job 2:9 and 1 Kings 21:10. By \"cursing God in their hearts\" Job probably means \"forgetting him,\" \"putting him out of sight,\" \"not giving him the honour which is his due.\" Thus did Job continually; literally, as in the margin, all the days; i.e. whenever one of the festival-days occurred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord. By \"the sons of God\" it is generally admitted that, in this place, the angels are meant (so again in Job 38:7). The meaning of the phrase is probably different in Genesis 6:2. Angels and men are alike \"sons of God,\" as created by him, in his image, to obey and serve him. Christ, the \"Only Begotten,\" is his Son in quite a different sense. We may gather, perhaps, from this place and Job 2:1 that there are fixed times at which the angelic host, often sent out by the Almighty on distant errands, has to gather together, one and all, before the great white throne, to pay homage to their Lord, and probably to give an account of their doings. And Satan came also among them. The word \"Satan\" has the article prefixed to it השׂתן here and elsewhere in Job, as in Zechariah 3:1, 2 and in Luke 22:31; Revelation 12:9. Thus accompanied, it is less a proper name than an appellative - \"the adversary\" (comp. 1 Peter 5:8; ὁ ἀντίδικος). In 1 Chronicles 21:1, without the article, it is undoubtedly a proper name, as in the New Testament, passim. Accusation of men before God is one of the special offices of the evil spirit (see Zechariah 3:1, 2), who is \"the accuser of the brethren, he that accuses them before God day and night\" (Revelation 12:10). The accusations that he makes may be either true or false, but they are so often false that his ordinary New Testament name is ὁ διάβολος, \"the Slanderer.\" The existence of an evil spirit must have been known to all who read or heard the story of the fall of man (Genesis 3.), and the descriptive epithet, \"the Adversary,\" is likely to have been in use from a very early date. The notion that the Satan of the Old Testament is a reflex of the Persian Ahriman, and that the Jews derived their belief upon the subject from the Persians, is quite untenable. The character and position of Satan in the Hebrew system are quite unlike those of Ahriman (Angro-mainyus) in the religion of the Zoroastrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 104-113).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? God condescends to address the evil spirit, and asks him questions - not that anything could be added to his own knowledge, but that the angels, who were present (ver. 6), might hear and have their attention called to the doings of Satan, which would need to be watched by them, and sometimes to be restrained or (it may be) prevented (comp. 1 Kings 22:20, where again the colloquy is opened by God asking a question). Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. Satan, therefore, is not himself, like the bulk of his evil angels, \"reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the last day\" (Jude 1:6). He searches the whole earth continually, never passing, never resting, but \"going about,\" as St. Peter says (1 Peter 5:8), \"like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,\" waiting till the coming of the \"thousand years,\" when an angel will \"bind him with a great chain, and cast him into the bottom-less pit\" (Revelation 20:1, 2). It will be a happy day for the earth when that time comes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered? literally. Hast thou set thine heart on? equivalent to \"Hast thou given thine attention to?\" (comp. Isaiah 41:22; Haggai 1:5, 7). My servant Job; i.e. \"my true servant, faithful in all that he does\" (comp. Hebrews 3:5). It is a high honour to any man for God to acknowledge him as his servant (see Joshua 1:2; 1 Kings 11:13, etc.). That there is none like him in the earth; rather, for there is none like him (see the Revised Version). This is given as a reason why Satan should have paid special attention to his case, and is a sort of challenge: \"Thou that art always spying out some defect or other in a righteous man, hast thou noted my servant Job, and discovered any fault in him?\" A perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil (see the comment on ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Satan insinuates that Job's motive is purely selfish. He serves God, not for love of God, or for love of goodness, but for what he gets by it. Satan is too shrewd to endeavour, as Job's friends do later, to pick holes in Job's conduct. No; that is exemplary. But the true character of acts is determined by the motive. What is Job's motive? Does he not serve God to gain his protection and blessing? Similarly, in modern times, ungodly men argue that religious and devout persons are religious and devout with a view to their own interest, because they expect to gain by it, either in this world, or in the next, or in both. This is a form of calumny which it is impossible to escape. And bad men, who are conscious to themselves of never acting except from a selfish motive, may well imagine the same of others. It is rarely that such an insinuation can be disproved. In the present instance God vindicates his servant, and covers the adversary with shame, as the other adversaries and calumniators of righteousness will be covered at the last day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hast not thou made an hedge about him? i.e. \"hedged him around, protected him, made a sort of invisible fence about him, through which no evil could creep.\" This was undoubtedly true. God had so protected him. But the question was not as to this fact, but as to Job's motive. Was it mere prudence? - the desire to secure a continuance of this protection? And about his house; i.e. \"his family\" - his sons and daughters - the members of his household. And about all that he hath on every side. His possessions - land, houses, cattle, live stock of all kinds, furniture, goods and chattels. Thou hast blessed the work of his hands (comp. Psalm 1:3, where it is said of the righteous man. that \"whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper\"). So it was with Job. God's blessing was upon him, and success crowned all his enterprises. \"The work of his hands\" will include everything that he attempted. And his substance is increased in the land. In the former clause we have the cause, God's blessing; in the latter the effect, a great increase in Job's \"substance,\" or \"cattle\" (marginal reading). (On the final number of his cattle, see ver. 3.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But put forth thine hand now; literally, send forth thy hand, as a man does who strikes a blow (comp. Genesis 22:12; Exodus 3:20; Exodus 9:15, etc.). And touch all that he hath; or, smite all that he hath; i.e. ruin him, strip him of his possessions. And he will curse thee to thy face. Professor Lee translates, \"If not, he will bless thee to thy face;\" the LXX., \"Surely he will bless thee to thy face;\" Canon Cook, \"See if he will not renounce thee openly.\" But the majority of Hebraists agree with the Authorized Version. Satan suggests that, if Job be stripped of his possessions, he will openly curse God, and renounce his worship. Here he did not so much calumniate, or lie, as show the evil thoughts that were in his own heart. No doubt he believed that Job would act as he said.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; literally, in thy hand, as in the margin. God withdraws his protection from Job's possessions; he does not himself take them away, as Satan had suggested (ver. 11); but he allows Satan, who can do nothing without his allowance, to deal with them as he pleases. As God dispenses blessings through the angelic host (Psalm 91:11, 12; Hebrews 1:14), so he, sometimes at any rate, allows spirits of evil to be the ministers of his chastisements. Only upon himself put not forth thine hand. The person of Job was not to be touched as yet. He was to be injured only in his belongings. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. Having obtained a permission which he thought would serve his purpose, Satan did not delay, but promptly departed, to take advantage of the permission given him. To be in the presence of God must be an intense pain to the evil one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house. One of the birthdays, the eldest brother's probably, had come round, and the ordinary gathering (see ver. 4) had taken place - the feasting and drinking had begun, while the father, remaining in his own house, was perhaps interceding with God for his children, or anxiously considering the possibility that, in their light-hearted merriment, they might have put God away altogether from their thoughts, and So have practically renounced him, when the series of calamities began. How often calamity comes to us when we are least expecting it, when all seems quiet about us, when everything is prospering - nay, even when a high festival-time has come, and the joy-bells are sounding in our ears, and our 'hearts are elated within us! Job was, at any rate, spared the sudden plunge from exuberant joy into the depths of woe. It was his habit to preserve an even temper, and neither to be greatly exalted, nor, unless under an extremity of suffering, to be greatly depressed. He was now, however, about to be subjected to a fiery trial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses (literally, the she-asses) feeding beside them (literally, at their hand). Note that, notwithstanding the festival, labour was still going on; there was no general holiday; the oxen were at work in the field, not perhaps all of them, but the greater number, for the ploughing-time is short in the Oriental countries, and the \"earing\" is all done at the same time. The bulk of Job's labourers were probably engaged in the business, and they had brought the asses with them, probably to keep them under their eye, lest thieves should carry them off, when the catastrophe related in the next verse occurred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And the Sabeans (literally, Sheba) fell upon them, and took them away. The Sabeans were the principal people of Arabia in ancient times, and the name seems to be used sometimes in the general sense of \"Arabs\" (see Psalm 72:10, 15; Jeremiah 6:20). We may suppose that hem, either the general sense is intended, or, if the specific one, then that, at the date whereto the story of Job belongs, there were Sabeans in Eastern as well as in Southern Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Upper Persian Gulf as well as in the neighbourhood of the Indian Ocean. The plundering habits of all the Arab tribes are well known. Strabo says that the Sabeans, even at the height of their prosperity, made excursions for the sake of plunder into Arabia Petraea and even Syria (Strab., 16:4) Yea, they have slain; rather, they slew, or they smote. The servants; literally, the young men; i.e. the labourers who were engaged in ploughing, and would be in duty bound to resist the carrying off of the cattle. With the edge of the sword. The lance is the chief weapon of the modern Bedouin, but it may have been different anciently. Or the expression used may merely mean \"with weapons of war.\" And I only am escaped alone to tell thee. Professor Lee translates, \"And I have hardly escaped alone to tell thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - While he was yet speaking; literally, he yet speaking; ἔτι τούτον λαλοῦντος, LXX. The writer hurries his words to express the rapidity with which one announcement followed another (see vers. 17, 18). There came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven. \"The fire of God\" is undoubtedly lightning (comp. Numbers 11:1-3; 2 Kings 1:10, 14; Psalm 78:21). This Satan, under permission, might wield, as being \"the prince of the power of the air\" (Ephesians 2:2): but there is, no doubt, something very extraordinary in a storm extending over the pastures occupied by nine thousand sheep, and destroying the whole of them (Cook) Still, it cannot be said that such a storm is impossible; and perhaps the damage done was not greater than that which followed on the seventh Egyptian plague (see Exodus 9:18-26). And hath burned up the sheep, and the servants; literally, the young men; i.e. the shepherds who were in attendance upon the sheep. And consumed them; literally, devoured them. Fire is often said to \"devour\" what it destroys. \"The Egyptians,\" says Herodotus, \"believe fire to be a live animal, which eats whatever it can seize, and then, glutted with the food, dies with the matter which it feeds upon\" (Herod., 3:16). And I only am escaped alone to tell thee (see the comment on ver. 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - While he was yet speaking, there came also another (see the comment on ver. 16). The exact repetition of a clause, without the alteration of a word or a letter, is very archaic (comp. Genesis 1:4, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; and for another repetition, Genesis 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25). And said, The Chaldeans; literally, the Casdim (כַשְׂדִים), which is the word uniformly used in the Hebrew where the Authorized Version has \"Chaldeans\" or \"Chaldees.\" The native name seems to have been Kaldi or Kaldai, whence the Greek Ξαλδαῖοι, and the Latin Chaldaei. It is very difficult to account for the Hebrews having substituted a sibilant for the liquid; but it was certainly done from the earliest period of their literature (Genesis 11:31) to the latest (see Targums, passim). Some derive the Hebrew Casdim from \"Chesed,\" one of the sons of Nahor (Genesis 22:22); but Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees before Chesed was born (Genesis 22:20). And there is no evidence of any connection between Chesed, who was born at Haran, and the Babylonian Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were probably early settlers in Babylonia; by degrees they were pressed to the south, and gave the name of Chaldea to Lower Babylonia, or the tract nearest to the Persian Gulf (Strab., 16:1, § 66; Ptolemy, 'Geographia,' 5:20). From a remote date they were a settled and civilized people; but no doubt originally they had the same predatory instincts as their neighbours. Made out three bands. Professor Lee translates, \"appointed three captains,\" which is a possible meaning of the words; but the weight of authority supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. And fell upon the camels. Perhaps the most valuable part of Job's possessions. Three thousand camels would be regarded as a splendid capture by any body of Oriental marauders. And have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants (literally, the young men, as in ver. 16) with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee (compare the comment on ver. 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said (see the comment on ver. 16), Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house (comp. ver. 13). It is a common proverb that \"misfortunes never come singly.\" Shakespeare says they \"come not single foes, but in battalions.\" Still, so overwhelming a series of calamities falling upon a single individual all in one day could not but strike those who heard of them as abnormal, and almost certainly supernatural. So Job's friends concluded (Job 5:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness; rather, from across the wilderness - a wind which began in the region lying on the other side of the wilderness, and sweeping across it, came with full force upon the inhabited tract where Job and his sons were dwelling. The desert winds are often very violent. Generally they are Laden with heavy clouds of fine sand, which cause intolerable discomfort and thirst; but when they sweep over a rocky and gravelly region, they are simply of extreme violence, without other distressing feature. They then resemble the hurricanes or tornadoes of the West Indies. We may reasonably connect this hurricane with the thunderstorm of ver. 16. And smote the four corners of the house, and it fell. The \"houses\" of the East are not the solid structures of heavy timber, brick, and stone to which we of the West are accustomed, but light fabrics of planks and palisades, thatched mostly with reeds. Houses of this kind, when the rain descends, and the winds blow and beat against them (Matthew 7:6), readily fall. Upon the young men; rather, the young persons. Na'ar (נער) is of both genders in early Hebrew (see Genesis 24:14, etc.). And they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. Again, the calamity has a completeness which marks it as supernatural. The fall of a house does not usually destroy all the inmates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Then Job arose. Not till the last calamity was announced did Job stir. The loss of his wealth little moved him. But when he heard that his children were destroyed, all of them \"at one fell swoop,\" then he could endure no longer, but rose from the seat on which he was sitting, and showed forth his grief. First he rent his mantle, \"the outer robe worn by men of rank\" (Cook) - a customary sign of grief in the ancient world (Genesis 37:29, 34; Genesis 44:13; 1 Kings 21:27; 2 Kings 19:1; Esther 4:1; Joel 2:13; Herod., 8:99; Livy, 1:13, etc.); then he shaved his head - another less usual but still not uncommon sign of grief, forbidden under the Law of the Jews (Leviticus 21:5; Deuteronomy 14:1), but widely practised by the Gentiles (Isaiah 15:2; Jeremiah 47:5; Jeremiah 48:37; Herod., 2:36; 9:24; Plut.,'Vit. Pelop.,' § 34; Q. Gurt.,'Vit. Alex.,' 10:5, § 17). And fell down upon the ground, and worshipped. After giving vent to his natural grief, Job made an act of adoration. Recognizing the fact that adversity, as well as prosperity comes from God, and submitting himself to the Divine will, he \"worshipped.\" How often has his act flashed across the minds of Christians. and enabled them, in their dark hour, to imitate him, and repeat his words, \"The Lord gave,\" etc.!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither. There is some difficulty in the word \"thither,\" since no man returns to his mother's womb (John 3:4), at death or otherwise. The expression must not be pressed. It arises out of the analogy, constantly felt and acknowledged, between \"mother\" earth and a man's actual mother (setup. Psalm 129:15). The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Job is here represented as knowing God by his name \"Jehovah,\" though elsewhere the \"great Name\" appears once only in the words of Job (Job 12:9), and never in the words of his friends. The natural conclusion is that the name was known in the land of Uz at the time, but was very rarely used - scarcely, except in moments of excitement. Blessed be the Name of the Lord; literally, may the Name of Jehovah be blessed! The ermphatic word is kept for the last. According to Satan, Job was to have\" cursed God to his face\" (ver. 11). The event is that he openly and resolutely blesses God. That the same word is used in its two opposite senses rather accentuates the antithesis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In all this Job sinned not. It was only the commencement of the probation; but so far, at any rate, Job had not sinned - he had preserved his integrity, had spoken and done rightly. Nor charged God foolishly; literally, gave not folly to God, which is explained to mean either \"did not attribute to God anything inconsistent with wisdom and goodness\" (Delitzsch, Merx), or \"did not utter any foolishness against God\" (Ewald, Dillmann, Cook). The latter is probably the true meaning (comp. Job 6:6; Job 24:12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-29. - Zophar's second speech is even more harsh than his first (ch. 11.). He adds coarseness and rudeness to his former vehement hostility (vers. 7, 15). His whole discourse is a covert denunciation of Job as a wicked man and a hypocrite (vers. 5, 12, 19, 29), deservedly punished by God for a life of crime. He ends by prophesying Job's violent death, the destruction of his house, and the rising up of heaven and earth in witness against him (vers. 24-28). Verses 1, 2. - Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer. Zophar \"has heard the check of his reproach\" (ver. 3), i.e. the reproach contained in the last words of Job in the preceding chapter. Therefore his thoughts rise up within him, and com-psi him to make a reply. He cannot allow Job to shift the onus of guilt and the menace of punishment on his friends, when it is he, Job, that is the guilty person, over whom the judgments of God impend. And for this I make haste; rather, and because of my haste that is within me (see the Revised Version); i.e. \"because I am of a hasty and impetuous temperament.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I have heard the check of my reproach; or, the reproof which putteth me to shame (Revised Version). Some suppose an allusion to Job 19:2, 3; but it is better to regard Zophar as enraged by vers. 28, 29 of Job 19. And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. This claim is not quite consistent with the acknowledgment of hastiness in ver. 2. But it is no unusual thing for an impetuous and hasty man to declare that he speaks from the dictates of pure dispassionate reason.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth? These words scarcely \"imply cognizance of the record (of the creation of man) in Genesis,\" as Canon Cook suggests; but they do imply belief in a creation of man, not an evolution; and in the existence of a continuous tradition, extending from that time to Job's. The passage is among those which make for the high antiquity of the book.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That the triumphing of the wicked is short (comp. Psalm 37:35, 36; Psalm 51:1-5; Psalm 73:17-19, etc.). This is one of the main points of dispute between Job and his opponents. It has been previously maintained by Eliphaz (Job 4:8-11; Job 5:3-5; Job 15:21, 29) and by Bildad (Job 8:11-19), as it is now by Zophar, and may be regarded as the traditional belief of the time, which scarcely any ventured to question. His own observation, however, has convinced Job that the fact is otherwise. He has seen the wicked \"live, become old, and remain mighty in power\" (Job 21:7); he has seen them \"spend their days in wealth,\" and die quietly, as \"in a moment\" (Job 21:13). In Job 24:2-24 he seems to argue that this is the general, if not universal, lot of such persons. Later on, however, in Job 27:13-23, he retracts this view, or, at any rate, greatly modifies it, admitting that usually retribution does even in this life overtake the wicked. And this seems to be the general sentiment of mankind.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Raro antecedentem scelestum,NEWLINEDeseruit pede poena claudlo.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Horace, 'Od.,' 3:2, ll. 31, 32.) There remains, however, the question whether the triumphing of the wicked can fairly be considered \"short,\" and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. When we consider the lives of Dionysius the elder, Sylla, Marius, Tiberius, Louis XIV., Napoleon, it is difficult to answer this question in the affirmative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Though his excellency mount up to the heavens. \"Though he reach,\" i.e., \"the highest pitch of prosperity\" (comp.

Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. A \"vision of the night\" is perhaps something more than a \"dream;\" but it is equally fugitive, equally unstable-with morning it wholly vanishes away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; or, the eye which scanned him. The verb used (שָׁזַך) is a rare one, occurring only here, in Job 28:7, and in Song of Solomon 1:6. In the former passage it is used of a falcon, in the latter of the sun. Neither shall his place any more behold him (comp. Psalm 103:16, \"The place thereof shall know it no more\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - His children shall seek to please the poor. Another rendering is, \"The poor shall oppress his children,\" since the meaning of the verb יְרַצּוּ is doubtful. But the translation of the Authorized Version seems preferable. His children will curry favour with the poor, either by making restitution to them on account of their father's injuries, or simply because they are friendless, and desire to ingratiate themselves with some one. And his hands shall restore their goods (comp. vers. 15 and 18). He himself will be so crushed and broken in spirit that he will give back with his own hands the goods whereof he has deprived the poor. The restitution, i.e., will be made, in many cases, not by the oppressor's children, but by the oppressor himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - His bones are full of the sin of his youth; literally, his bones are full of his youth; i.e. lusty and strong, full of youthful vigour. There is no sign of weakness or decay about them. Yet they shall lie down with him in the dust. A little while, and these vigorous bones, this entire body, so full of life and youth, shall be lying with the man himself, with all that constitutes his personality, in the dust of death (comp. vers. 24, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth; i.e. though the wicked man delight in his wickedness, and gloat over it, and keep the thought of it in his mind, as a gourmand keeps, so long as he can, a delicious taste in his mouth; though he, as it were, hide it under his tongue, in order not to let it escape him; though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth, yet, notwithstanding all this, disgust and nausea arrive in course of time (see the next two verses). It is, perhaps, the most surprising among the phenomena of wickedness that men can gloat over it, voluntarily recur to it, make a boast of it, recount signal instances of it to their friends, and seem to find a satisfaction in the recollection. One would have expected that shame and self-disapproval and fear of retribution would have led them to dismiss their wicked acts from their thoughts as soon as possible. But certainly the fact is otherwise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Yet his meat in his bowels is turned. Still, a time comes when the self-complacency of the wicked man is shaken. He experiences a failure of health or spirits. Then, suddenly, it is as if the meat that he has swallowed had been turned to poison in his bowels, as if the gall of asps were within him. Compare what Bishop Butler says of the sudden waking up of a man's conscience ('Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 2. p. 52). The ancients seem to have known that the poison of serpents was a strong acid, and therefore supposed that it was secreted by the gallbladder (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 11:37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again. The wicked man shall be made to disgorge his ill-gotten gains. Either fear, or remorse, or a judicial sentence will force him to make restitution (see ver. 10). God shall cast them out of his belly. Whatever is the immediate motive of the restitution: it will really be God's doing. He will cause the fear, or the remorse, or bring about the judicial sentence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He shall suck the poison of asps. Probably Zophar does not affix any very distinct meaning to his threats. He is content to utter a series of fierce-sounding but vague menaces, which he knows that Job will regard as launched against himself, and does not care whether they are taken metaphorically or literally. Job will be equally distressed in either ease. The viper's tongue shall slay him. It is really the viper's tooth, and not his tongue, that slays; but Zophar is not, any more than Job (Job 27:18), an accomplished naturalist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks. The wicked man shall suffer, not only positive pains, but what casuists call the peens damni, or \"penalty of loss\" - deprivation, in other words, of blessings which he would naturally have enjoyed but for his wickedness. Zophar here threatens him with the Joss of those paradisiacal delights which the Orientals associated with water in all its forms, whether as פּלגות, or \"rills derived from larger streams,\" or as כהרי, \"rivers,\" or as כחלי, \"brooks\" or \"torrents,\" now strong and impetuous, now reduced to a mere thread These are said poetically to flow with honey and butter, not, of course, in any literal sense, such as Ovid may have meant, when, in describing the golden age, he said -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Flumina jam lactis, jam fiumina nectaris ibant;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Metaph.,' 1:111.) but as fertilizing the land through which they ran, and so causing it to abound with bees and cattle, whence would be derived butter and honey. Compare the terms in which Canaan was described to the Israelites (Exodus 3:8, 17; Exodus 13:5; Deuteronomy 26:9, 15, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - That which he laboured for he shall restore. Even that which he gets by his own honest labour he shall have to part with and give up. He shall not swallow it down; i.e. \"shall not absorb it, and make it his own.\" According to his substance shall the restitution be. So Schultens, Professor Lee, and Dr. Stanley Leathes, who understand Zophar as asserting that, in order to compensate those whom he has robbed, the wicked man will have to make over to them all the wealth that is honestly his Others translate, \"According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice\" (see the Revised Version, and the commentaries of Ewald, Delitzsch, and Dillmann).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor. These charges are now for the first time insinuated against Job; later on, they are openly brought by Eliphaz (Job 22:5-9). Job denies them categorically in Job 29:11-17. They seem to have been pure calumnies, without an atom of foundation. Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not. Another calumny, doubtless. Something like it was insinuated by Eliphaz in Job 15:28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly; rather, became he knew no quietness in his belly or within him (see the Revised Version); i.e. because his greed and his rapacity were insatiable - he was never at rest, but continually oppressed and plundered the poor more and more (see the comment on ver. 19). He shall not save of that which he desired; or, he shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth (see the Revised Version). For his oppression, for his violence, for his insatiable greed, he shall be punished by retaining nothing of all those delightful things which he had laid up for himself during the time that he was powerful and prosperousNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - There shall none of his meat be left; rather, there was nothing left that he detoured not, or nothing remained over from his eating (Schultens). Scarcely intended literally, as Canon Cook supposes. Rather said in reference to the wicked man's persistent oppression and robbery of the poor, the needy, and the powerless (comp. vers. 19, 20; and note our Lord's words, \"Ye devour widows' houses,\" Matthew 23:14). Therefore shall no man look for his goods. This is an impossible rendering. Translate, with Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, and our Revisers, therefore his prosperity shall not endure. In other words, a Nemesis shall overtake him. For his oppression and cruelty he shall be visited by the Divine auger; a sudden end shall be made of his prosperity, and he shall fall into penury and misfortune. Covert allusion is, no doubt, intended to Job's sudden loss of his extraordinary prosperity by the series of calamities so graphically portrayed in Job 1:13-19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits. Even while his wealth and prosperity remain, he shall find himself in difficulties, since every hand of the wicked (or rather, the hand of every one that is wretched) shall come upon him; i.e. all those who are poor and miserable, especially such as he has made poor and miserable, shall turn against him, and vex him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - When he is about to fill his belly (comp. vers. 12-18); i.e. \"when he is on the point of making some fresh attack upon the weak and defenceless.\" God shall east the fury of his wrath upon him (comp. Psalm 78:30, 31, where a far less harmful lust is noted as having brought down the Divine vengeance). And shall rain it upon him while he is eating; or, as his food (comp. Psalm 11:6, \"Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He shall flee from the iron weapon. This is no indication of the late authorship of Job. Iron was in use in Egypt at a very early date. A thin plate of it was found by Colonel Howard Vyse embedded in the masonry of the great pyramid; and iron implements and ornaments, iron spear-heads, iron sickles, iron gimlets, iron keys, iron bracelets, iron wire, have been found in the early tombs not infrequently (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 505). That they are not more common is accounted for by the rapid oxidization of iron by exposure to the air, and its rapid decay in the nitrous soil of Egypt. The inhabitants of South-Western Asia were at no time much behind the Egyptians in their knowledge of the useful arts: and iron appears as a well-known metal in the Jewish Scriptures from the time of the Exodus (see Numbers 35:16; Deuteronomy 3:11; Deuteronomy 4:20; Deuteronomy 8:9; Deuteronomy 28:23; Joshua 8:31). It is true that the principal weapons of war continued to be made ordinarily of bronze, both in South-Western Asia and in Egypt, till a comparatively late period; but Zophar may mean to assign to the slayer of the wicked man weapons of a superior character. And the bow of steel shall strike him through. It is uncertain whether steel was known in the ancient world. But, whether or no, \"steel\" is not meant here. The word used in the original is nehushtah, which undoubtedly means either \"copper\" or \"bronze.\" As copper would be too soft a material for a bow, we may assume bronze to be intended. The bronze used in Egypt was extremely elastic, and there would have been little difficulty in fashioning bows of it (on the existence of such bows, see 2 Samuel 26:5; Psalm 18:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; rather, he draweth it forth and it cometh out of his body (see the Revised Version). The stricken man draws the arrow from his flesh, the natural action of every one so wounded. If the arrow was simply tipped with a smooth iron point, it would be easy to withdraw it; but a barbed arrow could only be cut out. Yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall; rather, the glittering point. The arrow is supposed to have pierced the gall-bladder, and to be drawn forth from it. There would be little chance of recovery in such a case. Hence terrors are upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - All darkness shall be hid in his secret places; literally, all darkness is reserved for his treasures' which some understand of his hidden earthly treasures, which no one shall ever find - some of the retribution laid up for him by God, which will be such darkness as Job describes in Job 10:21, 22. A fire not blown shall consume him; i.e. \"a fire lighted by no human hands,\" probably lightning or brimstone from heaven (Job his tent, i.e. in his dwelling. His wife, his children, if he has any, and his domestics, shall be involved in the general ruin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. This is Zophar's reply to the appeal which Job made (in Job 16:18, 19) to heaven and earth to bear their witness in his favour. Heaven, he says, instead of testifying to his innocence, will one day, when the books are opened (Revelation 20:12), \"reveal his iniquity;\" and earth, instead of echoing his cry, will \"rise up\" in indignation \"against him.\" He will have none either in heaven or earth to take his part, or give any testimony in his favour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The increase of his house shall depart. \"The increase of his house\" may be either his children and descendants; or his substance - that which he has accumulated. In the former case, the departure spoken of may be either death (see ver. 26), or carrying into captivity; in the latter, general rapine and destruction. And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. It seems to be necessary to supply some such nominative as \"his goods,\" or \"his treasure,\" צפוניו (see ver. 26). These shall \"flow away,\" i.e. melt and disappear, \"in the day of his wrath,\" i.e. the day when wrath comes upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - This is the portion of a wicked man from God; i.e. the lot, or possession of a wicked man - that which God makes over to him as his own in the last resort, and which is all that he has to look for. In other words, it is the heritage appointed unto him by God (comp. Job 27:13). As to some God, at the last, will assign an inheritance of good, so to others he will appoint an inheritance of evilNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-34. - Job answers Zophar, as he had answered Bildad, in a single not very lengthy chapter. After a few caustic introductory remarks (vers. 2-4), he takes up the challenge which Zophar had thrown out, respecting the certain punishment, in this life, of the wicked (Job 20:4-29), and maintains, \"in language of unparalleled boldness\" (Cook), the converse of the proposition. The wicked, he says, live, grow old, attain to great power, have a numerous and flourishing offspring, prosper, grow rich, spend their time in feasting and jollity - nay, openly renounce God and decline to pray to him - yet suffer no harm, and when they die, go down to the grave without suffering, \"in a moment\" (vers. 5-15). To the suggestion that from time to time they are cut off suddenly in a signal way, he answers, \"How often is this?\" or rather, \"How seldom!\" (vers. 17, 18). To the further suggestion that they are punished in their children he replies, \"How much better if they were punished in their own persons!\" (vers. 19-21). As it is, he argues, one event happens to all (vers. 23-26). In conclusion, he observes that common opinion supports his view (vers. 29-33), and denounces as futile the attempts of his comforters to convince him, since his views and theirs respecting the facts of God's government are diametrically opposed to each other (ver. 34). Verses 1, 2. - But Job answered and said, Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. As ye have no other consolation to offer me, at least attend diligently to what I say. That will be some comfort to me, and I will accept it in lieu of the consolations which I might have looked for at your hands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSuffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Suffer me that I may speak; or, suffer me, and I also will speak. There is an emphasis on the \"I\" (אנכי). Job implies that his opponents are not allowing him his fair share of the argument, which is an accusation that can scarcely be justified. Since the dialogue opened, Job's speeches have occupied eleven chapters, those of his \"comforters\" seven only. But a controversialist who has much to say is apt to think that sufficient time is not allowed him. And after that I have spoken, mock on. Job does not hope to convince, or silence, or shame the other interlocutors. When he has said his say, all that he expects is mockery and derision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - As for me, is my complaint to man? Do I address myself to man, pour out my complaint to him, and expect him to redress my wrongs? No; far otherwise. I address myself to God, from whom alone I can look for effectual assistance. And if it were so; rather, and if so, if this is the case, if my appeal is to God, and he makes me no answer, then why should not my spirit be troubled? or, Why should I not be impatient? (Revised Version). Job thinks that he has a right to be impatient, if God does not vouchsafe him an answer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - Here we have an abrupt transition. Job is about to controvert Zophar's theory of the certain retribution that overtakes the wicked man in this life, and to maintain that, on the contrary, he usually prospers (vers. 7-18). Knowing that, in thus running counter to the general religious teaching, he will arouse much horror and indignation on the part of those who hear him, he prefaces his remarks with a notice that they will cause astonishment, and an acknowledgment that he himself cannot reflect upon the subject without a feeling of alarm and dismay. He thus hopes partially to disarm his opponents. Verse 5. - Mark me; literally, look to me; i.e. \"attend to me,\" for I am about to say something well worth attention. And be astonished. Prepare yourselves, i.e., for something that will astonish you. And lay your hand upon your mouth. Harpocrates, the Egyptian god of silence, was often represented with his finger on his lips (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 362). The symbolism is almost universal. Job begs his auditors to \"refrain their lips,\" and, however much astonished, to keep silence until he has concluded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Even when I remember; i.e. \"when I think upon the subject.\" I am afraid, and trembling taketh held on my flesh. A shudder runs through his whole frame. His words will, he knows, seem to verge upon impiety.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? Job asks for an explanation of the facts which his own experience has impressed upon him. He has seen that \"the wicked live\" quite as long as the righteous, that in many cases they attain to a ripe old age, and become among the powerful of the earth. The great \"pyramid kings\" of Egypt, whose cruel oppressions were remembered down to the time of Herodotus (Herod., 2:124-128), reigned respectively, according to Egyptian tradition, sixty-three and sixty-six years(Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 2.). Rameses II., the cruel oppressor of the Jews, and the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled, had a reign of sixty-seven years ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 301).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Their seed is established in their sight with them (comp. Psalm 17:14; and see below, Job 27:14). It could scarcely be doubted that the wicked had as many children as the righteous, and often established them in posts of honour and emolument. And their offspring before their eyes. A pleonastic repetition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Their houses are safe from fear; literally, their houses are in peace without fear. Neither is the rod of God upon them. So Asaph, \"They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men\" (Psalm 73:5). The chastening rod of God does not seem to smite them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; rather, their cow conceiveth . Shor (שׁור), which is of both genders, must here be taken as feminine. Their cow (rather, their heifer) calveth, and casteth not her calf. Both conception and birth are prosperous; there is neither barrenness nor abortion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They send forth their little ones like a flock. Free, i.e. joyful and frolicsome, to disport themselves as they please. The picture is charmingly idyllic. And their children dance. Frisk, i.e. \"and skip, and leap,\" like the young of cattle full of health, and in the enjoyment of plenty\" (Lee).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. The \"timbrel\" (תפ) is probably the tambourine, an instrument used from a remote antiquity by the Orientals. It consisted of a round hoop of wood, into which were sometimes inserted jingling rings of metal, and upon which was stretched at one end a sheet of parchment. It is represented on the monuments both of Egypt and Phoenicia ('Hist. of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 522; 'Hist. of Phoenicia,' pp. 219, 223). The harp (כִנּור) was, in the early times, a very simple instrument, consisting of a framework of wood, across which were stretched from four to seven strings, which were of catgut and of different lengths, and were sounded either with the hand or with a plectrum. The \"organ\" (עוּנָב) was, of course, not an organ in the modern sense of the word. It was either a pan's pipe, which is a very primitive instrument, or more probably a double reed blown from the end, like a flageolet, examples of which are found in the remains both of Egypt and Phoenicia ('Hist. of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 524; 'Hist. of Phoenicia,' l.s c.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. They die, i.e. without suffering from any prolonged or severe illness, such as that grievous affliction from which Job himself was suffering. Probably Job does not mean to maintain all this absolutely, or as universally the case, but he wishes to force his friends to acknowledge that there are many exceptions to their universal law, that wickedness is always visited in this world with condign punishment, and he wants them to account for them exceptions (see ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us. It is this impunity which leads the wicked to renounce God altogether. They think that they get on very well without God, and consequently have no need to serve him. Job puts their thoughts into words (vers. 14, 15), and thus very graphically represents their tone of feeling. For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. The wicked feel no interest in God; they do not trouble themselves about him; his ways are \"far above out of their sight,\" and they do not care to know them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? \"Who is Jehovah,\" said Pharaoh to Moses, \"that I should obey his voice? I know not Jehovah\" (Exodus 5:2). So the ungodly in Job's time. They pretend to have no knowledge of God, no sense of his claims upon them, no internal consciousness that they are bound to worship and obey him. They are agnostics of a pronounced type, or at least they profess to be such. What profit, they ask, should we have, if we pray to him? Expediency is everything with them. Will serving God do them any good? Will it advance their worldly interests? Persuade them of that, and they will be willing to pay him, at any rate, a lip-service. But, having prospered so long and so greatly without making any religious profession, they see no reason to believe that they would prosper more if they made one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Lo, their good is not in their hand; i.e. their prosperity is not in their own power, not the result of their own efforts. God's providence is, at least, one element in it, since he exalts men and abases them, he casteth down and lifteth up. Hence it would seem to follow that they are his favourites. Shall Job therefore cast in his lot with them? No, he says, a thousand times, No! The counsel of the wicked is far from me; or better, be the counsel of the wicked far from me! I will have nothing to do with it. I will cling to God. I will maintain my integrity. Satan had charged Job with serving God for the sake of temporal reward. Job had disproved the charge by still clinging to God, notwithstanding all his afflictions. Now he goes further, and declines to throw in his lot with the wicked, even although it should appear that the balance of prosperity is with them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? This is not an exclamation, but a question, and is well rendered in the Revised Version, \"How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?\" Is not the signal downfall of the wicked prosperous man a comparatively rare occur-fence? How oft cometh their destruction upon them*. When the problem here propounded came before Asaph, he seems to have solved it by the supposition that in all cases retribution visited the wicked in this life, and that they were cast down from their prosperity. \"I went,\" he says, \"into the sanctuary of God; then understood I the end of these men. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image\" (Psalm 73:17-20). Job maintains that such a catastrophe happens but seldom, and that for the most part the wicked go down to the grave in peace. God distributeth sorrows in his anger. This is hot an independent clause. The sense runs on: How off is it that the candle of the wicked is put out and that destruction cometh upon them and God showers sorrows upon them in his anger? (compare the comment on the next verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away; rather, How oft is it that they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff etc.? The construction begun in the first clause of ver. 17 is carried on to the end of ver. 18. \"Stubble\" and \"chaff\" are ordinary figures for foolish and ungodly men, whom the blast of God's anger swoops away to destruction (comp. Exodus 15:7; Psalm 1:4; Psalm 35:5; Psalm 83:13; Isaiah 27:13; Isaiah 29:5; Isaiah 41:2, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Job supposes his opponents to make this answer to his arguments. \"God,\" they may say, \"punishes the wicked man in his children\" (comp. Exodus 20:5). Job does not deny that he may do so, but suggests a better course in the next sentence. He rewardeth him; rather, let him recompense it on himself - let him make the wicked man himself suffer, and then he shall know it. He shall perceive and know that he is receiving the due reward of his wickedness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - His eyes shall see his destruction (or, let his own eyes see his destruction), and he shall drink (or, let him drink) of the wrath of the Almighty. It will impress him far more with a sense of his wickedness, and of his guilt in God's sight, if he receives punishment in his own person, than if he merely suffers vicariously through his children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. ? For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? What does he care, ordinarily, about the happiness of his children and descendants? \"Apres moi le deluge\" is the selfish thought of bad men generally, when they cast a glance at the times which are to follow their decease. The fate of those whom they leave behind them troubles them but little. It would scarcely cause them a pang to know that their posterity would soon be \"clean put out.\" When the number of his months is cut off in the midst; i.e. when his appointed time is come, and he knows that \"the number of his months' is accomplished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Shall any teach God knowledge? Job has been searching the \"deep things of God,\" speculating upon the method of the Divine government of the world, he has perhaps rashly ventured to \"rush in where angels fear to tread.\" Now, however, he cheeks himself with the confession that God's ways are inscrutable, his knowledge far beyond any knowledge possessed by man. Men must not presume to judge him; it is for him to judge them. Seeing he judgeth those that are high. None so exalted, none so advanced in wisdom and knowledge, none so venturesome in sounding depths that they cannot fathom, but God is above them, judges them, knows their hearts, and, according to his infallible wisdom, condemns or approves them. This is a chastening thought, and its effect on Job is to make him contract his sails, and, leaving the empyrean, content himself with s lower flight. Previously he has maintained, as if he were admitted to the Divine counsels, that the prosperity of the wicked was a rule of God's government. Now he goes no further than to say that there is no rule discoverable. Happiness and misery are dispensed - as far as man can see - on no definite principle, and, at the end, one lot happens to all: all go down into the tomb, and lie in the dust, and the worms devour them (vers. 23-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. Some continue healthy and vigorous in body, peaceful and satisfied in mind, up to the very moment of their departure (comp. ver. 13, \"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - His breasts are full of milk; rather, his milk-pails, as in the margin. The main wealth of the time being cattle, the man whose milk-pails are always full is the prosperous man. And his bones are moistened with marrow. Being thus wealthy and prosperous, his body is fat and well nourished. Verse 24. - And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul. Others have to suffer terribly before death comes to them. Their whole life is wretched, and their spirit is embittered by their misfortunes. And never eateth with pleasure; rather, and never tasteth of good (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. However different the circumstances of their life, men are alike in their death. One event happens to all. All die, are laid in the dust, and become the prey of worms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices (or, surmisings) which ye wrongfully imagine against me. I know, i.e. what you think of me. I am quite aware that you regard me as having brought my afflictions upon myself by wicked deeds, which I have succeeded in keeping secret. You have not openly stated your surmises. but it has been easy for me to \"read between the lines,\" and understand the true meaning of your insinuations, which are all wrongful and unjust.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? i.e. \"What has become of the house of the powerful man (Job himself)? How is it fallen and gone to decay!\" And whore are the dwelling-places (literally, the tent of the habitations) of the wicked! Again Job is intended, although the insult is veiled by the plural form being used. Job supposes that his opponents will meet his statement, that the righteous are afflicted and the wicked prosper, by pointing to his own case as one in which wickedness has been punished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Have ye not asked them that go by the way? Job refers his opponents to the first comer (τὸν ἐπιόντα) - the merest passer-by. Let them ask his opinion, and see if he does not consider that, as a general rule, the wicked prosper. And do ye not know their tokens? or, their observations; i.e. the conclusions to which they have come upon the subject from their own observation and experience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - These conclusions are now set forth. They are, that the wicked is reserved for (or rather, spared in) the day of destruction, and that they shall be brought forth to (rather, removed out of the way in) the day of wrath. This, according to Job, was the popular sentiment of his time; and, no doubt, there is in all ages a large mass of fleeting opinion to the same effect. Striking examples of wickedness in high places draw attention, and provoke indignation, and are much talked about; whence arises an idea that such cases are common, and ultimately, by an unscientific generalization in the vulgar mind, that they form the rule, and not the exception to the rule. It requires some power of intellect to take a broad and comprehensive view over the whole of human life, and fairly to strike the balance. Such a view seems to have been taken by Bishop Butler (among others); and the conclusion, reached by calm investigation and philosophic thought, is that, on the whole, ever in this life, the balance of advantage rests with the virtuous, who really prosper more than the wicked, have greater and higher satisfactions, escape numerous forms of suffering, and approach more nearly to happiness. An exact apportionment of happiness and misery to desert is a thing that certainly in this life does not take place; but the tendency of virtue to accumulate to itself other goods is clear; and Job's pessimistic view is certainly an untrue one, which we may suspect that he maintained, rather from a love of paradox, and from a desire to puzzle and confuse his friends, than from any conviction of its absolute truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31 - Who shall declare his way to his face? rather, Who shall denounce? i.e. Who will be bold enough to tell the rich and powerful man that he is wicked? that his \"way,\" or course of life, is altogether wrong? And who shall repay him what he hath done? Still less will any one be found who will take upon him to attack such a one, to prosecute him in courts or otherwise bring him to condign punishment. Thus, being castigated neither by God nor man, he enjoys complete impunity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Yet shall he be brought to the grave; rather, he moreover is borne (in pomp) to the grave. Even in death the advantage is still with the wicked man. He is borne in procession to the grave - a mausoleum or a family vault - by a long train of mourners, who weep and lament for him, and pay him funeral honours. The poor virtuous man, on the other hand, is hastily thrust under the soil. And shall remain in in the tomb; or shall keep watch over his tomb. The allusion is probably to the custom, common certainly in Egypt and Phoenicia, of carving a figure of the deceased on the lid of his sarcophagus, to keep as it were watch over the remains deposited within. The figure was sometimes accompanied by an inscription, denouncing curses on those who should dare to violate the tomb or disturb the remains (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 112-114; and compare the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' pp. 393-395).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him. In his mausoleum, by the side of the running stream, the very clods of the valley, wherein his tomb is placed, shall be sweet and pleasant to him - death thus losing half its terrors. And all men shall draw after him. Some explain this of the lengthy funeral procession which follows his corpse to the grave, and take the next clause of the multitude, not forming part of the procession, who gather together at the tomb beforehand, waiting to see the obsequies; but, as Rosenmuller remarks, this explanation seems precluded by the previous mention of the funeral procession (ver 32), besides being otherwise unsatisfactory. The real reference is probably to the common topic of consolation implied in the \"Omnes eodem cogimur\" of Horace. He is happy in his death, or at any rate not unhappy, seeing that he only suffers the common fate. He will draw after him all future men, who will likewise inevitably perish, just as there are innumerable before him, who have travelled the same read and reached the same resting-place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob21:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? Your position, that the godly always prosper, while the wicked are afflicted and brought low, being an absolutely false one, your attempts to console and comfort me are wholly vain and futile. Why continue them? Most commentators consider the second colloquy here to end, and a pause to occur, before Eliphaz resumes the argument.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-30. - Eliphaz returns to the attack, but with observations that are at first strangely pointless and irrelevant, e.g. on the unprofitableness of man to God (vers. l, 2), and on the slight importance of Job's case (ver. 3). After this weak prelude, however, there is more vigour in his assault. In vers. 4-9 he directly charges Job with a number of specified sins, and in vers. 10, 11 declares his sufferings to be the consequence of them. He then proceeds to accuse him of denying God's omniscience (vers. 12-14), and, alter some not very successful attempts to retort on him his own words (vers. 15-20), finally recurs to his favourite devices (see Job 5:17-26) of exhorting Job to submission and repentance, and promising him restoration to God's favour and a return of prosperity (vers. 21-30). Verses 1, 2. - Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, Can a man be profitable unto God? Job had said nothing upon this point; but perhaps Eliphaz thinks his complaints and expostulations to imply a higher value in man, and a greater claim to consideration at God's hands, than can rightly be challenged. Certainly God does not depend on man for profit or advantage of any kind. Neither our wisdom nor our goodness \"extendeth to him.\" As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself; rather, truly he that is wise is profitable unto himself; i.e. to himself only, and not to God. Man's intelligence and researches can add nothing to God's knowledge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? As \"our goodness extendeth not to God,\" and as his all-perfect happiness knows neither increase nor diminution, we cannot he said to advantage him by our goodness. Still \"good works, which are the fruits of faith, and follow after justification, are pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ;\" and God himself condescends to say that he \"takes pleasure in his people,\" \"in them that fear him\" (Psalm 147:11; Psalm 149:4). Or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect? Of course, the \"gain\" is to the man himself, and not to God. He saves his soul alive. God has one more worshipper in the courts of heaven, one more voice added to the choir which hymns his praise for evermore, But what is one drop added to an ocean?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? rather, Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee? Surely not. If he reproves thee, it must be because thou fearest him not. The fact of thy reproof is sure evidence of the fact of thy guilt. Will he enter with thee into judgment? rather, that he entereth with thee into judgment (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Is not thy wickedness great? Judging from the greatness of Job's punishment, Eliphaz concludes, logically from his premisses, that his wickedness must be commensurate. He must have been guilty of almost every form of ill-doing. And thine iniquities infinite? literally, and is there not no end to thine iniquities? These general conclusions seem to Eliphaz to justify him in proceeding to the enumeration of details.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought; i.e. thou hast lent to thy brother on pledge, without reasonable cause, when thou weft rich enough to need no security (comp. Nehemiah 5:2-11). And stripped the naked of their clothing. When thy brother, on borrowing from thee, pledged his raiment, thou didst retain it, and so didst leave him to shiver all night without covering (see Exodus 22:26, 27). We may, perhaps, gather from this that the Mosaic Law on the subject was founded on an anterior custom widely prevalent in SouthWestern Asia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink. To give water to the thirsty was regarded in the East as one of the most elementary duties of man to man. The self-justification of the dead in the Egyptian Hades contained the following passage: \"I gave my bread to the hungry, and drink to him that was athirst; I clothed the naked with garments; I sheltered the wanderer\" ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. CXXV. § 38). The same claim appears continually on Egyptian tombs. \"All men respected me,\" we read on one; \"I gave water to the thirsty; I set the wanderer in his path; I took away the oppressor, and put a stop to violence\" ('Non-Biblical Systems of Religion,' p. 46). In the proverbs assigned to Solomon, \"which the men of Hezekiah copied out\" (Proverbs 25:1), the duty was declared to be one owed even to enemies (see Proverbs 25:21, \"If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink\"). Isaiah notices it as praiseworthy in the Temanites (Eliphaz's people), that they \"brought water to him that was thirsty and prevented with their bread him that fled\" (Isaiah 21:14). Jael is praised for going further than this: He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish\" (Judges 5:25). And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. Later on Job absolutely denies this, as well as many of the other charges. \"If I have withheld,\" he says, \"the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof,\" then let mine arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone\" (Job 31:16-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; literally, as for the man of arm; i.e. the man strong of arm. Job's retainers are probably meant, whom Eliphaz supposes to have been allowed by Job to oppress the poor, and have their own way in the world. This charge was doubtless as baseless as the others (comp. Job 29:16, 17). And the honourable man dwelt in it; of the accepted man - \"the favoured man,\" i.e. those of whom Job approved and whom he favoured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou hast sent widows away empty. Job, on the contrary, declares that he \"caused the widow s heart to sing for joy\" (Job 29:13). The sin of oppressing widows was one of which Job deeply felt the heinousness. He is certainly a priori not likely to have committed it (Job 1:1; Job 4:3, 4), and the prejudiced testimony of Eliphaz will scarcely convince any dispassionate person to the contrary. And the arms of the fatherless have been broken; i.e. the strength of the fatherless has been (by thy fault) taken flora them. Job has allowed them to be oppressed and ruined. The reply of Job is, \"When the ear heard, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw, it gave witness to me: because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him\" (Job 29:11, 12; see also Job 31:21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Therefore snares are round about thee. As Bildad had threatened (Job 18:8-10), and as Job himself had acknowledged (Job 19:6). And sudden fear troubleth thee (comp. Job 3:25; Job 7:14; Job 13:21, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Or darkness, that thou canst not see. Job had complained of the \"darkness\" that was \"set in his paths\" (Job 19:8), meaning probably his inability to discover the cause of his afflictions. And abundance of waters cover thee. The comparison of severe affliction to an overwhelming flood is very common in Scripture (see Psalm 42:7; Psalm 69:1-3, 14, 15; Psalm 124:4, 5; Lamentations 3:54, etc.). So Shakespeare speaks of \"a sea of troubles.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Is not God in the height of heaven? From taxing Job with definite open sins, Eliphaz proceeds to accuse him of impious thoughts and principles. He does not acknowledge, Eliphaz says, either the majesty or the omniscience of God. Here he has, at any rate, some tangible ground for his reproaches. Job's words have been over-bold, over-venturesome. He has seemed to forget the distance between God and man (Job 9:30-33; Job 10:2, 3; Job 13:3, etc.), and to call in question either God's omniscience or his regard for moral distinctions (Job 9:22, 23; Job 21:7-13, 23-26). Hence Eliphaz is enabled to take a high tone and ask, \"Hast thou forgotten that God is in the height of heaven, far up above all us poor wretched mortals? Dost thou need to be reminded of this? He is above the stars, and yet behold the height of the stars, how high they are! Even they are infinitely above men, yet how far below him!\" (comp. Job 35:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And thou sayest, How doth God know? Job had not said this in so many words, but, by equalizing the godly and the wicked (Job 9:22; Job 21:23-26), he might be supposed to mean that God took no note of men's conduct, and therefore had not a perfect knowledge of all things. The psalmist implies that many men so thought (Psalm 10:11; Psalm 73:11; Psalm 94:7). Can he judge through the dark cloud? rather, through the thick darkness. God was supposed to dwell remote from man, in the highest heaven, and, according to many, \"clouds and darkness were round about him\" (Psalm 97:2) - he \"dwelt in the thick darkness\" (1 Kings 8:12) - he \"made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him was waters, and thick clouds of the skies\" (Psalm 18:11). The imagery was, no doubt, at first used in reference to man's inability to see and know God; but when men became familiar with it, they turned the metaphor round, and questioned God's ability to see and know anything about man. Job had not really ever shared in these doubts; but it suits Eliphaz's purpose to malign and misrepresent him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not (see the comment on the preceding verse); and he walketh in the circuit of heaven; or, on the circumference of the heavens. The heavens are regarded as a solid vault, outside which is the place where God dwells.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? rather, Wilt thou keep the old way etc.? (see the Revised Version). Eliphaz assumes that it is Job's intention to cast in his lot with these persons whose prosperous wickedness he has described in the preceding chapter (vers. 7-15). And this notwithstanding Job's final protest, \"Be the counsel of the wicked far from me\" (ver. 16). He calls the mode of life pursued by these wicked persons \"the old way,\" either with allusion to the seed of Cain before the Flood, who \"corrupted their way\" (Genesis 6:12), or perhaps with reference to the descendants of Nimrod after it (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' p. 361).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Which were cut down (rather, swept or snatched away) out of time; i.e. before their time, prematurely. Whose foundation was overflown with a flood. Some suppose an allusion to the general destruction of mankind by the Noachian Deluge; but perhaps no more is meant than that the supports of the wicked are ordinarily loosened and carried away by a flood of calamity. No single event need be referred to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Who said unto God, Depart from us (comp. Job 21:14). Eliphaz tries, though with no very great success, to turn Job's words against him. And, What can the Almighty do for them? i.e. and ask what the Almighty can do for them. A change from the second to the third person, without any change of subject, is not unusual in Hebrew. The wicked renounce God, and bid him depart from them - conduct which they justify by asking what good he could do them if they acted otherwise. The idea is the same as that of Job 21:15, though not expressed so pointedly. What Eliphaz thinks to gain by echoing Job's words is not very apparent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Yet he filled their houses with good things. The \"he\" is emphatic (הוּא). Translate, Yet it was he that filled their houses with good things; and comp. Job 21:16, where the prosperity of the wicked is said not to have proceeded from themselves. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me; or, but let the counsel of the wicked be far from me. Again, Job's words in Job 21:16 are echoed, perhaps that Eliphaz may show himself to be at least as pious as Job.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The righteous see it, and are glad; i.e. \"the righteous see both the short-lived prosperity (ver. 18) and the ultimate destruction (ver. 16) of the wicked, and rejoice over them. especially over the latter\" (comp. Psalm 58:10; Psalm 107:40-42; Proverbs 11:10). And the innocent laugh them to scorn (comp. Psalm 2:6). Scorn and derision are the just portion of the wicked, and in Old Testament times even saints did not scruple to pour them out on those who deserved them. But the gospel spirit is different.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Whereas our substance is not cut down. It is best to take these as the words of the righteous in their triumph over the wicked; but they can scarcely bear the interpretation given them in the Authorized Version. The clause is not really negative but affirmative, and the word קִים. does not mean \"substance,\" but \"adversary.\" Translate, Surely they that rose up against us (or, our adversaries) are cut off; and compare the Revised Version. The \"adversaries\" of the righteous are the \"wicked men\" who have been \"snatched away before their time,\" and have had their \"foundation overflown with a flood\" (ver. 16). But the remnant of them the fire consumeth; rather, and the remnant of them hath the fire consumed (see the Revised Version). The \"fire\" here, like the \"flood\" in ver. 16, is a metaphor, and therefore not to be pressed. All that is essential is that the wicked are destroyed. Over this the \"righteous\" and the \"innocent\" rejoice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAcquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-30. - At this point a transition occurs. Eliphaz turns away from reproaches, open or covert, designed to exhibit Job as an example of extreme wickedness, and falls back on those topics which were the main subjects of his first exhortation (Job 5:8-27), viz. an earnest appeal to Job to return to God, to repent and amend (vers. 21-23) and a lavish outpouring of promises, or prophecies, that in that case he should be delivered from all his troubles, should recover his wealth and prosperity, obtain of God all that he should pray for, succeed in all his enterprises, and be able to help and ease others, even those who might be guilty in God's sight (vers. 24-30). Verse 21. - Acquaint now thyself with him (i.e. God), and be at peace; or, make, I beseech thee a trial of him, and be at peace; i.e. risk everything, throw thyself upon his mercy, and so make thy peace with him. To do so is well worth thy while, for thereby good shall come unto thee. It is a question what sort of \"good\" is meant. If we are to explain the \"good\" of this passage by vers. 24, 25 exclusively, Eliphaz will become a mere utilitarian, and he will be rightly characterized as \"selfish and sordid\" (Cook) - an anticipation of the Mammon of Milton. But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for singling out vers. 24, 25 from the rest of the passage, and regarding them as forming its key-note. The \"good\" which Eliphaz promises to Job includes, besides \"the gold of Ophir\" and \"plenty of silver,\" such things as \"delight in the Almighty,\" and confident trust in him (ver. 26), God's hearing of his prayers (ver. 27), the shining of light upon his path (ver. 28), his own payment of his vows (ver. 27), his giving assistance to the poor and needy (ver. 29), and even his deliverance of the guilty by the pureness of his hands (ver. 30); so that other besides material considerations are clearly taken into account, and the worldly prosperity which Eliphaz promises forms a part only of the good result which he anticipates from the patriarch making his peace with the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReceive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth; or, receive now instruction from his mouth. The supposition of some commentators, that the \"Law of Moses\" is intended, is negatived by the entire absence from the Book of any allusion to the details of the Mosaic legislation, as well as by the primitive character of the life depicted in the book, and the certainty that no one of the interlocutors is an Israelite. The Hebrew תּורה, without the article prefixed, is properly \"instruction,\" and is only to be assumed as meaning \"the Law\" when the context shows this meaning to be probable. The \"instruction\" to which Eliphaz here points, and which he regards as instruction from God's mouth, is probably the teaching of religious men, such as himself, which he considered to have come from God originally, though, perhaps, he could not have explained how. And lay up his words in thine heart. This is a mere variant of the preceding clause, and adds no fresh idea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - If thou shalt return to the Almighty. Eliphaz, like Bildad in Job 8:5, and Zophar in Job 11:13, taxes Job with having fallen away from God, almost with having apostatized. All his prophecies of future prosperity rest upon the assumption that Job, having fallen away, is now about to turn to God, repent of his misdoings, and be again received with favour. Thou shall be built up; i.e. \"restored, re-established! Thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles (comp.

And the gold of Ophir (literally, and Ophir) shall be to thee as the stones of the brooks, (comp. 2 Chronicles 9:27, \"And the king [i.e. Solomon] made silver in Jerusalem as stones\"). \"Ophir\" stands, no doubt, for untold wealth, being the great gold- producing country (see 1 Kings 9:28; 1 Kings 10:11; 1 Kings 22:48; 1 Chronicles 29:41; Psalm 45:9; Isaiah 13:12). (On its location, see the article on \"Ophir,\" in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol 2. pp. 637-652, and compare the comment on Job 28:16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense; rather, thy treasure. The word is the same as that used in the first clause of ver. 24, It properly signifies \"ore.\" The general meaning of the passage seems to be, \"However rich thou mayest be in the precious metals, thy true treasure - that which thou wilt value most - will be the Almighty himself.\" And thou shalt have plenty of silver; or, and he shall be previous silver unto thee (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty. God shall no longer be a terror and alarm to thee, as he is at present (Job 7:17-20; Job 9:17, 34; Job 10:15-17; Job 13:21; Job 19:6-13, etc.), but a source of rejoicing and joy. Thou shalt have blessings at his hands instead of sufferings, rewards instead of punishments. Therefore shalt thou delight in him, and shalt lift up thy rites unto God; i.e. \"shalt turn towards him, like the sunflower towards the sun, end bask in the light of his countenance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee. Now Job prays, but is not heard; he asks for death, but it does not come; he begs for a respite from suffering, but it is refused him; he beseeches God to enter into argument with him (Job 9:32-34; Job 10:2), but God vouchsafes no answer. Let him follow Eliphaz's advice, \"return to the Almighty\" (ver. 23), humble himself in the dust, repent and \"put away his iniquity\" (ver. 23), and then, Eliphaz promises him, all shall be changed - God will become gracious to him, will listen to him, and grant his requests, will remove his heavy hand, and crown him with mercy and loving-kindness. Then, he adds, thou shalt pay thy vows. Thou shalt have wealth enough, and strength enough, to pay any vows that thou hast made, which now in thy afflicted state thou canst not do. Vows are part of natural religion, and were widely prevalent over all the East in ancient times. The performance of vows, which was strictly enjoined in the Mosaic Law (Deuteronomy 23:21), must at all times have been felt as obligatory by the natural conscience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee. Whatever thou resolvest on, i.e., God shall ratify with his authority, and bring to pass in due time for thy benefit - a promise which has certainly \"a touch of audacity\" about it (Cook). David is less bold, but intends to give the same sort of encouragement when he says, \"Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart; commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass (Psalm 37:4, 5). And the light shall shine upon thy ways. Job had complained of the \"darkness\" by which his path was shadowed (Job 19:8). Eliphaz promises that this cause of complaint shall be removed. Job's way shall be \"made plain before his face.\" A bright light shall illumine it - a light that shall ever \"shine more and more unto the perfect day\" (Proverbs 4:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29.- When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; rather, when men cast down and thou shalt say, Let there be lifting upJob 22:30NEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - He shall deliver the island of the innocent; rather, he shall deliver even him that is not innocent (see the Revised Version). It is now generally admitted that אי in this place is for אין, as in 1 Samuel 4:21; Proverbs 31:4. The meaning seems to be that God will deliver, at Job's prayer, even guilty persons, who will be delivered by the pureness of Job's hands. Eliphaz thus prophesies his own deliverance and that of his two friends from God's wrath at the intercession of Job, as actually came to pass afterwards (see Job 42:7-9).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-24:25. - Job replies to Eliphaz in a speech of no great length, which, though it occupies two chapters, runs to only forty-two verses. He begins by justifying the vehemence of his complaints, first, on the ground of the severity of his sufferings (ver. 2), and secondly, on the ground of his conviction that, if God would bring him to an open trial before his tribunal, he would acquit him (vers. 3-12). By the way, he complains that God hides himself, and cannot be found (vers. 3, 8, 9). He then further complains that God is not to be bent from his purpose, which is set against Job (vers. 13-17). In ch. 24. he goes over ground already trodden, maintaining the general prosperity of the wicked, and their exemption from any special earthly punishment (vers. 2-24). He winds up, finally, with a challenge to his opponents to disprove the truth of what he has said (ver. 25). Verses 1, 2. - Then Job answered and said, Even to-day is my complaint bitter; i.e. even to-day, notwithstanding all that has been said by my opponents against my right to complain, I do complain, and as bitterly as ever. And I justify my complaint on the following ground - my stroke is heavier than my groaning. If I complain bitterly, I suffer even more bitterly (comp. Job 6:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Oh that I knew where I might find him! This is the cry of the desolate human soul, feeling its need of God, and yet not knowing how to approach him. God seems to be very far removed from us. He is in heaven, and we are on earth; nay, he is in the highest heaven, or outside it, walking on its circumference (Job 22:14). How are we to approach near to him, so near as to be sure that he can hear us? How are we to \"find\" him? So, in all ages, has the human heart gone out to God, aspiring towards him, seeking after him, but, for the most part, baffled and disappointed. Job, like most other men in the olden times, though he has faith in God, though he serves him and prays to him, has yet the feeling that he is remote, distant, well-nigh inaccessible. It needed revelation to let man know that God is not far off, but very near to each one of us; that \"in him we live, and move, and have our being\" (Acts 17:28). That I might come even to his seat! Job's idea of bridging the distance between himself and God is that he should rise to the region where God is, not that God should condescend to come down to him. He wishes to \"come to God's seat\" - to that awful throne in the heaven of heavens, where God sitteth, surrounded by his hosts of angels, dealing out justice and judgment to mortal men (comp. Psalm 9:4, 7; Psalm 11:4; Psalm 45:6; Isaiah 6:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I would order my cause before him. Job has put away the feelings of shame and diffidence, which were predominant with him when he said, \"How should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand\" (Job 9:2, 3); and again, \"How much less shall I answer him, and cheese out my words to reason with him? Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; but I would make my supplication to my Judge\" (Job 9:14, 15). He now wishes to contend and argue and reason. This is quite in accordance with our experience. Many am the moods of man - various and conflicting his desires! His mind never continues long in one stay. And fill my mouth with arguments (comp. Psalm 38:14, where our translators render the same word by \"reproofs,\" but where \"arguments\" or \"pleadings\" would be more appropriate). The LXX. has there ἐλεγμοὶ, and in the present passage ἔλεγχοι. The word is forensic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I would know the words which he would answer me. It would be a satisfaction to Job in his present mood to know exactly how God would answer him, what reply he would make to his \"arguments.\" The tone of thought is too bold for a creature, and would certainly not be becoming in Christians. And understand what he would say unto me. Here we have another of the redundant second clauses, which merely echo the idea contained in the previous clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Will he plead against me with his great power? rather, Would he contend against me in the greatness of his power? (see the Revised Version). Flint is, \"Would he crush me by mere strength and force? Would he use against me that overwhelming might which he possesses? No, Job answers, certainly not; but he would put strength in me; or, rather, but he would give heed to me he would pay attention to my cause (comp. Job 4:20, ad fin., where the same verb is used).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There the righteous might dispute with him. There, before his high tribunal (ver. 3), the upright man (ישׁר) might argue or reason with him, appealing from his justice to his mercy - from God the Judge to God the Saviour (Loathes), vindicating his integrity, acknowledging his transgressions, and pleading that they were sins of infirmity-and at last obtaining from God the acquittal anticipated in the second clause of the verse. In the absence of any revelation of an Advocate who will plead our cause before God for us, Job would seem to have been justified in expecting such a liberty of pleading his own cause as he here sets forth. So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge. The \"Judge of all the earth\" will certainly and necessarily \"do right.\" Job's conscience testifies to his substantial integrity and uprightness (comp. 1 John 3:21). He is, therefore, confident that, if he can once bring his cause to God's cognizance, he will obtain acquittal and deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - Here Job returns to the complaint of ver. 3. He cannot \"find\" God. God hides himself. It is in vain that he searches on every side. There is no manifestation, no open vision. Nothing, however, leads him to doubt God's existence, or even his presence where he is unperceived. \"Job's conviction of God's absolute presence comes out most strongly when he feels that he cannot discern him\" (Cook). Verse 8. - Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; that is, \"He is not there to my perceptions.\" I may believe it, but I have no sensible proof of it, and I cannot demonstrate it. And backward, but I cannot perceive him. In describing locality, the Hebrews, Arabs, and Orientals generally always imagined themselves to be looking eastward, facing the rising sun. Hence the same word is used for\" in front,\" \"forwards,\" and \"the east;\" for \"behind,\" \"backwards,\" and \"the west;\" for \"the left hand\" and \"the north;\" for \"the right hand\" and \"the south.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - On the left hand, where he doth work; literally, in his workshop. There is an ellipse after \"workshop\" of some phrase like \"I look for him.\" But I cannot behold him; rather, but I apprehend him not - I cannot as it were, lay my hand upon him (LXX., οὐ κάτεσχον). He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him; literally, and I do not see him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But he knoweth the way that I take; or, the way that is with me. My inability to find God does not in any way interfere with his perfect knowledge of me. God knows both \"the way of the righteous\" (Psalm 1:6) \"and \"the way of the wicked,\" which\" he turns upside down \"(Psalm 146:9). He is \"about our path, and about our bed, and spieth out all our ways\" (Psalm 139:2). When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold; i.e. as gold from the furnace, I shall come forth purified, when my trial is over (comp. Psalm 12:6; Isaiah 1:25; Jeremiah 6:29, 30; Jeremiah 9:7, etc.). Job seems at last to have woke up to the conception that there is a purifying power in affliction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My foot hath held his steps; rather, hath held dose to his steps, or his path; i.e. I have followed in God's way, and kept as close to it as possible. In other words. I have kept his way, and not declined from it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips. Professor Lee rightly observes that this declaration \"takes it for granted that, at least, some precepts of God had been revealed before this time\" ('Book of Job,' p. 370). Them were \"commandments\" which Job recognized as having proceeded from God, and \"words\" which he looked upon as being the utterances of his mouth. This is strong evidence of a primeval revelation which, if not reduced to writing, had, at any rate, been handed down by tradition to Job's day. Genesis 3:14-19 and Genesis 9:1-7 may afford the true explanation of this difficulty. I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. This is scarcely strong enough. Job says, \"I have treasured up taken to myself, and preserved the words of his mouth,\" either \"more than my necessary food\" or \"more than my own law.\" If the former rendering be preferred, there is no need of explanation; if the latter, we must regard \"my own law\" as meaning \"the law of my own mind, my own will, the will of the natural man\" (Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? Once more we hear the voice of complaint. The happier tone of thought which extends from ver. 6 to ver. 12 grows out of a sanguine hope on Job's part that God will bring him before his tribunal, and judge his cause according to righteousness. Now he bethinks himself that hitherto God, notwithstanding his prayers, has refused to summon him to his judgment-seat, and begins to fear that there is no likelihood of his changing. \"He is One,\" or \"in one.\" With him is \"no variableness, neither shadow of turning\" (James 1:17). How is it likely that he will act in the future otherwise than he has acts! in the past? What his soul desireth, even that he doeth. A somewhat harsh way of saying that God doeth that which seemeth him best - and which, therefore, is best. Job does not really suppose that God is actuated by caprice or favouritism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me; i.e he will assuredly accomplish whatever he has decreed for me. I cannot expect that he will blench or change. And many such things are with him. He has many other weapons in his armoury, many other woes with which he might afflict me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Therefore am I troubled at his presence. The thought of these further afflictions troubles me, and makes me shrink from his unseen presence. I know not how soon he may lay a fresh burden upon me. When I consider, I am afraid of him. When I reflect on the many forms of suffering which I may still have to undergo, my fears increase, I tremble at the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For God maketh my heart soft; of faint as in Leviticus 26:36 and Deuteronomy 20:3. He takes away my courage, and leaves me a prey to terror. And the Almighty troubleth me. The verb used (the hiph. form of בהל) is a very strong one, and means \"hath filled me with horror and consternation?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. Job complains of two things:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That he was not cut off (i.e. removed from earth) before the great darkness fell upon his life (comp. Job 3:11-13).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That he was not \"covered,' i.e. sheltered and protected, by the love and care of God when the dark days came.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Why, seeing times are not hidden from the almighty. By \"times\" seem to be meant God's special periods of exhibiting himself in action as the moral Governor of the world, vindicating the righteous, and taking vengeance upon sinners. Such \"times\" are frequently spoken of in the prophetical Scriptures as \"days of the Lord\" (see Isaiah 2:12; Isaiah 3:18; Isaiah 4:1; Isaiah 13:6, 9; Joel 1:15; Joel 2:1, 11; Obadiah 1:15; Zephaniah 1:7, 14, etc.). They are, of course, \"not hidden\" from him, seeing that it is he who determines on them beforehand, and, when their fixed date is come, makes them special \"days,\" or \"times,\" different from all others. Do they who know him not see his days? i.e. why are even they, who know and serve God, kept in the dark as to these \"times,\" so that they do not foresee them or know when they are coming? This is to Job a great perplexity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSome remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Some remove the landmarks. (On this form of wickedness, see Deuteronomy 19:14; Deuteronomy 27:17; Proverbs 22:28; Proverbs 23:10; Hosea 5:10.) Where neighbouring properties are not divided by fences of any kind, as in the East generally, the only way of distinguishing between one man's land and another's is by termini, or \"landmarks,\" which are generally low stone metes or bourns, placed at intervals on the boundary-line. An easy form of robbery was to displace these bourns, putting them further back on one's neighbour's land. They violently take away flocks. Others openly drive off their neighbours' flocks from their pastures, mix them with their own flocks, and say that they are theirs (comp. Job 1:15-17). And feed thereof; rather, and feed them (as in the margin); i.e. pasture them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3 - They drive away the ass of the fatherless. This was another form of oppression. \"Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed?\" says Samuel, on laying down his judgeship (1 Samuel 12:3). The \"fatherless\" were particularly liable to such ill treatment, seeing that they had lost their natural protector. They take the widow's ox for a pledge. It may be true that this was nowhere a legal offence, not even among the Hebrews (Lee); but it was a real act of oppression, and forms a fitting counterpart to the injury done to the orphan. (On the natural tendency of selfish men to bear hard on these two classes, see Exodus 22:22; Deuteronomy 24:17; Deuteronomy 27:19; Psalm 94:6; Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 10:2; Jeremiah 5:28; Zechariah 7:10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They turn the needy out of the way. Either \"they force poor men to turn out of the road when they are using it, and wait till they have passed\" (compare the recent practice of the Japanese daimios), or \"they make the highways so dangerous with their violence that they compel the poor and needy to seek byways for safety\" (Judges 5:6). The second hemistich favours the latter interpretation. The poor of the earth (or, the meek of the earth) hide themselves together. In the East there have always been superior and subject races, as well as proud nobles and down-trodden men of the same race. It is not clear of which of these two Job speaks. The former were often hunted out of all the desirable lands, and forced to fly to rooks and caves and holes in the ground, whence they were known as \"Troglodytes.\" The latter, less frequently, handed together, and withdrew to remote and sequestered spots, where they might hope to live unmolested by their oppressors (Hebrews 11:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work. Plundering bands of wicked marauders scour the desert, like troops of wild asses, going forth early to their work, and late taking rest - rising betimes for a prey, and generally finding it, since the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. They are sure to find some plunder or other ere the day is over.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They reap every one his corn in the field. When they have scoured the desert, the marauders approach the cultivated ground bordering on it, and thence carry off, each of them. a quantity of \"fodder,\" or \"provender\" (Revised Version), for the sustentation of their horses. And they gather the vintage of the wicked; rather, as in the margin, and the wicked gather the vintage. (So Rosenmuller and Professor Lee.) Sometimes they burst into the vineyards, and rob them, carrying off the ripe grapes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They cause the naked to lodge without clothing; rather, they lie all night naked, without clothing. The marauders are still the subject of the narrative. When engaged in their raids, they endure to pass the night without clothing, as the Bedouins are said to do to this day, so that they have no covering in the cold. They are so bent upon plunder that they do not mind these inconveniences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. Further unpleasant consequences of marauding, but endured without complaint by the wild robber-tribes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They pluck the fatherless from the breast. Other oppressors, not of the marauding class, but dwellers in towns (ver. 12), are so cruel that they tear the unweaned child of the debtor from the mother's breast, as satisfaction for a debt, and carry him off into slavery (comp. 2 Kings 4:1; Nehemiah 5:5). And take a pledge of the poor; literally, take in pledge that which is on the poor - in other words, their clothing. They will not lend to them on any other terms, and so force them to part with their garments, and go about naked. Even Hebrew creditors seem to have done this (Exodus 22:26; Deuteronomy 24:12, 13); and the Mosaic Law did not forbid the practice, but only required the creditor to let the debtor have his garment at night, that he might sleep in it (Exodus 22:27; Deuteronomy 24:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They cause him to go naked without clothing; rather, they go naked without clothing. The effects of the oppression on its victims are now traced. First of all, the poor man, whose only wrap or cloak has been taken in pledge, is com-polled to go naked, or almost naked, both day and night, exposed alike to extremes of heat and cold. Secondly, he is compelled to reap and bind and carry home the sheaves of his oppressor, while he himself is half famished with hunger. The second clause of the verse is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, where we read, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; the real meaning being, \"and they who are an hungered, carry the sheaves\" (compare the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Which make oil within their walls, and tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst. In the third place, the same unfortunates are employed in the homesteads of their oppressors to express oil from the olives and wine from the rich clusters of grapes, while they themselves are tormented with unceasing thirst.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Men groan from out of the city. It is not only in the wild tracts bordering on the desert (vers. 5-8), or on the large farms of rich landholders (vers. 9-11), that oppression takes place. Men's groans are heard also \"from the city,\" and in the midst of the city, where murder, robbery, burglary, adultery, and other crimes of the deepest dye abound. Then the soul of the wounded crieth out. In appeals to God for help, or in inarticulate cries, the wounded spirit of the oppressed and injured vents itself. Yet God layeth not folly to them. Yet God seems to take no notice. He gives no sign of disapproval, but allows the oppressors to go on in their foolish courses unchecked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They are of those who rebel against the light. These city oppressors go beyond the others in entirely rejecting the light of reason, conscience, and law. They threw off every restraint. The \"light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" is nothing to them. They know not the ways thereof. They will not know, will not have anything to do with, the law of moral restraint - much less will they abide in the paths thereof; i.e. acknowledge and be guided by such restraints continually. On the contrary,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy. The murderer rises at the first glimpse of dawn - the time when mast men sleep most soundly. He cannot go about his wicked business in complete darkness. He has not the courage to attack the great and powerful, who might be well armed and have retainers to defend them, but enters the houses of a comparatively poor class, in which he is less afraid to risk himself. Here, in the night he is as a thief. He has not come into the house simply for murder. Theft is his main object. He will not take life unless he is resisted or discovered, and so, in a certain sense, driven to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me. There is an analogy between moral and physical light, and between moral and physical darkness. The class of men here spoken of (vers. 14-16), who have rebelled against moral light (ver. 13), and refused its ways, and rejected its paths, are no great lovers of physical light. Their deeds of darkness are only suited to be done in the dark, and they wait for the evening twilight or the dusk of dawn to engage in them (comp. John 3:19-21, \"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\" See also John 8:12; John 12:35; Romans 13:12; Ephesians 5:8-14, etc.). And he disguiseth his face. As a further precaution against discovery, the adulterer disguiseth, or covereth up, his face. The same is often done by thieves and murderers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - In the dark they dig through houses. In ancient times, burglary commonly took this form. Windows were few, and high up in the walls; doors were strongly fastened with bolts and bars. But the walls, being of clay, or rubble, or sun-dried brick, were weak and easily penetrable. This was especially the case with party walls; and if burglars entered an unoccupied house, nothing was easier than to break through the slight partition which separated it from the house next door. The Greek word for \"burglar\" is τοιχώρυχος\" he who digs through a wall.\" Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime; rather, they shut themselves up in the daytime; literally, they seal themselves up; the meaning being that they carefully keep themselves close. Professor Lee, however, defends the Authorized Version. They know not the light; i.e. they avoid it, keep away from it, will have nothing to do with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death. They hate the morning light. It is associated in their minds with the idea of detection; for when it breaks in upon them unexpectedly in the midst of their ill deeds, detection commonly follows; and detection is a true \"shadow of death,\" for it commonly means the gallows. If one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death; rather, for they know the terrors of the shadow of death (see the Revised Version). It is a familiar experience to them; as, whenever crime is severely punished, it is to the criminal class generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He is swift as the waters. \"Locus obscurissimus\" (Schulteus). Scarcely any two commentators agree even as to the subject on which Job proceeds to speak. Some regard him as giving his own judgment on the ultimate fate of the wicked; others, as anticipating what his opponents will say on the point. One recent expositor takes the passage as referring to the efforts made by the malefactors of vers. 14-16 to escape from justice, and to the discredit and difficulty in which they involve themselves. Another suggests that Job here calls attention to a fresh class of oppressors, viz. water-thieves (see Strabo, 16:18), who, starting in light boats from some island in a lake or river, plundered the neighbouring lands, making the portions of the landholders worthless, and causing them to neglect the cultivation, even of their vineyards. If we accept this view, the proper translation of the present verse will be, Swift is he (i.e. the water-thief) upon the face of the waters: then is the portion of them who dwell in the land worthless; no one turneth his face toward his vine. yards (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' pp. 153, 378, 379).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDrought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so doth the grave those which have sinned. This rendering is further confirmed by the next verse. Accepting it, we must suppose Job to pass at this point to the consideration of the ultimate end of the wicked, though in ver. 21 he returns to the consideration of their ill doings. The heat and drought of summer, he says, consume and dry up all the water which comes from the melting of the winter's snows. So does Shoel, or the grave, absorb, and as it were consume, the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The womb shall forget him: Some regard this as equivalent to \"Earth shall forget him;\" but most suppose \"the womb\" to mean \"his own mother.\" The worm shall feed sweetly on him (comp. Job 17:14). He shall be no more remembered. Oblivion shall fall upon him and his doings. And wickedness shall be broken as a tree. As a strong wind suddenly snaps off a tree at the root, so wickedness, in the person of the wicked man - the abstract for the concrete - shall be overtaken by death, and perish in a moment (comp. ver. 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not. Oppressors of another class are perhaps here spoken of, or perhaps there is a mere return to the idea with which Job's enumeration opened (ver. 3), which was the oppression of the weaker and more defenceless classes. As barrenness in women was considered the greatest possible misfortune (1 Samuel 1:5-8; 1 Samuel 3:1-10), so oppressing one that was barren indicated extreme cruelty. And doeth not good to the widow; i.e. neglects to vindicate her cause - an admitted part of man's duty (see Job 22:9; Job 29:13; Job 31:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He draweth also the mighty with his power; i.e. he draws to his side, and makes his helpers, those who are mighty, attracting them or compelling them to join him by the power which he already has. He riseth up, and no man is sure of life. This is also the translation of the Revised Version. Some commentators, however, prefer to render, \"He riseth up, when he has despaired of life; \"i.e. the wicked man, when he has been brought into trouble, either sickness or danger of death at the hands of Justice, to men's surprise, \"riseth up\" - is delivered from the danger, and recovers his prosperity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; rather, he (i.e. God) granteth him to be in security and thereon he resteth; i.e. God allows the escape of the wicked man from his trouble, and lets him live on, safe and secure, and the man himself rests on the security thus afforded him, quite contented with it. Yet his eyes are upon their ways. God's eyes are still upon the ways of the wicked: they are, or seem to be, the objects of a special providential care.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; rather, they are exalted: after a little while they are gone they are brought low. Job has to admit that death comes upon wicked men at last; but he minimizes the terrors of their death, and exaggerates its alleviations. First, it comes on them when they have risen to eminence, have gained themselves a reputation, and \"are exalted.\" Next, it is sudden and painless, preceded by no long, lingering illness, but just a sinking into non-existence; a tranquil passing away. Thirdly, it is at a ripe age, when they have reached the full term of human life, and are as ears of corn ripe for the harvest. Further, it is the common fate: They are taken out of the way as all other (comp. Job 9:22; Job 21:13), and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. We may gather from this expression that the reaping in the land of Uz was conducted in Job's time much in the same way as it was in Egypt under the early Pharaohs, viz. by cutting the stalk with a sharp sickle almost immediately below the ear, and collecting the ears in baskets (see the author's 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 162; and his 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 59, 3rd edit.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And if it be not so now; i.e. \"if these things be not as I say.\" Who will make me a liar?

Bildad, in his weak reply, entirely avoids the subject, and limits himself to briefly touching two old and well-worn topics - the might of God (vers. 2, 3) and the universal sinfulness of men. On neither of these two points does he throw any fresh light. He avoids, however, the reckless charges of Eliphaz (Job 22:5-9) as well as the coarse menaces of Zophar (Job 20:5-29). Verses 1, 2. - Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, Dominion and fear are with him (i.e. with God). God is the absolute Sovereign of the universe, to whom, therefore, all created beings must perforce submit themselves. He is also terrible in his might, so that for their own sakes men should submit to his decrees. Through his active sovereignty, and the fear which he inspires, he maketh peace in his high places. The meaning may be that, through these high attributes, God maintains peace among the dwellers in the supernal regions; but beyond this there is a possible allusion to a time in which peace was disturbed, and the Almighty had to \"make\" it, or re-establish it, (On the subject of the \"war in heaven,\" and the defeat and subjection of the rebels, see the comment on Job 9:13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Is there any number of his armies?

The number of the angels at any given time must be a definite one. But as there is nothing to limit the further exercise of creative power in this direction, the possible number is indefinite. And upon whom doth not his light arise? Upon what being among all the countless thousands whom he hath created, or will create, does not the brightness of his effulgence shine in such sort that they are illumined by him, and them° selves shine with a mere reflected splendour?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - How then can man be justified with God? If God's creatures have no brightness of their own, and, when they shine, shine only with a reflected radiance, then certainly can no man be justified by his own merits. \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23).

(comp. Psalm 22:6). How much less can man be pure in God's sight? An undoubted truth, or rather, perhaps, a truism, but not to the point, for Job has never really maintained that he is without sin (see ch. 7:20, 21; 9:2, 20, etc.). He has only maintained that his sins have not been of such a character as to account for his sufferings.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - But Job answered and said, How hast thou helped him that is without power?

As Bildad seemed to have supposed that he needed enlightenment on these points (Job 26:2-4), Job may have thought it right to make once more a plain profession of his belief (comp. Job 9:4-18; Job 12:9-25, etc.). Verse 5. - Dead things are formed from under the waters; rather, the dead from under the waters tremble. Hehraists generally are agreed that one of the meanings of Rephaim (רְפָאִים) is \"the dead\" or the departed, considered especially as inhabitants of Hades (comp. Psalm 88:11; Proverbs 2:18; Isaiah 14:9; Isaiah 26:14). And if so, this meaning is certainly appropriate here. Blidad had illustrated God's dominion from his power in heaven. Job shows that it exists alike in heaven and earth (vers. 7-13), and in the region under the earth (vers. 5, 6). There, in Sheol, under the waters of the ocean, the dead tremble at the thought of the Most High; they tremble together with other inhabitants thereof, as evil spirits, rebel intelligences, east down to Hades, and there held in durance (Jude 1:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Hell is naked before him; i.e. \"can hide nothing from his eyes\" - shows all its inmost recesses. And destruction hath no covering; rather, Abaddon hath no covering (see the Revised Version). Abaddon is sometimes \"destruction,\" sometimes \"the angel of the bottomless pit\" (Revelation 9:11), sometimes \"the bottomless pit itself\" (Proverbs 15:11). Here the last of these three senses seems to suit best - the deepest depth of the bottomless pit is no secret to God,\" but \"naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do\" (Hebrews 4:13)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He streteheth out the north over the empty place. Over what was \"empty space\" or \"chaos\" (תּהוּ) God stretches out \"the north\" - a portion of his orderly creation - perhaps the northern portion of the heavens, where are the grandest constellations visible to the inhabitants of the world's northern half. And hangeth the earth upon nothing. \"Takes,\" i.e., \"the huge ball of the earth, and suspends it in vacancy, with nothing to support it but his own fixed will, his own firm laws.\" This is an idea scarcely reached by astronomers in general, at any rate till the time of Hippar-chus; and it has, not without reason, been regarded as \"a very remarkable instance of anticipation of the discoveries of science' (Stanley Loathes).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; i.e. he makes the clouds, that we see floating in the atmosphere, contain and hold the waters on which the productiveness of the earth depends, and which he restrains, or allows to fall in fertilizing rain, at his pleasure (comp. 1 Kings 17:1). And the cloud is not rent under them. The metaphor is, no doubt, drawn from those water-skins, so well known in the East, and especially in Arabia, in which men stored the water for their journeys and other needs, which were liable to be \"rent\" by the weight of the liquid within them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He holdeth back the face of his throne; rather, he covereth up. He makes the clouds to gather in the vault of heaven, above which is his throne, and in this way conceals it and covers it up. And spreadeth his cloud upon it; or, over it, so blotting it out from sight. Behind the more obvious meaning lies one which is deeper and more spiritual. God withdraws himself from sight, gathers clouds and darkness around him to be the habitation of his seat, hides from men the principles of his government and administration, makes himself unapproachable and inscrutable, is a mystery and an enigma which man cannot hope to understand or solve (comp. 1 Kings 8:12; Psalm 18:11; Psalm 97:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He hath compassed the waters with bounds. God restrains within limits alike the \"waters that are above the firmament\" and those that are beneath it (Job 38:11). The boundary is placed, somewhat vaguely, \"at the confines of light and darkness.\" Until the day and night come to an end is a mistranslation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The pillars of heaven tremble. The \"pillars of heaven\" are the mountains, on which the sky seems to rest. These \"tremble,\" or seem to tremble, at the presence of God (Psalm 18:7; Psalm 114:4; Isaiah 5:25) when he visits the earth in storm and tempest, either because the whole atmosphere is full of disturbance, and the outline of the mountains shifts and changes as rain and storm sweep over them, or because the reverberations of the thunder, which shake the air, seem to shake the earth also. And are astonished at his reproof. To the mind of the poet this \"trembling\" is expressive of astonishment and consternation. He regards the mountains as hearing the voice of God in the storm, recognizing it as raised in anger, and so trembling and cowering before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He divideth the sea with his power. \"Divideth\" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (־ָגַע) means either \"stirreth up\" or \"stilleth.\" In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud; literally, he smiteth through Rahab. (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.) God is said to have \"smitten him through by his understanding\" since in the contest between good and evil it is rather intelligence than mere force that carries the day. Power alone is sufficient to control the sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; or, by his spirit the heavens are brightness; i.e. at a breath from his mouth the heavens, lately all cloud and storm (vers. 8-11), recover their serenity, are calm and clear and bright. Our experience says, \"After a storm comes a calm.\" Job notes that both alike are from God. His hand hath formed the crooked serpent; rather, his hand hath pierced the swift serpent (see the Revised Version). The reference is probably to \"the war in heaven,\" already suggested by the mention of\" Rahab\" (ver. 12). In that war, according to the tradition that had reached Job, a great serpent, like the Egyptian Apepi (Apophis), had borne a part.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Lo, these are parts of his ways; literally, ends of his ways; i.e. the mere outskirts and fringe of his doings. But how small a portion is heard of him? rather, how small a whisper? But the thunder of his power who can understand?, or, the thunder of his mighty deeds. Job implies that he has not enumerated one-half of God's great works - he has just hinted at them, just whispered of them.

In the first, which extends to the end of ver. 6, Job is engaged in maintaining, with the utmost possible solemnity (ver. 2), both his actual integrity (ver. 6) and his determination to hold fast his integrity as long as he lives (vers. 4-6). In the second (vers. 7-10) he implicates a curse upon his enemies. In the third (vers. 11-23) he returns to the consideration of God's treatment of the wicked, and retracts the view which he had maintained controversially in Job 24:2-24, with respect to their prosperity, impunity, and equalization with the righteous in death. The retractation is so complete, the concessions are so large, that some have been induced to question whether they can possibly have been made by Job, and have been led on to suggest that we have here a third speech of Zophar's, such as \"the symmetry of the general form\" requires, which by accident or design has been transferred from him to Job. But the improbability of such a transfer, considering how in the Book of Job the speech of each separate interlocutor is introduced, is palpable; the dissimilarity between the speech and the other utterances of Zophar is striking; and (;he judgment of two such liberal critics as Ewald and Renan, that the passage is rightly placed, and rightly assigned to Job, should set all doubt at rest, and make an end of controversy (see Mr. Froude's 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1 pp. 315, 316; and Canon Cook's \"Introduction to the Book of Job,\" in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 7). Verse 1. - Moreover Job continued his parable, and said. The word translated \"parable\" (משׁל) is only used previously in Numbers 23, and 24. It is thought to \"comprehend all discourses in which the results of discursive thought are concisely or figuratively expressed\" (Cook). The introduction of a new term seems to imply that the present discourse occupies a position different from that of all the preceding ones. It is not tentative, controversial, or emotional, but expresses the deliberate judgment of the patriarch on the subjects discussed in it. Note the repetition of the term in Job 29:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, Job has not previously introduced any form of adjuration. His \"yea has been yea, and his nay nay.\" Now, however, under the solemn circumstances of the occasion, when he is making his last appeal to his friends for a favourable judgment, he thinks it not inappropriate to preface what he is about to say by an appeal to God as his Witness. \"As God liveth,\" or \"As the Lord liveth,\" was the customary oath of pious Israelites and of God-fearing men generally in the ancient world (see Judges 8:19; Ruth 3:13; 1 Samuel 14:39; 1 Samuel 20:3; 2 Samuel 4:9; 2 Samuel 12:5; 1 Kings 2:24; 1 Kings 17:21; 2 Kings 5:20; 2 Chronicles 18:13; Jeremiah 38:16). Job adds that the God to whom he appeals is he who has \"taken away,\" or \"withheld,\" his judgment, i.e. who has declined to enter with him into a controversy as to the justice of his doings (Job 9:32-35; 13:31; 23:3-7). And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; or, made my soul bitter. Though he slays him, yet does Job trust in God (Job 13:15).

This verse is parenthetic. Job claims in it to be in possession of all his faculties, notwithstanding his sufferings. The right translation would seem to be, \"For my life is yet whole within me\" (see the Revised Version). And the spirit of God is in my nostrils. The spirit of God, originally breathed into man's nostrils, whereby he became a living soul (Genesis 2:7), is still, Job says, within him, and makes him capable of judging and declaring what is right.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My lips shall not speak wickedness.

A confession of guilt, such as his friends have endeavoured to extort from him, would be both wicked and false.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5.- God forbid that I should justify you; i.e. allow that you have been right all along, and that I have drawn these judgments down upon me by secret sins. Till I die I willNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - My righteousness I held fast, and will not let it go. Not only will Job never cease to maintain his integrity in the past, but he will hold fast to the same course of blameless life in the future. He will not \"curse God, and die.\" Resolutely he will maintain his faith in God, and his dependence on him. \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.\" My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. This is probably the true meaning, though some suggest \"My heart doth not reproach me for any of my days\" Job determines to \"have always a conscience void of offence, both toward God and toward man\" (Acts 24:16; comp. Acts 23:1; 1 Corinthians 4:4; 2 Timothy 1:3; 1 John 3:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Let mine enemy be as the wicked. The nexus of this passage with what goes before is uncertain. Some suppose Job's full thought to have been, \"Ye try to persuade me to act wickedly by making a false representation of my feelings and convictions; but I absolutely refuse to do so. Let that rather be the act of my enemy.\" Others regard him as simply so vexed by his pretended friends, who are his real enemies, that he is driven to utter an imprecation against them. And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. This is another instance of a mere pleonastic hemistich - a repetition of the preceding clause in different words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained. The hypocrite and liar may get advantage in this life by his lies and his hypocrisy. He may deceive men; he may raise himself in their opinion; he may derive worldly advantage from having secured their approval But what will he have to look forward rein the end, when God taketh away (i.e. removeth from earth) his soul? Job evidently regards the soul that is \"taken away\" or removed from earth as still existing, still conscious, still capable of hope or of despair, and asks what hope of a happy future could the man who had lived a hypocrite entertain, when God required his soul, and he felt under God's judgment. The question reminds us of those words of our blessed Lord \"What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" (Mark 8:36, 37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon Him? Can he expect that in the day of trouble, \"when distress and anguish come upon him\" (Proverbs 1:27), God will hear his cry, and respond to it, and give him relief? No; conscious hypocrisy - living a lie - cuts off from God, severs between a man and his Maker, makes all prayers for help vain, until it is repented of and put away from us. The man who dies in it is in a desperate case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Will he delight himself in the Almighty? A further ill result of hypocrisy is noted. Not only does it alienate God from us, but it nile,ares us from God. The hypocrite cannot \"delight in the Almighty.\" He must shriek from him, tear him, dislike to dwell on the thought of his presence and realize it. His natural inclination must be to withdraw his thoughts from God, and give himself up to the worldliness which has been his attraction to assume the hypocrite's part. Will he always call upon God? Can be even be depended on not to renounce the service of God altogether? The mutual alienation above spoken of must tend to check communion, to disincline to prayer and calling upon God, to erect a barrier between the hypocrite and the Almighty, which, though for a while it may be insufficient to withstand the force of use and wont, will yet, in the long run, be sure to tell, and will either put an end to prayer altogether, or reduce it to a formality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-23. - It is impossible to deny that this passage directly contradicts Job's former utterances, especially Job 24:2-24. But the hypotheses which would make Job irresponsible for the present utterance and fix on him, as his steadfast conviction, the opposite theory, are unsatisfactory and have no solid basis. To suppose that Zophar is the real speaker is to imagine the absolute loss and suppression of two entire verses - one between vers. 10 and 11, assigning the speech to him, and another at the beginning of ch. 28, reintroducing Job and making him once more the interlocutor. That this should have happened by accident is inconceivable. Τὰ κατὰ τύχην οὐ πάνυ συνδυάζεται To ascribe it to intentional corruption by a Hebrew redactor, bent on maintaining the old orthodox view, and on falsely and wickedly giving the authority of Job to it (Froude 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1. p. 316), is to take away all authority from the existing text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to open a door to any amount of wild suggestion and conjectural emendation. The other hypothesis - that of Eichhorn - that Job is here simply anticipating what his adversaries will say, though a less dangerous view, is untenable, since Job never does this without following up his statement of the adversaries' ease with a reply, and here is no reply whatever, but a simple turning away, after ver. 23, to another subject. The explanation of the contradiction by supposing that Job's former statement was tentative and controversial, or else hasty and ill-considered, and that now, to prevent misconception, he determines to set himself right, is, on the other hand, thoroughly defensible, and receives a strong support from the remarkable introduction in ver. 11, which \"prepares us, if not for a recantation, yet (at any rate) for a modification of statements wrung from the speaker when his words flowed over from a spirit drunk with the poison of God's arrows\" (see the remarks of Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 90, which are in substantial agreement with those of Ewald said Dillmann). Verse 11. - I will teach you by (or, concerning) the hand of God. Job is now at last about to deliver his real sentiments respecting God's dealings with men in the world, and prefaces his. remarks with this solemn introduction, to draw special attention to them. He is aware that his previous statements on the subject, especially in Job 24:2-24, have been overstrained and exaggerated, and wishes, now that he is uttering his last words (Job 31:40), to correct his previous hasty utterances, and put on record his true views. That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. By \"that which is with the Almighty\" Job means the Divine principles of action.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it. The true Divine scheme of action has been so long and so frequently made manifest - openly set forth in the sight o! men - that Job cannot believe that those whom he addresses are ignorant of it. They must themselves have seen the scheme at work. Why then are ye thus altogether vain? Why, then, do they not draw true inferences from the facts that come under their notice?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This is the portion of a wicked men with God. In \"this\" Job includes all that follows from ver. 14 to ver. 23 - \"this, which I am going to lay down.\" He pointedly takes up the words of Zophar in Job 20:29, admitting their general truth. And the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. Retribution is \"their portion\" \"their heritage\" i.e. the natural result and consequence of their precedent sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword. Among the items of prosperity which Job had assigned to the wicked man in one of his previous discourses (Job 21:8, 11) was a numerous and flourishing offspring. Now he feels forced to admit that, frequently at any rate, this flourishing offspring is overtaken by calamity (Job 21:19) - it falls by the sword, either in predatory warfare, to which it was bred up, or as the consequence of a blood-feud inherited from its progenitor. They who \"take the sword,\" either in their own persons or in their posterity, \"perish with the sword.\" And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. If they escape this fate, then, mostly, they fall into poverty, and suffer want, no one caring to relieve them, since they have an ill reputation, the memory of their parent's wickedness clinging to them long after his decease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThose that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Those that remain of him shall be buried in death. Not simply \"shall die,\" but shall \"be buried,\" i.e. lost sight of, and forgotten, \"in death.\" And his widows shall not weep (scrap. Psalm 78:64). The deaths of his offspring shall not be lamented by their widows - a very grievous omission in the eyes of Orientals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Though he heap up silver as the dust. The city of Tyro, we are told by Zechariah, \"heaped up silver as the dust\" (Zechariah 9:3), i.e. in vast quantities, beyond count. So might the wicked man do. He might also prepare raiment as the clay; i.e. fill his house with rich dresses, partly for his own wear, partly to be given as robes of honour to his friends and boon companions (setup. Genesis 45:22; 2 Kings 5:22; 2 Kings 10:22, Matthew 6:19; James 5:2). Robes of honour are still kept in store by Eastern monarchs, and presented as marks of favour to visitors of importance,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on. The raiment thus accumulated shall pass from the wicked into the hands of the just, who at his death shall enter upon his inheritance (Job 20:18, 20, 28). And the innocent shall divide the silver (see the first clause of ver. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He buildeth his house as a moth. The moth is the symbol of fragility, decay, and weakness. The wicked man's attempt to build himself up a house, and establish a powerful family, is no better than a moth's attempt to make itself a permanent habitation. As moths do not construct dwellings for themselves, it has been proposed (Merx) to read כעכבישׁ, \"as a spider,\" for מעשׁ, \"as a moth;\" but the change is too great to be at all probable. May not the cocoon, from which the moth issues as. from a house, have been in Job's mind? The hawk-moth buries itself in a neat cave for the pupa stage; and there may have been even better examples in Uz. But we ourselves have not known these facts long, and therefore we need not be surprised to find Job making a mistake in natural history. And as a booth that the keeper maketh. Huts or lodges of boughs were set up in vineyards and orchards by those who had to watch them (see Isaiah 1:8; Lamentations 2:6). They were habitations of the weakest and frailest kind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The rich man lieth down; rather, he lieth down rich (see the Revised Version). But he shall not be gathered. If we accept the present text, we may translate, But it (i.e. his wealth) shall not be gathered' and suppose his wealth to have consisted in agricultural produce. Or we may alter יאספ into יוסיפ, and translate, He lieth down rich, but he shall do so no more - a correction to which the οὐ προσθήσει of the Septuagint points. He openeth his eyes, and he is not. Some translate, \"It is not;\" i.e. the harvest, in which his wealth consisted, is not - it has been all destroyed by blight or robbers Those who render, \"He is not,\" generally suppose that he opens his eyes only to find himself in the hands of murderers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTerrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Terrors take hold on him as waters (comp. Job 18:11). Terrors sweep over the wicked man like a flood of waters - vague terrors with respect to the past, the present, and the future. He fears the vengeance of these whom he has oppressed and injured, the loss of his prosperity at any moment by a reverse of fortune, and a final retribution at the hand of God commensurate with his ill desert. He is at all times uneasy; sometimes he experiences a sudden rush upon him of such gloomy thoughts, which overwhelms him, and sweeps him away like a mighty stream. A tempest stealeth him away in the night. While he is off his guard, as it were, in the night, a sudden storm bursts on him, and removes him from his place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth. The khamsin wind, coming with all its violence and burning heat, drives him before it, and is irresistible (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 482). And as a storm hurleth him out of his place. This is little more than a repetition of the previous hemistich. The man is swept from the earth by a storm of calamityNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For God shall out upon him, and not spare. Some commentators regard the storm as still the subject, and translate, \"For it shall east itself upon him [or, 'rush upon him'] and not spore\" (Sohultens, Merx). The difference is not great, since the storm represents God's judgment. He would fain flee out of his hand; or, if the storm is meant, out of its hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob27:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Men shall clap their hands at him. Applauding, i.e. the just judgment of God upon him. And shall hiss him out of his place. Accompany with hisses his final ruin and downfall - hissing him, while they applaud the action of God in respect to him.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-28. - The connection of this chapter with the preceding is somewhat obscure. Probably we are to regard Job as led to see, even while he is justifying God's ways with sinners (Job 27:8-23), how many and how great are the difficulties in the way of forming a single consistent theory of the Divine action, which shall be applicable to all cases. Hence he comes to the conclusion that God is incomprehensible by man and inscrutable; and that it is only given to man to know him sufficiently for his practical guidance. To impress this on his hearers is his main object (vers. 12-28); and, to impress it the more, he introduces it by a sharp contrast. Wonderful as is man's cleverness and ingenuity in respect of earthly things and physical phenomena (vers. 1-11), with respect to heavenly things and the spiritual world - wherewith true wisdom is concerned - he knows next to nothing. All that he knows is just enough to guide his conduct aright (ver. 28). Verse 1. - Surely there is a vein for the silver; literally, an issue for silver? i.e. a place or places whence it is drawn forth from the earth. The silver-mines of Spain were very early worked by the Phoenicians, and produced the metal in great abundance (see the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' p. 314). But Asia itself was probably the source whence silver was obtained in primitive times. And a place for gold where they fine it; or, fuse it. Gold is very widely spread over the earth's surface, and in ancient times was especially abundant in Arabia (Diod. Sic.. 2:1; 3:42; Strabo, 16:4. § 18; Pit,y, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:32, etc.); so that Job might easily have been acquainted with the processes of fusing and refining it. Two processes of refining are mentioned by Diodorus as practised by the Egyptians (3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Iron is taken out of the earth (see the comment on Job 20:24). Iron was found in the hills of Palestine (Deuteronomy 8:9), in the trans-Jordanic region (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 4:8. § 2), in the sandstone of the Lebanon ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 47), and in Egypt ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 93), probably also in many other places. It is scarcely ever found except in the shape of iron ore, and so has to be \"taken out of the earth.\" And brass is molten out of the stone. By \"brass\" we must understand copper, since the amalgam brass is never found in a natural state. Copper was yielded abundantly in very early times by the mines which the Egyptians worked in the Sinaitic peninsula ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 93, 94). It was also obtainable from Palestine (Deuteronomy 8:9), Cyprus ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 311), and Armenia (Ezekiel 27:13). Sometimes it is found pure, but generally in the shape of copper ore, which has to be \"molten\" for the pure metal to run off.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He setteth an end to darkness. Man, in his desire to obtain these metals, \"setteth an end to darkness,\" i.e. letteth in the light of day, or the artificial light which he carries with him, upon the natural abode of darkness, the inner parts of the earth. The miner's first operation is to pierce the ground with a shaft, perpendicular, horizontal, or oblique, as suits his purpose. Through this the light enters into what was previously pitch darkness. And searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death; rather, and searcheth out to the furthest bound the stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death; explores, i.e. the entire murky regina within the earth, notwithstanding its fearful gloom and obscurity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant. This passage is very obscure; but recent critics suggest, as its probable meaning, \"He (i.e. the miner) breaketh open a shaft, away from where men inhabit\" (see the Revised Version). The miner does not wish to be interfered with, and therefore sinks his shaft in some wild spot, far from the habitations of men. Even the waters forgotten of the foot; rather, they are forgotten of the foot; i.e. no one visits them; they are left alone; they are \"forgotten of the foot\" of the passer-by. They are dried up, they are gone away from men; rather, they hang swinging to and fro far from men. The descent of the shaft is made by a rope, to which they \"hang swinging\" all the time that they defend. As they have sought secrecy, all this takes place far from the haunts of men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As for the earth, out of it cometh bread. Man's cleverness is such that he turns the earth to various uses. By tillage of its surface he causes it to produce the staff of life, bread: and by his mining operations the under part of it is turned up as fire, or rather, as by fire. Fire was used in some of the processes whereby masses of material were detached and forced to yield their treasures (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 33:4. § 73).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The stones of it are the place of sapphires. Among the rocks and stones whereof the interior of the earth is mainly composed are found gems of inestinable value, for instance, sapphires. It is doubtful whether the Hebrew sapphire (ספיר) was the gem which bears that name among ourselves, or the lapis lazuli. In either case it was highly esteemed, and appeared in kings' crowns (Ezekiel 28:13), and in the high priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:18); Job notes its high value in ver. 16. And it (i.e. the earth) hath dust of gold; literally, dusts; i.e. a multitude of small specks or atoms. In the auriferous rocks gold is commonly scattered in such specks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There is a path which no fowl knoweth; or, his is a path which no bird of prey knoweth (see the Revised Version). The miner's path through the bowels of the earth is intended. And which the vulture's eye hath not seen. The vulture is probably the most keen-sighted of birds, but it cannot even get a glimpse of the subterraneous path which the miner treads.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The lion's whelps have not trodden it; literally, the sons of the fierce - the whelps of lions, tigers, or leopards may be intended. These beasts would haunt the mountains and penetrate into natural caverns, but would never adventure themselves in the shafts and adits of miners. Nor the fierce lion passed by it; rather, passed thereby (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He putteth forth his hand upon the rock. Our Revisers translate, upon the flinty rock; while Canon Cook maintains that \"the word used means either granite or quartz.\" Probably Job meant no more than that man does not shrink from attacking any - even the hardest - rock; but will subdue it, and cut his way through it, if he has occasion so to do. He overturneth the mountains by the roots. Herodotus, in describing what he had seen of the Phoenician mining operations in the island of Thasos, observes, \"a huge, mountain has been turned upside down in the search for ores\" (Herod., 6:47). Pliny says of the process employed for detaching huge masses from the metalliferous hills in Spain, \"They attack the rock with iron wedges and hammers. When this work is complete, they destroy the supports, and notify by signal that the fall is about to take place. A watchman, stationed on the mountain-top, alone understands the signal; and he proceeds at once to have all the workmen called in, and himself makes a hurried retreat. Then the mountain falls m upon itself with a crash that cannot be imagined, and an incredible concussion of the air. The successful engineers contemplate the ruin which they have achieved\" ('Hist. Nat.,' 33:4. § 73).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He cutteth out rivers among the rocks. Some understand this of man's general ability to cut canals and tunnels, and change the course of rivers. But the allusion is more probably to the works undertaken in mines for the carrying off of the water from them. Diodorus says that when subterranean springs were tapped in mines, which threatened to flood them, it was usual to construct ducts, or tunnels, by which the inconvenient liquid might be carried off to a lower level (Diod. Siculus, 5:37. § 3). And his eye seeth every precious thing. Nothing escapes his notice. Even as he constructs these duets he has his eye open to note any signs of mineral wealth, of metals or of precious stones, that occur along the line of his excavation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He bindeth the floods from overflowing. This, again, may be either taken generally of man's ability to create dams, dykes, and embankments, whereby the overflow of waters is prevented; or specially of such works when connected with mines, from which it is possible, in some instances, to dam out water that would otherwise interfere with their working. The word translated \"overflowing\" means probably \"weeping,\" and seems to point to that leakage from the roofs and sides of galleries and adits which is more difficult to control and stop than even subterranean springs or rivers. And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. This is the final result of mining operations. Things useful or beautiful that are hiddden deep down in the heart of the earth, and that might have seemed wholly inaccessible, are brought out of the pit's month into the light of day for the service and delectation of mankind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-28. - Here we come on an abrupt change. From human ingenuity and contrivance Job turns to the consideration of \"wisdom\" - that wisdom which has been defined as \"the reason which deals with principles \"(Canon Cook). \"Where,\" he asks, \"is this to be found?\" It is a wholly different thing from cleverness and ingenuity. It inquires into causes and origins, into the ends and purposes of things; it seeks to solve the riddle of the universe. Perfect wisdom can, of course, only dwell with God (ver. 23). Man must be content with something much below this. With him \"the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding\" (ver. 28). Verse 12. - But where shall wisdom be found? \"Wisdom is the principal thing,\" says Solomon (Proverbs 4:7); and again, \"It is better to get wisdom than gold\" (Proverbs 16:16). But where is it to be found? Job's three friends thought that it dwelt with them (Job 12:2); but this was a mistake, since God reproaches them with their \"folly\" (Job 42:8). Job does not claim to possess it (Job 26:3); he only desires it. It is his deep conviction that it is only possessed, in the true sense of the word, by God. And where is the place of understanding? It is not quite clear whether Job intends to make any distinction between \"wisdom\" (חכמה) and \"understanding\" (בינה). Canon Cook suggests that \"wisdom\" is \"the reason which deals with principles,\" and \"understanding\" \"the faculty which discerns and appreciates their application.\" But refined distinctions of this kind are scarcely suitable to the age of Job. Dean Plumptre, in his comment on Proverbs ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 529), accepts the distinction implied in the Septuagint translation of that book, which renders חכמה by σοφία' and בינה by φρόνησις. This is a much simpler and more easily understood distinction, being that which separates between scientific know. ledge and the practical intelligence which directs conduct. But it may be doubted whether Job does not use the two words as synonyms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMan knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Man knoweth not the price thereof. The real value of wisdom cannot be estimated in terms of ordinary human calculation. It transcends figures. Neither is it found in the land of the living. True wisdom, such as Job is speaking of (see the comment on vers. 12-28), does not exist among men. It transcends human faculties, and is among the peculiar possessions of the Most High (ver. 23). Hence the Most High is altogether inscrutable by man\" his ways are past finding out.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. The deep abysses of the ocean declare that it is not with them; and the wide reaches of the far-extending sea proclaim that it is not with them either.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - It cannot be gotten for gold. No amount of gold can purchase it; no, not of the purest and most refined quality (1 Kings 6:20, 21), for it is not a thing that can be bought or sold God must grant it, and find a way of imparting it; which he certainly will not do for a sum of money. Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof; If gold cannot purchase it, much less can silver - the less valuable medium of exchange. (On the weighing of silver, in sales, see Genesis 23:16; Jeremiah 32:9; Ezra 8:26.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir. The locality of Ophir has been much contested, but, on the whole, the weight of evidence would seem to be in favour of Arabia, on the south-east coast (see the article on \"Ophir\" in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' which exhausts all that can be said on the subject). The high estimation in which \"gold of Ophir\" was held appears not only in this passage, but also in Job 22:24; Psalm 45:9: and Isaiah 13:12. It is to be accounted for by the imperfection of all the anciently known processes of refining, which left the best refined gold inferior to the natural product of the Ophir mines or washings. With the precious onyx, or the sapphire. (On the latter of these two stones, see the comment upon ver. 6.) The \"onyx\" is probably the stone now known as the \"sardonyx,\" which was highly prized by the ancients. It had a place in the breastplate of the high priest (Exodus 28:20), and is mentioned among the treasures of the King of Tyre (Ezekiel 28:13). The sardonyx presents layers variously coloured, as blue, black, white, and vermilion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The gold and the crystal cannot equal it; rather, gold and crystal. This second mention of gold (see ver. ]5) seems superfluous, but perhaps the patriarch is thinking of some goblet or ornament in which crystal and gold were combined together. Ornaments of this kind bare been found in Phoenicia ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' pp. 362, 370). And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold; or, vessels of fine gold. Both in Egypt and Phoenicia vessels of gold were common.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - No mention shall be made of coral. The word translated \"coral\" (רָאמות) means properly \"things that are high.\" It occurs only here and in Ezekiel 27:16. The rabbinical interpretation of the word as \"coral\" is doubtful, since it was unknown to the LXX. Or of pearls. The word gabish (גָבִישׁ) occurs only in this place. Some identify it with rock-crystal. For the price of wisdom is above rubies. Here we have another obscure word (פָנִינִים), which is variously rendered by \"rubies,\" \"pearls,\" \"carbuncles,\" and \"red coral.\" The balance of authority is in favour of pearls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it. It is generally allowed that the pithdath (פִטְדַת) is either the \"topaz\" or the \"chrysolite.\" In favour of its being the chrysolite is the passage of Pliny which mentions its being esteemed for its green tints ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:8). Otherwise \"topaz\" might have appeared to be the best rendering. By \"Cush,\" here translated \"Ethiopia,\" is probably meant Cushite Arabia, or the southern and south-eastern regions (see the author's 'Origin of Nations,' pp. 206-209). Neither shall it be valued with pare gold. Of the four words used for \"gold\" in this passage (vers. 15-17), one (זהב) seems to be the common name, and to designate the metal by its coleus, \"yellow,\" since צָהַב means \"to be yellow\" Another (סָגוּר) means properly \"what is treasured,\" or \"shut up,\" from סָגַר, \"to shut.\" The third (פַז) seems to be the name for \"native gold,\" or that found in river-washings and nuggets, which was regarded as the purest. The fourth (כֶּחֶם) is a poetical name only, and designates gold of extreme purity (Song of Solomon 5:11), whether highly refined or native. Job uses them all, to show that there was no gold of any kind wherewith it was possible to purchase wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? This is a repetition of ver. 12, with a mere variant of the verb in the first line. Job's elaborate inquiry of vers. 14-19 having thresh no light on the subject, the original question recurs - Where does wisdom come from?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living. Man cannot see it, because it is immaterial, but he cannot even conconceive of it, because its nature transcends him. And kept close from the fowls of the air. (comp. ver. 7). The sight of birds is far keener than that of man; but even birds cannot detect where wisdom is.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDestruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. \"Death and destruction\" seem to represent the inhabitants of Sheol - the world of the departed. Job personifies them, and represents them as saying, that in their gloomy and remote abode (Job 10:21, 22) they have heard some dim rumour, some vague report, of the \"place\" of wisdom and understanding, the nature of which, however, they do not communicate to him. His idea seems to be that their knowledge on the subject does not much transcend the knowledge of living men, whom he regards as profoundly ignorant with respect to it. He thus prepares the way for his assertion in the next verse. Man, neither living nor dead, can make any answer to the great question raised; but -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. God only understands what true wisdom is. It is a part of his being, an essential element of his nature. He knows \"the way\" of it, i.e. how it works and manifests itself; and he knows \"the place' of it, i.e. where it dwells, what limits it has, if any, and how far it is communicable to any beside himself. The highest knowledge is all hid in God (Colossians 2-3); and, except so far as God imparts it to him, man can know nothing of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - For he looketh to the ends of the earth. Man is conditioned. God is unconditioned. Man's knowledge has strict and narrow limits. God \"looketh unto the ends of the earth.\" It is the universality of God's knowledge that makes each item of it perfect. Where knowledge is circumscribed, it is impossible to be sure that some truth outside the circle of the person's cognizance has not a bearing on that which is within his cognizance - a bearing, which, if he were aware of it, would give the truth a different aspect. With God alone there are no such limits, everything being within his cognizance. And seeth under the whole heaven. As his knowledge of earthly things is unlimited, so is his knowledge of heavenly things also; and not only of heavenly things in a material sense, as of sun, moon, stars, comets, planets, nebulae, etc., but also of causes, principles, ends, laws, and the like, whereby both material and immaterial things are governed, ordered, and maintained in being. Of matters of this kind and character man can only say, \"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; I cannot attain unto it\" (Psalm 139:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - To make the weight for the winds. God by his wisdom gives to winds their exactly fitting degree of force and violence, so that they perform the work in the world which they were intended to perform, and which would not be performed, were they either of a less or of a greater intensity. And he weigheth the waters by measure (comp. Isaiah 40:12, \"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with a span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?\"). Everything in creation is duly proportioned to every other thing. All is ordered \"by weight and with care.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - When he made a decree for the rain. God \"made a decree for the rain\" when be placed the fall of rain under fixed and unalterable laws. In some countries rainy seasons begin almost regularly on a fixed day in the calendar, while for several months in the year it is almost certain that rain will not fall. Even where there is no such exact regularity as this, the rainfall has its laws, since there are maxima and minima which are never exceeded. And a way for the lightning of the thunder. God gave laws to the electric current, and prescribed the \"way\" that it should take in its passage from heaven to earth, or from cloud to cloud, or from earth to heaven. Everything was ruled beforehand by Infinite Wisdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Then did he see it, and declare it. From the creation of the world, and before it, God foresaw all that was necessary to maintain his universe in the perfect order and the perfect beauty that he designed for it. At the Creation he, in a certain sense, \"declared it,\" or set it forth, before such intelligences as then existed. Subsequently, in part to Adam, in part to Noah, in part to Moses, he further declared, by revelation, at any rate a portion of the design of his creation, and of the laws by which it was regulated. He prepared it, yea, and searched it out. This is an inversion of what seems to us the natural order, whereof there are many examples. God must first have investigated and searched out, in his own secret counsels, the entire scheme of creation, and afterwards have proceeded to the \"preparation\" or \"establishment\" of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And unto man he said. Not in so many words, not by any written or spoken revelation; but by the nature which he implanted in man, and especially by the conscience wherewith he endowed him. Man feels in his heart of hearts that whatever wisdom may be in the abstract, his true wisdom is \"the fear of God,\" his true understanding \"to depart from evil.\" No amount of intelligence, no amount of cleverness, or of information, or of knowledge, or of worldly or scientific wisdom, will be of any avail to him, unless he starts with this \"beginning\" (Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 1:7), and builds on this foundation. This foundation, at any rate, Job had. since God bore him witness that he had it (Job 2:3).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Job continued his parable, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-25. - From these deep musings upon the nature of true wisdom, and the contrast between the ingenuity and cleverness of man and the infinite knowledge of God, Job turns to another contrast, which he pursues through two chapters (ch. 29. and 30.) - the contrast between what he was and what he is - between his condition in the period of his prosperity and that to which he has been reduced by his afflictions. The present chapter is concerned only with the former period; and gives a graphic description of the life led, in Job's time and country, by a great chieftain, the head of a tribe, not of mere nomads, but of perseus who had attained to a considerable amount of civilization. The picture is one primitive in its features, but not rude or coarse. It is entirely un-Jewish, and has its nearest parallel in some of the early Egyptian records, as the Stele of Beka, and the Instructions of Amen-em-hat ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 10. pp. 7-10). Verse 1. - Moreover Job continued his parable, and said (see the comment on Job 27:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Oh that I were as in months past! or, in the months of old. To Job the period of his prosperity seems long, long ago - some-thing far away in the mist of time, which he recalls with difficulty. As in the days when God preserved me. Job never forgets to refer his prosperity to God, or to be grateful to him for it (see Job 1:21; Job 2:10; Job 10:8-12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When his candle shined upon my head (comp. Psalm 18:28, \"For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness\"). A \"candle,\" or \"lamp,\" is a general symbol in Scripture for life and prosperity. God is said to light men's candles when he blesses them and maizes his countenance to shine upon them; conversely, when he withdraws his favour he is said to put their candles out (Job 18:6; Job 21:17). And when by his light I walked through darkness. The light of God's countenance shining about a man's path enables him to walk securely even through thick darkness, i.e. through trouble and perplexity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - As I was in the days of my youth; literally, in the days of my autumn - by which Job probably means the days of his \"ripeness\" or \"full manhood\" - which he had reached when his calamities fell upon him. When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; or, the counsel of God; when, i.e., in my tent I held sweet counsel with God, and communed with him as friend with friend (comp. Psalm 25:14, \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant;\" and Proverbs 3:32, \"For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - When the Almighty was yet with me. These are terribly sad words. Job, in his afflictions, has come to look on the Almighty as no longer \"with him \" - no longer on his side; but rather against him, an enemy (see Job 6:4; Job 7:19; Job 9:17; Job 10:16, etc.). When my children were about me (comp. Job 1:2, 4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - When I washed my steps with butter. Trod, as it were, upon fatness, moved amid all that was gladsome, joyful, and delicious. And the rock poured me out rivers of oil. \"The rock\" is probably the ground, rugged and stony, on which his olives grew. \"Olives,\" says Dr. Cunningham Geikie, \"flourish best on sandy or stony soil\" ('The Holy Land and the Bible' vol. 1. p. 138) They brought him in so great a quantity of oil that the rock seemed to him to flow with rivers of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - When I went out to the gate through the city; rather, by the city, or over against the city. The \"gate\" was the place where justice was administered, and public business generally despatched. It would be \"over against\" the city, separated from it by a large square or place (רְחוב), in which a multitude might assemble (sue Nehemiah 8:1). Hither Job was accustomed to proceed from time to time, to act as judge and administrator. When I prepared my seat in the street. On such occasions a seat would be brought out and \"prepared,\" where the judge would sit to hear causes and deliver sentences (comp. Nehemiah 3:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The young men saw me, and hid themselves; retired, i.e. withdrew to corners, that they might not obtrude themselves on one so much their superior. Compare the respect paid to age by the Spartans. And the aged arose, and stood up. Here the respect paid was not to age so much as to dignity. Men as old as himself, or older, paid Job the compliment of standing up until he was seated, in consideration of his rank and high office. So. in many assemblies, as in our own courts of justice, in Convocation, and elsewhere, when the president enters, all rise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The princes refrained talking. The other head-men of the tribe, recognizing Job's superior rank and dignity, refrained from words as soon as he made his appearance, and in silence awaited what he would say. Perhaps we are scarcely to understand literally the further statement that they laid their hand on their mouth, which is probably as much an idiom as our phrase, \"they held their tongues \"(comp. Job 21:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The nobles held their peace. The other leading men followed the example of the \"princes,\" and equally kept silence till Job had spoken. And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their month. A pleonastic repetition. The meaning is simply they said nothing, they stood in rapt attention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When the ear heard me, then it blessed me. Job, having described his reception by the nobles and chief men of the city, proceeds to speak of the behaviour of the common people. The former were respectful and attent, the latter rejoiced and made acclamation. Being of the class most exposed to oppression and wrong, they hailed in the patriarch a champion and a protector. They were sure of redress and justice where he was the judge. And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me. The eye of the poor man lighted up with joy and rejoicing as Job sat down upon the seat of judgment, thus hearing witness to his fairness, candour, and integrity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Because I delivered the poor that cried (compare the Instructions of Amen-em-hat: \"Because I have made the afflicted ones free from their afflictions, so that their cries are heard no more\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2 p. 12). And again the Inscription of Ameni-Amenemha: \"No little child have I injured; no widow have I oppressed; no fisherman have I hindered; no shepherd have I detained; no foreman have I taken from his gang to employ him in forced labour\" (ibid., vol. 12:63). And the fatherless, and him that had none to help him (compare what is said of the ideal king in Psalm 72:12-14,\" He shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall sabre the souls of the needy. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight\"). Championship of the poor was anciently regarded as characteristic of the wise, good, strong ruler.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me (comp. ver. 11). Oppression in the East sometimes drives its victims to actual starvation or to suicide. Isaiah calls the oppressors against whom he inveighs \"murderers\" (Isaiah 1:21). These \"perishing\" ones Job often saved, and they \"blessed\" him. And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. How cold are the words of Ameni, \"No widow have I oppressed,\" compared with these! Job was not content with mere abstinence from evil, mere negative virtue. He so actively and effectually relieved distress that affliction was turned into happiness, and lamentation into rejoicing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I put on righteousness, and it clothed me (comp. Isaiah 61:10; Psalm 132:9, etc.). Job \"put on righteousness;\" i.e. made it as the garment wherewith he clothed himself withal (Psalm 109:18, 19), covered up with it all his own natural imperfections, and made it part and parcel of his being. It was a beautiful covering, and, when once he had put it on, it clung to him, and could not be removed. It \"clothed him,\" or rather, if we translate the Hebrew literally, \"clothed itself with him.\" putting him on, as he had put it on. It was not merely external; it was internal, a habit of his soul and spirit. My judgment was as a robe and a diadem; rather, my justice (see the Revised Version). My \"justice,\" or \"righteousness\" (for the words are synonymous), was at once my robe and my crown, my necessary clothing and my ornament (comp. Isaiah 61:10, \"He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. The Persian kings had officials, whom they called their \"eyes\" and their \"ears\" - observers who were to inform them of all that went on in the provinces ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 213). Job acted as \"eyes\" to the blind of his time, giving them the information which their infirmity hindered them from obtaining. He was also feet to the lame, taking messages for them, going on their errands, and the like. He was kind and helpful to his fellow-men, not only in great, but also in little matters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I was a father to the poor (comp. ver. 12, and see below, ch. 31:16-22): and the cause which I knew not I searched out; rather, the cause of him that I knew not I searched out (see the Revised Version). When men were quite unknown to him, Job still gave to their causes the utmost possible attention, \"searching them out,\" or investigating them, as diligently as if they had been the causes of his own friends.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And I brake the jaws of the wicked (comp. Psalm 58:6). It is scarcely meant, as Canon Cook supposes, that Job was himself the executioner. \"Quod facit per allure facit per so.\" Job would regard as Age doing what he ordered to be done. And plucked the spoil out of his teeth. Either by disappointing him of a prey which he was on the verge of making ms own, or by compelling him to make restitution of a prey that he had actually laid hold of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Then I said, I shall die in my nest. The metaphor of \"nest\" for \"dwelling-place\" occurs in Numbers 24:21; Jeremiah 49:16: Obadiah 1:4; and Habakkuk 2:9. It is also employed by Healed ('Op. et Di.,' 1:301). And I shall multiply my days as the sand. Some translate, \"I shall multiply my days as the phoenix,\" the fabulous bird which was supposed to live for five hundred years (Herod., 2:72), to burn itself on a funeral pile of spices, and then to rise again from its ashes. But the view seems to be a mere rabbinical tradition, and is unsupported by etymology. Khal (חול) means \"sand\" in Genesis 22:17; Jeremiah 33:22; and elsewhere. It is taken in this sense by Rosenmuller, Schultens, Professor Lee, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - My root was spread out by the waters (comp. Psalm 1:3; Jeremiah 17:8); rather, to the waters - so that the waters reached it and nourished it. And the dew lay all night upon my branch. Job compares himself, in his former prosperous state, to a tree growing by a river-side, which receives a double nourishment - from the actual water of the stream, which reaches its roots, and from the moisture evaporated from the stream, which hangs in the air, and descends in the shape of dew upon its leaves and branches. Both sources of refreshment represent the grace and favour of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - My glory was fresh in me; i.e. \"my glory remained fresh\" - received no tarnish, continued as bright as it had been at the first. And my bow was renewed in my hand. My strength did not fail. When it seemed on the point of failing, it was secretly and mysteriously \"renewed.\" Some commentators regard vers. 19 and 20 as a portion of the speech begun in ver. 18, and view the verbs, not as past tenses, but as futures (compare the translation of the Revised Version). The general meaning is much the same, whichever of the two views we take.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel (comp. vers. 9, 10). Job, however, does not repeat himself, sines in the previous passage he is speaking of his work and office as judge, whereas now he declares the position which he had occupied among his countrymen as statesman and counsellor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - After my words they spake not again. When Job had spoken, the debate commonly came to an end. It was felt that all had been said, and that further remark would be superfluous. And my speech dropped upon them (comp. Deuteronomy 32:2, \"My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew\"). The silent, penetrating influence of wise counsel is glanced at.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - They waited for me as for the rain; i.e. \"they were as eager to heat' me speak as the parched ground is to receive the winter rain, which it expects and waits for and absorbs greedily.\" And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. They drank in my discourse as the spring vegetation drinks in the spring showers, known in the East generally as \"the latter rains.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - If I laughed on them, they believed it not; rather, if I smiled on them. If, as a mark of favour, I smiled on any, they thought it such graciousness and condescension that they could scarcely believe it possible. And the light of my countenance they cast not down.

Though not an absolute monarch, but only a patriarchal head, I practically determined the course which the tribe took, since my advice was always followed. I thus \"sat chief\" - nay, dwelt as a king in the army (or, in the host i.e. among the people), as one that comforteth the mourners; i.e. as one to whom all looked for comfort in times of distress and calamity, as much as for counsel and guidance at other times (vers. 21-23).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-13. - This chapter concludes the \"Introductory section.\" It consists of three parts. Vers. 1-6 contain an account of Satan's second appearance in the courts of heaven, and of a second colloquy between him and the Almighty. Vers. 7-10 contain the sequel to this colloquy, viz. Satan's further affliction of Job, and his conduct under it. Vers. 11-13 contain an account of the arrival of Job's three special friends to mourn with him and to comfort him; and of their behavior during the first seven days after their arrival Verse 1. - Again there was a day when the sons of God same to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. There is no \"again\" in the original. The words used are an exact repetition of those contained in ver. 6 of ch. 1. But they mark, no doubt, a second occasion on which the angelic host came to present themselves before the throne of God, and Satan came with them. To present himself before the Lord. These words are additional to those used in the former passage. We may gather from them, that, whereas on the former occasion Satan came only to observe, and with no intention of drawing God's special attention to himself, he now had such intention, and looked forward to a colloquy. He anticipated, doubtless, that the circumstances of Job's probation would be referred to, and he had prepared himself to make answer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it (see the comment on Job 1:7, of which this is an almost exact repetition).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou conquered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Thus far is identical with Job 1:1 (quod vide). The rest of the verse is additional, having reference to the conduct of Job under his earlier trials (Job 1:20-22). And still he holdeth fast his integrity. This has been justly called \"the key-note of the whole book\" (Cook). Satan had declared that Job's integrity rested on no solid basis, and would easily be overthrown and disappear. God, confident in his servant's faithfulness and truth, had allowed him to assail it. What was the result? God declares it with his own mouth. Job's \"integrity\" had not been wrested from him; he still maintained it (Job 1:21, 22), as he was about to do till the end (Job 42:1-6). Compare the ideal \"just man\" of Horace -NEWLINENEWLINEJustum et tenacem propositi virumNEWLINENon civium ardor prava jubentium,NEWLINENon vultus instantis tyrannyNEWLINEMenta quatit solida, neque Anster,NEWLINEDux inquieti turbidus Hadriae ....NEWLINESi fractus illabatur orbis,NEWLINEImpavidum ferient ruinae.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Od.,' 3:3.) Although thou movedst me against him (see Job 1:9-11), to destroy him; literally, to swallow him up; i.e. to ruin him, overwhelm him with calamities. Without cause; i.e. \"when he had done nothing to deserve such treatment.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin. No doubt a proverbial expression, resembling \"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth; Tit for tat,\" and the like; but not expressive of retaliation. Satan means that, to keep his own \"skin\" intact, a man will sacrifice another's \"skin;\" even that of his nearest and dearest. Job, he insinuates, submitted to the loss of his children without a murmur, because he feared that otherwise God would stretch forth his hand against his person, and smite it or destroy it. He cannot imagine any motive for submission and apparent resignation but a selfish one (comp. Job 1:9). Yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life; i.e. \"a man will submit to the loss, not only of all his possessions, but even of those whom he loves best, to save his own life - he will do anything for that.\" So the \"false accuser.\" All the numerous acts of self-sacrifice which human history presents, and has presented from the first, are ignored.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; i.e. \"his person\" - any part of his body. And he will curse thee to thy face (see the comment on Job 11:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold he is in thine hand; i.e. \"he is in thy power, to do with him as thou pleasest\" - except in one respect. Again it is strongly marked that Satan's power is under God's control, and extends only so far as God shows. But save his life; rather, only spare his life (Revised Version). The didactic purposes for which God was allowing his faithful servant to be tried in the furnace of affliction would have been frustrated by Job's removal from the earth. Individually he might equally well have been compensated in another world; but then the lesson of his example to living men, and the lesson of his story to all future generations of mankind, would have been lost. Besides, God but rarely, in the old world, gave a faithful servant, still in the full vigour of life (Job 42:16, 17), \"over unto death\" (Psalm 118:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7.- So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord (comp. Job 1:12, ad fin.). Satan, we may be sure, is always anxious to quit the immediate presence oNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal. \"The surface of the integuments,\" says Dr. Quain, \"is often much inflamed, and sometimes discharges a serous ichor, or chyle-like fluid, according to the extent to which the lymphatics are engaged in the particular ease\" (ibid., p. 432). This \"serous or lymph-like fluid\" is occasionally \"acrid and offensive.\" Job seems to have used his potsherd to scrape it away. And he sat down among the ashes. Not as a curative process, or even as an alleviation of his pains, but simply as was the custom of mourners (comp. Isaiah 47:3; Isaiah 58:5; Jeremiah 6:26; Ezekiel 27:30; Jonah 3:6). The LXX. renders, \"on the dung-heap;\" but this meaning, if a possible one, is highly improbable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Job's wife had said nothing when the other calamities had taken place - then she had \"refrained her tongue, and kept silence,\" though probably with some difficulty. Now she can endure no longer. To see her husband so afflicted, and so patient under his afflictions, is more than she can bear. Her mind is weak and ill regulated, and she suffers herself to become Satan's ally and her husband's worst enemy. It is noticeable that she urges her husband to do exactly that which Satan had suggested that he would do (Job 1:11; Job 2:5), and had evidently wished him to do, thus fighting on his side, and increasing her husband's difficulties The only other mention of her (Job 19:17) implies that she was rather a hindrance than a help to Job. Curse God, and die; i.e. \"renounce God, put all regard for him away from thee, even though he kill thee for so doing.\" Job's wife implies that death is preferable to such a life as Job now leads and must expect to lead henceforward.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh; rather, as one of the vile (or impious) women speaketh. Nabal, the term used, is expressive, not of mere natural folly, but of that perversion of the intellect which comes on men when their hearts and understandings are corrupted and degraded.. (see 2 Samuel 13:13; Psalm 14:1; Isaiah 32:6). What? shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil? Job remembers all the good which he has received of God during his past life, all the blessings and prosperity bestowed on him (Job 1:2, 3), and asks - Would it be fair or right to take all the good things as a matter of course, and then to murmur if evil things are sent? He accepts both prosperity and affliction as coming from God, and expresses himself as willing to submit to his will. But he has, perhaps, scarcely attained to the conviction that whatever God sends to his faithful servants is always that which is best for them - that afflictions, in fact, are blessings in disguise, and ought to be received with gratitude, not with murmuring (comp. Hebrews 12:5-11). In all this did not Job sin with his lips. Thus far, that is, Job \"kept the door of his mouth\" strictly, righteously, piously. Later on he was not always so entirely free from fault.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him. It is not to be supposed that Job had no more than three friends - indeed, Elihu the Buzzite appears later on as one of his friends (Job 32:2-6) - but he had three contemporaries with whom he was especially intimate, old men (Job 32:6), with whom he was probably accustomed to confer from time to time, and who were in the habit of giving him their advice. All three, apparently, lived at a distance; and it seems to have been some weeks before the news of his misfortunes reached them. When the news came they held communication one with another, and agreed to pay him visits of condolence at a certain definite time, which was determined upon between them. Some months - at least two - seem to have elapsed between the date of Job's latest affliction and the time of their arrival (Job 7:3). They came every one from his own place. They had separate homes, and probably lived at some considerable distance from one another. Eliphaz the Temanite. There was an Eliphaz, the son of Esau by his wife Adah, who had a son Teman (Genesis 36:4; 1 Chronicles 1:35, 36); but it is not supposed that this can be the person here intended. The name Teman did not become geographical until the descendants of this Eliphaz's son had multiplied into a tribe, when they gave name to the portion of Arabia which they inhabited. This tract seems to have been either a part of Edom, or in its immediate vicinity (Genesis 36:42, 43; Jeremiah 49:7, 8, 20; Ezekiel 25:15; Obadiah 1:8, 9), but cannot be located with accuracy. The Temanitee were celebrated for their wisdom, as we learn from Jeremiah, who says (Jeremiah 49:7), \"Concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?\" Job's friend was probably among their wisest men at the time; and his discourses certainly show a considerable knowledge of human nature. They do not, however, solve the riddle of the universe. And Bildad the Shuhite. Bildad is a name which does not occur elsewhere in Scripture, neither is there any other mention of Shuhites. Conjecture has identified the Shuhites with the Saccaei of Ptolemy ('Geograph.,' 5:15), whom he places in the neighbourhood of Batanaea and Trachonitis. But the Saccaei are unheard of till Ptolemy's time, and seem to be a tribe of very small importance. Perhaps Bildad belonged to the people known to the Assyrians as the Tsukhi, or Sukhi ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 14), who dwelt on the Middle Euphrates from about Anah to Hit ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 66, 67). And Zophar the Naamathite. Zophar, or rather Tsophar, is another unknown name. There was a Naamah, a city, in south-western Judaea (Joshua 15:41), to which Zophar may have belonged, though probably a region, rather than a city, is here intended. For they had made an appointment together; or, agreed together, by message or letter probably. To come to mourn with him and to comfort him. A good intention, at any rate, and one agreeable to the apostolic injunction to us to \"weep with them that weep\" (Romans 12:15). That they failed to carry out their intention (Job 16:2; Job 21:34) was owing to a want of judgment, and, perhaps, in part, to a want of love.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not. Job was seated on an ash-heap outside his dwelling (ver. 8). The three friends, who had probably met by agreement at some point near his residence, and drew nigh together, saw the figure at some distance, and looked to see who it was. But Job was so disfigured by the disease that they failed to recognize him. They lifted up their voice, and wept. In the clamorous manner of Orientals (comp. Herod., 2:14; 3:119; 8:99; 9:24; and AEschylus, 'Persae\" passim). And they rent every one his mantle (see the comment on Job 1:20), and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven (comp. Joshua 7:6; 1 Samuel 4:12; 2 Samuel 1:2; 2 Samuel 13:19; Nehemiah 9:1; Ezekiel 27:30; Lamentations 2:10; and see also Homer, 'I1,' 18:22-24; Helioder, ' Hist. Æth.; 1.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights. Professor Lee supposes that this is not to be taken literally. \"It means\" he says, \"that they sat with him a considerable length of time before they opened the question discussed in this book, not that they sat precisely seven days and seven nights, and said not so much as one word to him\" ('The Book of the Patriarch Job; p. 194). But the period of\" seven days\" was appropriate to mournings (Genesis 1:10 2Samuel 31:13 Ezekiel 3:15), and if they could stay with him one day and one night without speaking, why not seven? Food would be brought them, and they might sleep rolled up in their begeds. The long silence may be accounted for by the fact that \"among the Jews,\" and among Orientals generally, \"it is a point of decorum, and one dictated by a fine and true feeling, not to speak to a person in deep affliction until he gives an intimation of a desire to be comforted\" (Cook). So long as Job kept silence they had to keep silence, at least so far as he was concerned. They might speak to any attendants who drew near, and they might speak one to another. Note the words which follow: And none spake a word unto him None spake to him; but no etiquette imposed complete silence on them. For they saw that his grief was very great. So great that he could not as yet bear to be spoken to.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-31. - The contrast is now completed. Having drawn the portrait of himself as he was, rich, honoured, blessed with children, flourishing, in favour with both God and man, Job now presents himself to us as he is, despised of men (vers. 1-10), afflicted of God (ver. 11), a prey to vague terrors (ver. 15), tortured with bodily pains (vers. 17, 18), cast off by God (vers. 19, 20), with nothing but death to look for (vers. 23-31). The chapter is the most touching in the whole book. Verse 1. - But now they that are younger than I have me in derision. As Job had been speaking last of the honour in which he was once held, he beans his contrast by chewing how at present he is disgraced and derided. Men who are outcasts and solitary themselves, poor dwellers in caves (ver. 6), who have much ado to keep body and soul together (vers. 3, 4), and not men only but youths, mere boys, scoff at him, make him a song and a byword (ver. 9). nay, \"spare not to spit in his face\" (ver. 10). There seem to have been in his vicinity weak and debased tribes, generally contemned and looked down upon, regarded as thieves (ver. 5) by their neighbours, and considered to be of base and vile origin (ver. 8), who saw in Job's calamities a rare opportunity for insulting and triumphing over a member of the superior race which had crushed them, and thus tasting, to a certain extent, the sweetness of revenge. Whose fathers I would have disdained (rather, I disdained) to have set with the dogs of my flock. Job had not thought their fathers worthy of employing even as the lowest class of herdsmen, those reckoned on a par with the sheep-dogs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Yes, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me? Men, who had no such strength in their hands as to yield an employer any profit - poor, weak creatures, in whom old age (rather, manly vigour) was perished. An effete race seems to be pointed at, without strength or stamina, nerveless, spiritless, \"destined to early decay and premature death;\" but how they had sunk into such a condition is not apparent. Too often such remanents are merely tribes physically weak, whom more powerful ones have starved and stunted, driving them into the least productive regions, and in every way making life hard for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For want and famine they were solitary; rather, they were gaunt (see the Revised Version). Compare the descriptions given to us of the native races of Central Africa by Sir S. Baker, Speke, Grant, Stanley, and others. Fleeing into the wilderness; rather, gnawing the wilderness; i.e. feeding on such dry and sapless roots and fruits as the wilderness produces. In former time desolate and waste; or, on the eve of wasteness and desolation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Who cut up mallows by the bushes. One of the plants on which they feed is the malluch, not really a \"mallow,\" but probably the Atriplex halimus which is \"a shrub from four to five feet high, with many thick branches; the leaves are rather sour to the taste; the flowers are purple, and very small; it grows on the sea-coast in Greece, Arabia, Syria, etc., and belongs to the natural order Chenopodiace\" (see Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 215). And juniper roots for their meat. Most moderns regard the rothen as the Genista monosperma, which is a kind of broom. It is a leguminous plant, having a white flower. and grows plentifully in the Sinaitic desert, in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia. The root is very bitter, and would only be used as food under extreme pressure, but the fruit is readily eaten by sheep, and the roots would, no doubt, yield some nourishment (see Dr. Cunningham Geikie's work,' The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 258).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They were driven forth from among men. Weak races retreat before strong ones, who occupy their lands, and whose will they do not dare to dispute. They are not intentionally \"driven out,\" for the strong raecs would gladly make them their drudges; but they retire into the most inaccessible regions, as the primitive population has done in India and elsewhere. They cried after them as after a thief. Outcast tribes naturally, and almost necessarily, become robber-tribes. Deprived of their productive lands, and driven into rocky deserts, want makes them thieves and marauders. Then those who have made them what they are vilify and decry them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - To dwell in the cliffs cf. the valleys; of in the clefts (Revised Version). Western Asia is full of rocky regions, seamed with deep gorges and clefts, the walls of which rise abruptly or in terraces, and are themselves pierced with caves and cracks. The tract about Petra is, perhaps, the most remarkable of these regions; but there are many others which closely resemble it. These places afford refuges to weak and outcast tribes, who hide in them, either in caves of the earth, or in the rocks. The Greeks called these unfortunates \"Troglodytes\"(Herod., 4:183; Strabo, 16. p. 1102; Diod. Sic., 3:14.etc.), the Hebrews \"Horim,\" from חור \"a hole.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmong the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Among the bushes they brayed. The sounds which came from their mouths sounded to Job less like articulate speech than like the braying of asses. Compare what Herodotus says of his Troglodytes: \"Their language is unlike that of any other people; it sounds like the screeching of bats.\" Under the nettles (or, wild vetches) they were gathered together; rather, huddled together.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They were children of fools. The physical degeneracy whereof Job has been speaking is accompanied in most instances by extreme mental incapacity. Some of the degraded races cannot count beyond four or five; others have not more than two or three hundred words in their vocabulary. They are all of low intellect, though occasionally extremely artful and cunning. Yea, children of base men; literally, children of no name. Their race had never made for itself any name, but was unknown and insignificant. They were viler than the earth; rather, they were scourged out of the land. This must not be understood literally. It is a rhetorical repetition of what had been already said in ver. 5. The expression may be compared with the tale in Herodotus, that when the Scythian slaves rebelled and took up arms, the Scythians scourged them into subjection (Herod., 4:3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword (see above, Job 17:6; and comp.

And spare not to spit in my face. This has generally been taken literally, as it seems to have been by the LXX. But it, perhaps, means no more than that they did not refrain from spitting in Job's presence (see Professor Lee's ' Book of Job,' p. 422).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Because he hath loosed my cord. \"He,\" in this passage, can only be God; and thus Job turns here to some extent from his human persecutors to his great Afflicter, the Almighty. God has \"loosened his cord\" i.e. has relaxed his vital fibre, taken away his strength, reduced him to helplessness. Hence, and hence only, do the persecutors dare to crowd around him and insult him. And afflicted me. God has afflicted him with blow after blow - with impoverishment (Job 1:14-17), with bereavement (Job 1:18, 19), with a sore malady (Job 2:7). They have also let loose the bridle before me. This has given his persecutors the courage to east aside all restraint, and lead him with insult after insult (vers. 1, 9, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Upon my right hand rise the youth; literally, the brood; i.e. the rabble - a crowd of half-grown youths and boys, such as collects in almost any town to hoot and insult a respectable person who is in trouble and helpless. In the East such gatherings are very common and exceedingly annoying. They push away my feet; i.e. they try to throw me down as I walk. They raise up against me the ways of their destruction. They place obstacles in my way, impede my steps, thwart me in every way that they find possible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They mar my path; i.e. interfere with and frustrate whatever I am bent on doing. They set forward my calamity, Professor Lee translates, \"They profit by my ruin.\" They have no helper. If the text is sound, we must understand, \"They do all this, they dare all this, even though they have no powerful men to aid them.\" But it is suspected that there is some corruption in the passage, and that the original gave the sense which is found in the Vulgate,\" There is none to help me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters; i.e. with a force like that of water when it has burst through a bank or dam. In the desolation they relied themselves upon me. Like the waves of the sea, which follow one after another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTerrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Terrors are turned upon me Job seems to pass here from his human persecutors to his internal sufferings of mind and body. \"Terrors' take hold upon him. He experiences in his sleep horrible dreams and visions (see Job 7:14), and even in his waking hours he is haunted by fears. The \"terrors of God do set themselves in array against him\" (Job 6:4). God seems to him as One that watches, and \"tries him every moment\" (Job 7:18), seeking occasion against him, and never leaving him an instant's peace (Job 7:19). These terrors, he says, pursue my soul as the wind; literally, pursue mine honour, or my dignity. They flutter the calm composure that befits a godly man, disturb it, shake it, and for a time at any rate, cause terrors and shrinkings of soul. Under these circumstances, my welfare passeth away as a cloud. It is not only my happiness, but my real welfare, that is gone. Body and soul are equally in suffering - the one shaken with fears and disturbed with doubts and apprehensions; the other smitten with a sore disease, so that there is no soundness in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And now my soul is poured out upon me (comp. Psalm 42:4). My very soul seems to be gone out of me. \"I faint and swoon away, because of my fears\" (Lee). The days of affliction have taken hold upon me. All my prosperity is gone, and I am come to \"the days of affliction.\" These \"take hold on me,\" and, as it were, possess me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - My bones are pierced in me in the night season. In Elephantiasis anaesthetics says Dr. Erasmus Wilson, \"when the integument is insensible, there are deep-seated burning pains, sometimes of a bone or joint, and sometimes of the vertebral column. These pains are greatest at night; they prevent sleep, and give rise to restless,less and frightful dreams\" (Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1. p. 817). And my sinews take no rest; rather, my gnawings, or my gnawing pains (see the Revised Version; and comp. ver. 3, where the same word is properly rendered by \"gnawing [the wilderness]\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - By the great force of my disease is my garment changed; or, disfigured. The purulent discharge from his ulcers disfigured and made filthy his garment, which stiffened as the discharge dried, and clung to his frame. It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. The whole garment clung to his body as closely as it is usual for a mall's collar, or \"neck-hole\" (Professor Lee), to cling about his throat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He (i.e. God) hath cast me into the mire. \"The mire\" here is the lowest depth of misery and degradation (comp. Psalm 40:2; Psalm 69:2, 14). Job feels himself cast into it by God, but nevertheless does not forsake him nor cease to call upon him (vers. 20-23). And I am become like dust and ashes; i.e. unclean, impure, offensive to my fellow-men, an object of dislike and disdain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me. It is the worst of all calamities to be God-forsaken, as Job believed himself to be, because he had no immediate answer to his prayers. The bitterest cry upon the cross was \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\" But no good man is ever really God-forsaken, and no rightful and earnest prayers are ever really unheard. Job \"had need of patience\" (Hebrews 10:36), patient as he was (James 5:11). He should have trusted God more, and complained less. I stand up, and thou regardest me not; rather, I stand up, as the manner of the Jews usually was in prayer (Luke 18:11), and thou lookest at me (see the Revised Version). Job's complaint is that, when he stands up and stretches out his hands to God in prayer, God simply looks on, does nothing, gives him no help.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thou art become cruel to me; literally, thou art turned to be cruel to me. In other words, \"Thou art changed to me, and art become cruel to me.\" Job never forgets that for long years God was gracious and kind to him, \"made him and fashioned him together round about,\" \"clothed him with skin and flesh, and fenced him with bones and sinews,\" \"granted him life and favour, and by his visitation preserved his spirit\" (Job 10:9-12); but the recollection brings, perhaps, as much of pain. as of pleasure with it. One of our poets says -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Joy's recollection is no longer joy;NEWLINEBut sorrow's memory is a sorrow still.\" At any rate, the contrast between past joy and present suffering adds a pang to the latter. With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me; literally, with the might of thy hand dost thou persecute me (see the Revised Version). \"Haec noster irreverentius\" (Schultens); comp. ch. 19:6-13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou tensest me to ride upon it; i.e. thou makest me to be storm-tossed. I am as it were a straw caught up by a whirlwind, and borne hither and thither in the wide regions of space, unknowing whither I go. I am treated as I have described the wicked man to be treated (Job 27:20, 21). And dissolvest my substance. \"Dissolvest me entirely\" (Professor Lee); dissolvest me in the storms (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For I know that thou wilt bring me to death. Job has all along expressed his conviction that he has nothing to look for but death. He feels within himself the seeds of a mortal malady; for such, practically, was elephantiasis in Job's time. He is devoid of any expectation of recovery. Death must come upon him, he thinks, ere long; and then God will bring him to the house appointed for all living. This, as he has already explained (Job 10:21, 22), is \"the land of darkness and the shadow of death, a land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.\" It is a melancholy prospect; but we must regard it as cheered by the hope of an ultimate resurrection, such as seems indicated, if not absolutely proclaimed, in Job 19:25-27 (see the comment on that passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. This is one of the most obscure passages in the entire Book of Job, and scarcely any two independent commentators understand it alike. To give all the different renderings, and discuss them, would be an almost endless task, and one over-wearisome to the reader. It will, per-Imps, suffice to select the one which to the present writer appears the most satisfactory. This is the rendering of Professor Stanley Leathes, who suggests the following: \"Howbeit God will not put forth his hand to bring a man to death and the grave, when there is earnest prayer for them, not even when he himself hath caused the calamity.\" The same writer further explains the passage as follows: \"I know that thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave (ver. 23), though thou wilt not do so when I pray to thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so [some time or other], but not in my time, or according to my will, but only in thine own appointed time, and as thou seest fit.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDid not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? i.e. do I claim a sympathy which I do not deserve? When men wept and entreated me, did not I do my best to give them the aid which they requested? Did not I weep for them, and intercede with God for them? Was not my soul grieved for the poor? (comp. Job 29:12-17; Job 31:16-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - When I looked for flood, then evil came unto me. Job was \"looking for good,\" expecting fully the continuance of his great wealth and prosperity, when the sudden shock of calamity fell upon him It was wholly unexpected, and therefore the harder to bear. And when I waited for light, there came darkness. This may refer to periods, after his calamities began, when he had hopes that his prayers would be answered, and a rest or pause, an interval of repose, be granted him (Job 9:34; Job 10:20), but when his hopes were disappointed, and the darkness closed in upon him thicker and murkier than ever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - My bowels boiled, and rested not; rather, boil and rest not (see the Revised Version). It is his present condition of which Job speaks from ver. 27 to ver. 31. His \"entrails,\" i.e. his whole innermost nature, is disturbed, tormented, thrown into confusion. The days of affliction prevented me; rather, are come upon me (comp. ver. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28, 29. - I went mourning without the sun; rather, I go about blackened, but not by the sun. Grief and suffering, according to Oriental notions, blackened the face (see Lamentations 4:8; Lamentations 5:10; Psalm 119:83; and below, ver. 30). I stood up, and I cried in the congregation; rather, I stand up in the assembly and cry for help (see the Revised Version). Job feels this as the most pitiable feature in his ease. He is broken down; he can no longer endure. At first he could sit in silence for seven days (Job 2:13); now he is reduced to uttering complaints and lamentations. He is a brother, not to dragons, but to jackals. His laments are like the long melancholy cries that those animals emit during the silence of the night, so well known to Eastern travellers. He adds further that he is a companion, not to owls, but to ostriches; which, like jackals, have a melancholy cry (see Micah 1:8; and comp. Dr. Hooker's article in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 650).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - My skin is black upon me (see the comment on vers. 28, 29, ad init.), and my bones are burned with heat. The \"burning pains\" in the bones, which characterize at least one form of elephantiasis, have been already mentioned (see the comment on ver. 17). In ordinary elephantiasis there is often \"intense pain in the lumbar region and groin,\" which the patient might think to be in his bones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob30:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - My harp also is turned to mourning. The result of all is that Job's harp is laid aside, either literally or figuratively. Its music is replaced by the sound of mourning (see vers. 28, 29). And my organ (or rather, my pipe) into the voice of them that weep. The pipe also is no longer sounded in his presence; he hears only the voice of weeping and lamentation. Thus appropriately ends the long dirge in which he has bewailed his miserable fare.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I made a covenant with mine eyes; rather, for mine eyes. The covenant must have been with himself. Job means that be came to a fixed resolution, by which he thenceforth guided his conduct, not even to \"look upon a woman to lust after her\" (Matthew 5:28). We must suppose this resolution come to in his early youth, when the passions are strongest, and when so many men go astray. How then should I look upon a maid! Having made such a resolution, how could I possibly break it by \"looking upon a maid\"? Job assumes that he could not be so weak as to break a solemn resolution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For what portion of God is there from above? The meaning seems to be, \"For what portion in God would there be to me from above, if I were so to act?\" i.e. if I were secretly to nurse and indulge my lusts. Impurity, perhaps, more than any other sin, cuts off from God, who is \"of purer eyes than to behold iniquity\" (Habakkuk 1:13). And what inheritance of the Almighty from on high! What should I inherit, i.e. what should I receive, from on high, if I were so sinful? The next verse gives the answer,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Is not destruction to the wicked? The inheritance of the wicked is \"destruction\" - ruin both of soul and body. This is what I should have to expect if I yielded myself to the bondage of lust and concupiscence. And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? The rare word neker (גכר), translated here by \"strange punishment,\" seems to mean \"alienation from God\" - being turned from God's friend into his enemy (comp. Buxtorf, 'Lexicon Hebraicum et Chaldaicum,' who explains גכר by \"alienatio;\" and the comment of Schultens on Job 31:3, \"Necer, a Deo alienatio\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

Comp. also Psalm 139:3; Proverbs 5:21; Proverbs 15:3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit. \"If I have been a living lie, i.e. if, under a fair show of piety and righteousness of life, I have, as you my friends suppose, been all along a deceiver and a hypocrite, cloaking my secret sins under a mere pretence of well-doing, then the sooner I am exposed the better. Let me be weighed,\" etc. The painful suggestion of hypocrisy has been made by Job's friends repeatedly during the colloquy (Job 4:7-9; Job 8:6, 12; Job 11:4-6, '11-14; 15:30-35; 18:5-21; 20:5-29, etc.), and has deeply afflicted the patriarch. It is a charge so easily made, and so impossible to refute. All that the righteous man, thus falsely accused, can do is to appeal to God: \"Thou, God, knowest. Thou, God, wilt one day show forth the truth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let me be weighed in an even balance; literally, let him (i.e. God) weigh me in the balances of justice. The use of this imagery by the Egyptians has been already noted (see the comment on Job 6:2). It is an essential part of every Egyptian representation of the final judgment of souls by Osiris. Each man's merits are formally weighed in a balance, which is carefully depicted, and he is judged accordingly. Job asks that this may be done in his case, either immediately or at any rate ultimately. He would have the act performed, that God may know his integrity; or rather, may recognize it. (So Professor Leo.) Job has no doubt that a thorough investigation of his case will lead to a, acknowledgment and proclamation of his innocence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - If my step hath turned out of the way. If; i.e., I have at any time knowingly and voluntarily departed from the way of thy commandments, as made known to me either by godly men or by thy law written in my heart, then let the consequences follow that are mentioned in the next verse. Or if mine heart hath walked after mine eyes, and if consequently any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; i.e. if I have been guilty of any plain act of sin. It is to be remembered that Job has the testimony of God himself to the fact that he was \"a perfect and an upright man, one that feared God, and eschewed evil (Job 2:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Then let me sow, and let another eat (comp. Job 5:5; Leviticus 26:16; Deuteronomy 28:33, 51, etc.). The expression is proverbial. Yea, lot my offspring be rooted out; rather, my produce, or the produce of my field (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If mine heart have been deceived by a woman; rather, enticed, or allured unto a woman. If, that is, I have suffered myself at any time to be enticed by the wiles of a \"strange woman\" (Proverbs 5:3; Proverbs 6:24, etc.), and have so far yielded as to go after her; and if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door - watching for an opportunity to enter unseen, while the goodman is away (Proverbs 7:19) Job is not speaking of what he has done, but of what men may suspect him of having done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Then let my wife grind unto another; i.e. \"let the wife of my bosom be brought so low as to be compelled to do the servile work of grinding the corn in the household of another woman.\" The condition of the female slaves who ground the corn was regarded as the lowest point in domestic slavery (see Exodus 11:5; Isaiah 47:2). And let others bow down upon her. Let them, i.e., claim the master's right, and reduce her to the extremest degradation There would be a just nemesis in this punishment of an adulterer (see 2 Samuel 12:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For this is an heinous crime. The crime of adultery subverts the family relation, on which it has pleased God to erect the entire fabric of human society. Hence, in the Jewish Law, adultery was made a capital offence (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22), both in the woman and in the man. Among other nations the adulteress was commonly punished with death, but the adulterer escaped scot-free. In modern communities adultery is mostly regarded, not as a crime, but as a civil wrong, on account of which an action lies against the adulterer. It is an iniquity to be punished by the judges; literally, it is an iniquity of judges; i.e. one of which judges take cognizance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction; i.e. it is a thing which brings down the wrath of God upon a man, so that \"a fire is kindled in his anger, which shall burn unto the lowest hell\" (Deuteronomy 32:22). Compare the sentence on David for his great transgression (2 Samuel 12:9-12). And would root out all mine increase; i.e. \"would destroy all my estate;\" either by leading me to waste my substance upon my companion in sin, or by bringing down God's judgments upon me to my temporal ruin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant. Job now disclaims a fourth sin - the oppression of his dependants. Eliphaz had taxed him generally with harshness and cruelty in his relations towards those weaker than himself (Job 22:5-9), but had not specially pointed to this kind of oppressiveness. As, however, this was the commonest form of the vice, Job deems it right to disclaim it, before addressing himself to the several charges brought by Eliphaz. He has not ill used his slaves, either male or female. He has not \"despised their cause,\" but given it full consideration and attention; he has heard them when they contended with him; he has allowed them to \"contend;\" he has been a just, and not a hard master. The slavery of which he speaks is evidently of a kind under which the slave had certain rights, as was the case also under the Mosaic Law (Exodus 21:2-11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - What then shall I do when God riseth up? Job regards God as the Avenger and Champion of all the oppressed. If he had been harsh and cruel to his dependants, he would have provoked God's anger, and God would assuredly \"rise up\" one day to punish. What, then, could he (Job) do? What but submit in silence? When he visiteth, what shall I answer him? There could be no valid defence. The slave was still a man, a brother - God's creature, equally with his master. Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? God \"hath made of one Mood all nations of men,\" and all individual me, \"to dwell on the face of the earth\" (Acts 17:26). All have rights - in a certain sense, equal rights. All are entitled to just treatment, to kind treatment, to merciful treatment. Job is before his age in recognizing the substantial equality of the slave with the freeman, which otherwise was scarcely taught by any until the promulgation of the gospel (see 1 Timothy 6:2; Philemon 1:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDid not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - If I have withheld the poor from their desire. As Eliphaz had maintained (Job 22:6, 7), and as Job had already denied (Job 29:12, 16). The duty of relieving the poor, solemnly enjoined upon the people of Israel in the Law (Deuteronomy 15:7-11), was generally admitted by the civilized nations of antiquity. In Egypt it was especially insisted on. \"The Egyptian's duties to mankind,\" says Dr. Birch, \"were comprised in giving bread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, oil to the wounded, and burial to the dead\" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 46). Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail. \"Thou hast sent widows away empty,\" was one of the accusations of Eliphaz (Job 22:9). \"I caused the widow's heart,\" replied Job, \"to sing for joy\" (Job 29:13). The widow's weakness has always been felt to give her a special claim on man's benevolence (see Exodus 22:22; Deuteronomy 14:29; Deuteronomy 16:11, 14; Deuteronomy 24:19; Deuteronomy 26:12, 13; Psalm 146:9; Proverbs 15:25; Isaiah 1:17; Jeremiah 7:6; Malachi 3:5; 1 Timothy 5:16; James 1:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof. With the widow, the fatherless is usually conjoined, as an equal object of compassion (see Exodus 22:22; Deuteronomy 10:18; Psalm 68:5; Isaiah 1:17; Jeremiah 22:3; Ezekiel 22:7; Zechariah 7:10, etc.). Eliphaz had specially charged Job with oppression of the fatherless (Job 22:9), and his charge had been denied by Job (Job 29:12). He now claims to have always shared his bread with orphans, and made them partakers or his abundance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb; i.e. I have always, so long as I can remember, protected the orphan and done my best to help the widow. It has been my habit from my earliest years so to act. The language is exaggerated; but it had, no doubt, a basis of fact to rest upon. Job was brought up in these principles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If I have seen any perish for want of clothing (scrap. Job 22:6, where Eliphaz taxes Job with so acting; and, on the duty of clothing the naked, see Isaiah 58:7; Ezekiel 18:7, 16; Matthew 25:36). Or any poor without covering. A pleonastic parallelism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - If his loins have not blessed me (see above, Job 29:11, 13), and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep. Clothed, i.e., with a garment spun from wool yielded by my own sheep. A great sheikh like Job would keep in store many such garments, ready to be given to such as were naked or poorly clad, when they came under his observation (Isaiah 58:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless; i.e. if I have in any way oppressed him. When I saw my help in the gate; i.e.. when I had the power to do so - when I saw my friends and hangers-on mustered in force at the gate where causes were being tried. The wrong and robbery which the poor suffer in the East have always been camel, to a large extent, by failure of justice in the courts, where might, and not right, carries the day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Then let mine arm (rather, my shoulder) fall from my shoulder-blade. Job was, perhaps, led to make this rather strange imprecation by the fact that, in the disease from which he was suffering, portions of bone sometimes detach themselves and come away. And mine arm be broken from the bone. My forearm, i.e, detach itself from the bone of the upper arm, and come away from it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For destruction from God was a terror to me. I could not, i.e., have acted in the way charged against me by Eliphaz, since I was always God-fearing, and should have been deterred, if by nothing else, at any rate by dread of the Divine vengeance. And by reason of his highness I could not endure. God's majesty and excellency are such that I could not have had the face to resist them. If! had begun such a course of life as Eliphaz laid to my charge (Job 22:5-9), I could not have persisted in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - If I have made gold my hope. This is a sin with which the patriarch had not been directly charged. But it had been more or less insinuated (see Job 15:28; Job 20:10, 15, 19; Job 22:24, etc.). He may also, perhaps, have felt some inclination to it. Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence. (On the wicked man's trust in riches, see Psalm 49:6; Psalm 52:7; Psalm 62:10; Mark 10:24; Luke 12:16-19.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much. Job feels that it is wrong even to care greatly for wealth. He seems almost to anticipate the saying of St. Paul, that \"covetousness is idolatry\" (Colossians 3:5); and hence he passes on without pause from this sort of creature-worship to others common in his day (vers. 26, 27). which he likewise disclaims.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - If I beheld the sun when it shined; literally, the light; i.e. the great light, which God made to rule the day (Genesis 1:16). Sun-worship, the least ignoble form of idolatry, was widely spread in the East, and in Egypt, from a very early date. According to the views of some, the religion el' t e Egyptians was little else than a complicated sun-worship from its earliest inception to its very latest phase. \"The religious notions of the Egyptians,\" says Dr. Birch, \"were chiefly connected with the worship of the sun, with whom at a later period all the principal deities were connected. As Hag, or Harmachis, he represented the youthful or rising sun; as Ra, the midday; and as Turn. the setting sun. According to Egyptian notions, that god floated in a boat through the sky or celestial ether, and descended to the dark regions of night, or Hades. Many deities attended on his passage or were connected with his worship, and the gods Amen and Khepr, who represented the invisible and self-produced god, were identified with the sun\" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' Introduction, pp. 9, 10.). Even those who do not go these lengths admit that the solar worship was, at any rate, a very main element in the cult of Egypt (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 342-364). In the Babylonian and Assyrian religion the position of the sun-god was leas prominent, but still, as San, or Shamas, he held an important place, and was the main object of religious veneration to a largo body of worshippers ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 126-128; vol. 2. pp. 17, 18). In the Vedic system the sun figured as Mitra, and in the Zoroastrian as Mithra, in both holding a high position. Among the Arabians the sun, worshipped as Orotal, is said to have been anciently the only god, though he was accompanied by a female principle named Alilat (Herod., 3:8). Or the moon walking in brightness. The worship of the moon has. in most countries where it has prevailed, been quite secondary and subordinate to that of the sun. In Egypt. while nine gods are more or less identified with the solar luminary, two only, Khons and Thoth, can be said to represent the moon. In the Vedic and Zoroastrian systems the moon, called Soma, or Hems, almost dropped out of the popular religion, at any rate as a moon-god. In the Arabiun, Alilat, a goddess, probably represented the moon, as did Ashtoreth, a goddess, in the Pheonician. In Assyria, however, and in Babylonia, moon-worship held a higher position, Sin, the moon-god, taking precedence over Shamas, the sun-god, and being a very much more important personage (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 123-126; vol. 2. pp. 16, 17). Thus both moon-worship and sun-worship were prevalent among all, or almost all, Job's neighbours.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand. The sin of the heart is placed first, as the fens et origo mali the spiritual root of the matter. On this naturally follows the outward act which, in the case of idolatry, was commonly the act exactly expressed by the word \"adore\" - the movement of the hand to the mouth in token of reverence and honour (see Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 28:2, \"Inter adorandum dexteram ad osculum referimus, et totum corpus circumagimus;\" and Minucius Felix, Octav., 2, Caecilius, simulacro Serapidis denotato, ut vulgus superstitiosum solet, manum ori admovens osculum labiis pressit\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge (see the comment on ver. 11, adfin.). It is rightly concluded from this expression that, in the country and age of Job, the sort of idolatry which is here mentioned was practised by some, and also that it was legally punishable. For I should have denied the God that is above. The worship of any other god besides the supreme God is, practically, atheism, since \"no man can serve two masters.\" Moreover, to set up two independent gods is to destroy the idea of God, which implies supremacy over every other being.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me. \"If at any time I was malevolent, if I wished evil to others, and rejoiced when evil came upon them, being (as the Greeks expressed it) ἐπιχαιρέκακος - if I so acted even in the case of my enemy - then,\" etc. The apodosis is wanting, but may be supplied by any suitable imprecation (see vers. 8, 10, 22, 40). Or lifted up myself - i.e. was puffed up and exalted - when evil found him. In the old world men generally regarded themselves as fully entitled to exult at the downfall of an enemy, and to triumph over him with words of contumely and scorn (camp. Judges 5:19-31; Psalm 18:37-42; Isaiah 10:8-1.4, etc.). There appears to be but one other passage in the Old Testament, besides the present, in which the contrary disposition is shown. This is Proverbs 17:5, where the writer declares that \"he who is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. Much less, Job means, have I gone beyond the thought to the word, and imprecated a curse upon him with my mouth, as the manner of most hen is towards their enemies (see 2 Samuel 16:5; 1 Samuel 17:43; Nehemiah 13:25; Psalm 109:28; Jeremiah 15:10, etc).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - If the men of my tent said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. A very obscure passage, but probably to be connected with the following verse, in which Job boasts of his hospitality. Translate, If the men of my tent did not say, Who can find a man that has not been satisfied with his meat? The apodosis is wanting, as in ver. 28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The stranger did not lodge in the street; i.e. \"I did not suffer any stranger who came under my notice to lodge in the street, but, like Abraham (Genesis 18:2-8), went out to him, and invited him in, to partake of my hospitality.\" This is still the practice of Arab sheikhs in Syria, Palestine, and the adjacent countries (see Dr. Cunningham Geikie's 'Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 283). But I opened my doors to the traveller; literally, to the way; i.e. \"my house gave on the street, and I kept my house door open.\" Compare the Mishna, \"Let thy house be open to the street\" ('Pirke Aboth,' § 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - If I covered my transgressions as Adam; or, after the manner of men It does not seem to me likely that Job had such a knowledge of Adam's conduct in the garden of Eden as would have made an allusion to it in this place natural or probable. The religious traditions of the Chaldees, which note the war in heaven, the Deluge, the building of the Tower of Babel, and the confusion of tongues, contain no mention of Adam or of Paradise. Nor. so far as I am aware, is there, among other ancient legends, any near parallel to the story of the Fall as related in Genesis 4. Much less does the subordinate detail of Adam hiding himself make its appearance in any of them. The marginal rendering, \"after the manner of men,\" is therefore, I think, to be preferred. By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom. This is not particularly apposite to the case of Adam, who \"hid himself from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden\" (Genesis 4:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDid I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Did I fear a great multitude! rather, because I feared the great multitude or the great assembly; i.e. the gathering of the people in the gate on occasions of public business. It' Job had been conscious of any great and heinous sins' he would not have led the open and public life which, previously to his calamities, he had always led (Job 29:7-10, 21-25); he would have been afraid to make his appearance at public meetings, lest his sins should have become known, and should draw upon him scorn and contempt, instead of the respect and acclamations to which he was accustomed. Or did the contempt of families terrify me? rather, and the contempt of families terrified me. The contempt of the assembled tribes and families, which might have been poured out upon him at such meetings, would have been quite sufficient to prevent his attending them. If by any accident he had found himself at one, and had seen that he was looked upon with disfavour, he must have kept silence in order to avoid observation. Prudence would have counselled that more complete abstention which is implied in the phrase, and went not out of the door; i.e. \"stayed at home in mine own house.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Oh that one would hear me! i.e. Oh that I had an opportunity of plea, ling my cause before a just judge l of having charges openly brought against me, and having \"one\" to hear my reply to them! Job does not regard his \"comforters\" as such persons. They are prejudiced; they have even made themselves his accusers. Behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me; rather, behold here is my signature I let the Almighty answer me. This passage is parenthetic. Job would prefer to be judged by God, if it were possible, and therefore throws out the wish. Here is his plea in ch. 29-31; and here is his attestation by word of mouth, which is equivalent to his signature. And that mine adversary had written a book; or, had penned an indictment against me. Job would have matters brought to an issue. In default of a Divine trial and sentence, which he cannot expect, it would suffice tot him that his arraigner should formally draw out his list of charges, and present him with a copy, and so give him an opportunity of making answer to it. If this were done, then (he says) -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Surely I would take it upon my shoulder - the place of honour (see Isaiah 9:6; Isaiah 22:22) - and bind it as a crown to me; i.e. adorn my head with it, as with a diadem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - I would declare unto him the number of my steps; i.e. I would conceal nothing. I would willingly divulge every act of my life. I would make full and complete answer to the indictment in every particular. As a prince would I go near unto him. There should be no timidity or cringing on my part. I would face my accuser boldly, and bear myself as a prince in his presence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38-40. - It is generally supposed that these verses, with the exception of the last clause of ver. 40, are misplaced. As a termination, they form an anti-climax, and greatly weaken the peroration. Their proper place would seem to be between vers. 32 and 33. Verse 38. - If my land cry against me; i.e. if my land disclaim my ownership, as having been acquired by wrong or robbery. If the furrows likewise thereof complain; or, weep, as having been torn from their rightful proprietors, and seized by a stranger. The apodosis is in ver. 40.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money; i.e. without acquiring a title to them by purchase. Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life. Either by actual violence or by depriving them of the means of support (see the comment on Job 29:13). Job had been accused of robbery and oppression both by Zophar (Job 20:12-19) and Eliphaz (Job 22:5-9). He had not, however, been accused of actual murder.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob31:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.

Then let me be appropriately punished by finding the land, whereof I have wrongfully become possessed, produce nothing but thistles (or thorns) and noxious weeds, such as cockles (Authorized Version) or hemlock (Professor Lee). The words of Job are ended. This may be regarded either as Job's own conclusion of his long speech, or as a remark of the author's. On the whole, the former view is to be preferred.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - The discourse of Elihu is prefaced by a short introduction in plain prose, explaining who he was, and giving the reasons which actuated him in coming forward at this point of the dialogue. Verse 1. - So these three men ceased to answer Job. Zophar had been silenced earlier. Eliphaz and Bildad now felt that they had no more to say. They had exhausted the weapons of their armoury without any effect, and were conscious that nothing would be gained by mere reiteration. All their efforts had aimed at convincing Job of sin; and he was still unconvinced - he remained righteous in his own eyes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu. The name \"Elihu\" was not uncommon among the Israelites. It is found among the ancestors of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:1), among the Korhite Levites of the time of David (1 Chronicles 26:7), and as a variant for Eliab, one of David's brothers (1 Chronicles 27:8) The meaning of the word was, \"He is my God\" (אליהוא). The son of Barachal. Barachel is also a significant name. It means, \"Bless, O God,\" or \"God blesses\" (בר אל). Both names imply that the new interlocutor belonged to a family of monotheists. The Buzite. \"Huz\" and \"Buz\" were brothers, the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Maleah, the daughter of Haran (Genesis 11:29; Genesis 22:20, 21). Of the kindred of Ram. By \"Ram\" we are probably to understand \"Aram,\" who was the son of Kemuel, a brother of Huz and Buz. (On the connection of Huz and Buz with the Arabian tribes of Khazu and Bazu, see the comment on Job 1:1.) Against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. Elihu was well-intentional; and it is perhaps not surprising that he had been shocked by some of Job's expressions. Job had himself apologized for them (Job 6:26); and certainly they went perilously near taxing God with injustice (see Job 40:8). But it is to be remembered that finally God justifies Job's sayings, while condemning those of his \"comforters.\" \"My wrath is kindled,\" he says to Eliphaz, \"against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant Job hath\" (Job 42:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer. Elihu thought that Job's reasonings and complaints admitted of being satisfactorily answered, and was vexed that the three \"friends\" had not made the right replied It is the main object of his speech to supply them. And yet had condemned Job. They had condemned him on wrong grounds and of sins that he had not committed (Job 22:6-9). Elihu condemns him as much (Job 33:9-12; Job 34:7-9, etc.), but for entirely different reasons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken; rather, to speak to Job (see the Revised Version) He had waited impatiently until the three special \"friends\" had said their say, and be might come forward without manifest presumption. Because they were elder than he. (On the respect paid to age at this time in the land wherein Job lived, see the comment on Job 29:8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled (comp. ver. 3 and the comment).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-22. - The speech of Elihu now begins. In the present chapter, after a short apologetic exordium, excusing his youth (vers. 6-9), he addresses himself exclusively to Job's friends. He has listened attentively to them, and weighed their words (vers. 11, 12). but has found nothing in them that confuted Job. They had not \"found wisdom\" - they had not \"vanquished Job\" - at the last they had been \"amazed, and had not had a word more to say\" (vers. 13-16). Elihu, therefore, will supply their deficiency; he has kept silence with difficulty, and is full of thoughts, to which he would fain give utterance (vers. 17-20). In all that he says he will show no favouritism - he will \"accept no man's-person,\" \"give no flattering titles,\" but express sincerely what he believes (vers. 21, 22). Verse 6. - And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old. We can only guess at the exact ages of Job and his friends. From the fact that God at the last \"gave Job twice as much as he had before\" (Job 42:10), and the further fact that he lived, after he had recovered his prosperity, a hundred and forty years (Job 42:16), it has been conjectured that he was seventy years of age at the time of his conference with his friends, and that he died at the age of two hundred and ten. But this clearly is quite uncertain. He may not have been much more than fifty when his calamities fell upon him. If this were so, the age of his friends need not have exceeded from sixty to seventy. Perhaps Elihu was himself not more than thirty. Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion; rather, I held back and was afraid to utter what I knew in your presence. Elihu would have been thought unduly pushing and presumptuous if he had ventured to come forward until his seniors had ended their colloquy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I said; i.e. \"I kept saying to myself, when the desire to interrupt came upon me.\" Days should speak. Age should give wisdom, and the speech of the old should be most worthy of being attended to. Elihu had been brought up in this conviction, and therefore refrained himself. And multitude of years should teach wisdom. \"Old experience should attain to something of prophetic strain.\" \"One ought to give attention,\" says Aristotle, \"to the mere unproved assertions of wise and aged men, as much as to the actual demonstrations of others\" ('Eth. Nit.,' 6:11, ad fin. comp. also Job 10:12; Job 15:10; Proverbs 16:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But there is a spirit in man. But, after all, it is not mere age and experience that make men wise and able to teach others. \"There is a spirit in man\" (see Genesis 2:7); and it is according as this spirit is or is not enlightened from on high that men speak words of wisdom or the contrary. The inspiration of the Almighty - this it is, which - giveth them understanding. And such inspiration it is in the power of God to bestow, as he pleases, on the old or on the young, on the great of the earth, or on those of small reputation. Hence Elihu's conclusion -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreat men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged (always) understand judgment. Elihu lays down the universal law, before applying it to the particular instance. True wisdom is from God, not from observation and experience. Therefore many aged men are not wise; many experienced men, great in position, versed in affairs, do not possess understanding. It is a trite remark, \"With how little wisdom the world is governed!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Therefore I said, Hearken to me. Elihu evidently claims, not exactly what is ordinarily understood by inspiration, but that his spirit, is divinely enlightened, and that therefore he is more competent to take part in the controversy that has been raised than many of the aged. I also will show mine opinion. \"I also,\" or \"even I\" - i.e. I, young as I am, \"will show my opinion,\" or \"utter what I know on the subject.\" Elihu does not speak of his convictions as mere \"opinions,\" but claims to be in possession of actual \"knowledge.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Behold, I waited for your words; i.e. \"I was full of expectation; I waited impatiently to hear what you would say.\" Then, while you spoke, I gave ear to your reasons - or, your reasonings; I did my best to apprehend your meaning - whilst ye searched out what to say. Professor Lee translates, \"whilst ye examined Job's conclusions; but the Authorized Version is probably correct. Elihu means that he listened carefully while the friends hunted out all the arguments they could think of in order to confute Job.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Yea, I attended unto you - or, lent you my attention - and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job; rather, that convicted (or, confuted) Job. Or that answered his words. In Elihu's opinion, the argumentative value of all the long speeches of the three friends was nil; they had entirely failed to answer Job's arguments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom; or, beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom (see the Revised Version). \"Do not suppose, i.e., that you have triumphed in the controversy, that your mode of meeting Job's complaints is the wise and right one. The exact reverse is the case. You have not vanquished Job. On the contrary, he is unvanquished, and remains master of the field. If he is ever to be vanquished, it will not be by you. God thrusteth (rather, may thrust) him down, not man. A true prophecy! (see Job 40:1-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Now he hath not directed his words against me. Elihu thinks that he can interfere in the controversy with the better prospect of a good result, since he is untouched by any of Job's words, and can therefore speak without passion or resentment. Neither will I answer him with your speeches. He is also going to bring forward fresh arguments, which, as they avoid the line taken by the three friends, may soothe, instead of exasperating, the patriarch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15.- They were amazed, they answered no more. A change from the second to the third person, possibly as seeming less disrespectful. Or perhaps Elihu turns from the three friends at this point, as Professor Lee supposes, and addrNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - When I had waited (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more); rather, as in the Revised Version, and shall 1 wait because they speak not, because they stand still and answer no more? Am I to wait until they shall have recovered themselves, and found something to answer? Surely this is not necessary. Neither courtesy nor etiquette prescribes it. Especially when I have waited so long, and have so much to say, and am so exceedingly anxious to say it (see vers. 18-20). Elihu shows all the impatience and ardour of a young speaker (see ver. 6), and feels the confidence that young men so often feel in the wisdom and persuasiveness of their words (comp. Job 33:1-6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show mine opinion. The initial \"I said\" is superfluous. Elihu, having asked himself the question, \"Shall I wait?\" in ver. 16, here gives the answer. He will not wait any longer, he will take the word, he will set forth his conviction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For I am full of matter; literally, I am full of words; i.e. I have very much to say. The spirit within me constraineth me; literally, the spirit of my belly; i.e. \"my inward feelings and emotions.\" Compare Zophar's statements in Job 20:2, 3; and Job's own declarations in ch. 13, that he must speak (vers. 13, 19). There is a state of internal excitement, when reticence becomes impossible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent. The process of fermentation properly takes place in the vat, from which the gas evolved in the operation can freely escape. When wine was put into skins before fermentation was complete, and gas continued to be evolved, the effect was that the skins became distended, as the gas had no vent, and then not unfrequently the skins would burst, especially if they were old ones (see Matthew 9:17). It is ready to burst like new bottles. Even if the skins were new, they would undergo distension, and would appear as if \"ready to burst,\" though the actual catastrophe might be avoided. Elihu's pent-up feelings seem to him, if they do not obtain a vent, to threaten some such a result.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I will speak, that I may be refreshed; rather, that I may obtain relief; or, according to some, \"that I may be able to breathe\" (Cook, Rosenmuller). Elihu feels almost suffocated by conflicting feelings of rage (vers. 1-3), disappointment (vers. 11, 12), and anxiety to vindicate God's honour (ver. 2). I will open my lips and answer. In the remainder of Elihu's discourse the attempt is made to \"answer\" Job (see ch. 33-37), with what success will be considered elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person. Elihu hopes that, in what he is about to say, he will not permit himself to be swayed by any personal bias; that he will neither unduly favour the upper classes nor the vulgar (see Professor Lee, on the difference between אישׁ and אדם 'Book of Job,' p. 444), but will treat all fairly and equitably. Neither let me (he says) give flattering titles unto man. Professor Lee observes on this: \"The Oriental practice of giving long and fulsome titles is too well known to need anything beyond the mere mention of the fact.\" Elihu certainly, in the whole of his address, flatters no one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For I know not to give flattering titles; i.e. it is not my habit to give flattering titles, nor have I any knowledge of the art. I should expect that, if such were my habit, my Maker would soon take me away; would soon, i.e., remove me from the earth, as one whose influence was not for good, but for evil. Flattery is condemned by Job, in Job 17:5: by David, in the Psalms (Psalm 3:9; 12:2, 3; 78:36); and by Solomon, in the Book of Proverbs (Proverbs 2:16; Proverbs 7:21; Proverbs 20:19; Proverbs 28:23, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.33":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-33. - In this chapter Elihu, turning away from the \"comforters,\" proceeds to address Job himself, offering to reason out the matter in dispute with him, in God's stead. After a brief exordium (vers. 1-7), he takes exceptionNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to Job's self-assertion (vers. 8, 9); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to his charges against God (vers. 10-13),NEWLINENEWLINEwhich (he says) are unjust. He next brings forward his theory of God-inflicted sufferings being, in the main, chastisements proceeding from a loving purpose, intended to purify, to strengthen, to purge out faults, to \"save from the pit,\" to improve, and to enlighten (vers. 14-24). He points out in what spirit chastisement should be received (vers. 25-30); and concludes with a recommendation to Job to remain silent, and hear him out, while at the same time he expresses a willingness to listen to what Job has to say, if he has objections to offer (vers. 31-33). Verse 1. - Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches; rather, howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech (see the Revised Version); i.e. \"However you regard me personally, hear what I have to say.\" And hearken to all my words. Give me your full attention; do not suffer aught that I say to escape you. Elihu has a deep conviction of the importance of what he is about to utter (comp. Job 32:8, 10, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Behold, now I have opened my mouth. (On the solemnity of the phrase, \"opened my mouth,\" see the comment upon Job 3:1.) My tongue hath spoken in my mouth; literally, in my palate (comp. Job 6:30). Each word has been, as it were, tasted; that is, seriously considered and examined beforehand. My remarks will not be crude, extempore remarks; so may they be the better worth attending to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart. Moreover, whatever I say will be said with entire sincerity. My heart is upright, and I shall speak \"from the uprightness of my heart,\" without pretence, deception, or concealment of any kind. And my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. I shall say only what I know and shall endeavour to say it simply and clearly, so that no one can mistake my meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Spirit of God hath made me. This is assigned as the main reason why Job should give his best attention to Elihu's words. Elihu claims to be quickened and informed by the Divine Spirit which was once breathed into man (Genesis 2:7), whereby man became a living soul (comp. Job 32:8). And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life; or, quiekened me - originated and preserved my life. Elihu does not, however, claim that his words are actually inspired, or that he has a message to Job from the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If thou canst answer me; rather, if thou canst answer thou me (see the Revised Version). Set thy words in order before me, stand up (comp. Job 23:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead; i.e. I am the antagonist for whom thou hast asked (Job 9:33; Job 13:19), ready to enter into controversy with thee, instead of God. I am thine equal, a creature like thyself. I also am formed out of the clay (comp. Genesis 2:7). Therefore -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - My terror shall not make thee afraid. Thou canst feel no alarm at me; I cannot terrify thee, as God would (Job 6:4; Job 7:14; Job 9:34. etc.). Neither shall my hand (literally, my pack-saddle) be heavy upon thee. Thou wilt not feel my presence a burden, or be crushed under the weight of my words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-12. - His exordium over, Elihu proceeds to point out what he blames in Job's discourses, and at present notices two departures from truth and right only. Job, he says, asserts his absolute innocence (ver. 9); he also maintains that God deals with him harshly, as an enemy (vers. 10, 11). Neither assertion is justifiable. Verse 8. - Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying. Elihu does not quote exactly what Job had said. He probably intended to be perfectly fair and just, but in reality he greatly overstates the truth. Job had never said the words he ascribes to him in ver. 9; at best they are an inference, or deduction, from what he had said. And he had said a great deal on the other side, which Elihu overlooks (see the comment on ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I am clean without transgression, I am innocent. Job had not said that he was \"clean,\" or \"without transgression,\" or \"innocent.\" With respect to \"cleanness,\" he had observed, \"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,\" implying that all men were unclean (see Job 14:4). Concerning ,'transgressions,\" he had declared, \"I have sinned... Why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?\" (Job 7:20, 21); and again, \"Thou makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth\" (Job 13:26). Further, he had asked to be told the number of his iniquities and sins (Job 13:23), and declared that God kept his transgressions and iniquities sewn up and sealed in a bag (Job 14:17). With regard to \"innocence,\" the only observation that he had made was, \"I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent\" (Job 9:28). What he had really asserted was his uprightness, his integrity, his \"righteousness\" (Job 12:4: 16:17; 23. 7; 27:5, 6; 31:5-40). And these are exactly what God bore witness to (Job 1:8; Job 2:3). It is plain, then, that Elihu overstated his ease, and, whatever his intentions were, was practically almost as unfair to Job as the \"comforters.\" Neither is there iniquity in me. Nor had Job said this. He had frequently acknowledged the contrary (see Job 7:21; Job 13:26; Job 14:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Behold, he findeth occasions against me. This charge may perhaps be justified by reference to Job's complaints in Job 7:17-19 and Job 10:3-6; but the exact words are not Job's. He counteth me for his enemy. Certainly, Job had said this more than ones (see Job 16:9; Job 19. l 1). But he cannot really have believed it, or his trust in God must have failed. The fact that to the last he clung to God, appealed to him, hoped to receive judgment from him (Job 31:2, 6, 28, 35-37), is proof sufficient that he knew God was not really alienated from him, but would in the end acknowledge him and vindicate his character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He putteth my feet in the stocks. A reference to Job's words in Job 13:27. He marketh all my paths (comp. Job 31:4, and Job 7:17-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Behold, in this thou art not just. It would certainly not have been a just charge to make against God, that he counted Job as an enemy; and, so far as Job's statements go, it must be admitted that he had laid himself open to Elihu's rebuke. But it is no logical \"answer\" to Job's charge to say, in reply to it, I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. Might does not constitute right, and it is a poor way of justifying God to urge that he is all-powerful, and may do what he likes. So Cambyses was justified in his worst acts by the royal judges (Herod., 3:31); and so in an absolute monarchy it is always possible to justify the extremest acts of tyranny. Certainly God cannot act unjustly; but this is not because his doing a thing makes it right, but because his justice, is a law to his will, and he never wills to do anything that he has not previously seen to be just (see Cudworth's 'Immutable Morality,' which deserves the careful study, not alone of moralists, but also of theologians).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Why dost thou strive against him? Why dost thou insist on taking the attitude of one who contends with God, who would fain enter into a controversy with him, and force him to plead in his own defence? It is not alone his omnipotence that makes such conduct folly, but his remoteness, his inaccessibility. He cannot be forced to make answer; it is not his wont to do so; he giveth not account of any of his matters. It is presumptuous to suppose that God will condescend to reveal himself from heaven and make answer to thy overbold challenges.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For God speaketh once, yea twice. God has his own ways of speaking to man, which are not those that Job has been expecting. He speaks silently and secretly, not in thunders and lightnings, as at Sinai (Exodus 19:16-20), not by extraordinary theophanies, but nevertheless quite as effectually. Yet man perceiveth it not. Man often does net recognize God's action in this silent teaching of his. Man wants something more startling, more sensational. In our Lord's time, the Jews demanded \"a sign\" - \"a sign from heaven;\" but no sign of the kind was given them. Job now did not understand that God, whom he called upon to answer him (Job 10:2; Job 13:22; Job 23:5, etc.), was already speaking to him in various ways - by his judgments, by thoughts suggested inwardly to his heart, by the dreams and visions whereof he complained (Job 7:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - In a dream, in a vision of the sight. So God spoke to Abimelech (Genesis 20:3-7), to Jacob (Genesis 31:11), to Laban (Genesis 31:24), to Joseph (Genesis 38:5, 9), to the Pharaoh whom Joseph served (Genesis 41:1-7), to Solomon (1 Kings 3:5), to Daniel (Daniel 2:19), to Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2:28; Daniel 4:5-18), and to many others. Sometimes men recognized such visions as Divine communications; but sometimes, probably quite as often, they regarded them as mere dreams, fancies, phantasies, unworthy of any attention. Elihu seems to hold that Divine visions came only when deep sleep falleth upon men; and similarly Eliphaz, in Job 4:13. This method of revelation seems to belong especially to the more primitive times, and the earlier stages of God's dealings with men. In the New Testament dreams scarcely form any part of the economy of grace. In slumberings upon the bed. A pleonastic addition, which must not be regarded as diminishing from the force of the precedent clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction. At such times, Elihu holds, God gives men spiritual wisdom, instructs them, makes them understand his dealings with them and his purposes with respect to them. If Job is perplexed concerning the Almighty's ways with himself, and desires explanations, let him have his ear open to the Divine teaching on such occasions, and seriously lay it to heart. He will thus, it may be, find his perplexity diminished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - That he (i.e. God) may withdraw man from his purpose; literally, from his work, assumed to be a wrongful work. Elihu regards the Divine teaching through visions as intended to elevate and purify men. Sometimes God so works upon them as to make them abandon an evil course on which they had entered. Sometimes his object is to save them from indulgence in an evil temper into which, without his help, they might have fallen. In this latter case he may occasionally hide pride from man. Elihu, perhaps, thinks that Job is unduly proud of his integrity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. By these interpositions God may even save a man from utter ruin, when, but for them, he would have rushed upon it. He may cause a person -to give up designs or enterprises which would have brought him into danger, and perhaps led to his being slain with the sword.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He is chastened also with pain upon his bed. God also speaks to men, secretly and silently, in another way, viz. through chastisements. He afflicts the strong man with a grievous sickness, causes him to take to his bed, racks him with pain there, and wrings the multitude of his bones with strong pain. But here again his purpose is kind and loving.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20 - Be that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. Eating and drinking are detestable to the man who is stretched on a bed of sickness (comp. Psalm 107:18, \"Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death\"). The chains that bind to earth fall off, and the soul is left open to loftier influences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; literally, from the sight; but the Authorized Version gives probably the correct meaning. And his bones that were not seen stick out. These are general features of a wasting illness (comp. Psalm 22:17, \"I may tell all my bones\"). Such illness gives the sufferer time to review thoroughly his life and cow duct, and see to it \"if there be any way of wickedness in him,\" or any particular form of sin to which he is tempted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. \"The destroyers\" are probably the angels to whom the task is assigned of ultimately inflicting death, if minor chastisements prove insufficient (comp. 2 Samuel 24:16, 17; Psalm 78:49, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - If there be a messenger with him; rather, an angel (see the Revised Version). It is generally supposed that \"the angel of the covenant\" is meant, and that the whole passage is Messianic; but much obscurity hangs over it. The Jews certainly understand it Messianically, since they read it on the great Day of Atonement, and use in their liturgies the prayer, \"Raise up for us the righteous Interpreter; say, I have found a ransom.\" Elihu's knowledge of an Interpreter, or Mediator, one among a thousand, who should deliver the afflicted man from going down to the pit, and find a ransom for him (ver. 24), is certainly very surprising; and we can scarcely imagine that he understood the full force of his words; but it cannot be right to denude them of their natural signification Elihu certainly did not mean to speak of himself as an \"angel-interpreter, one among a thousand;\" and it is not probable that he intends a reference to any merely human helper. To show unto man. his uprightness; either \"to show to a man what it is right for him to do,\" or \"to indicate to a man in what true righteousness consists.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Then he is gracious unto him; and saith. Some interpret, \"Then he (i.e. God) is gracious unto him, and he (i.e. the angel) saith. Others make God the subject of both clauses. But the angel is the natural subject. Deliver him from going down to the pit. The mediating angel thus addresses God, and adds, I have found a ransom, leaving the nature of the ransom unexplained. Some notion of ransom, or atonemeat, underlay the whole idea of sacrifice, which appears to have been universally practised from the remotest times, by the Oriental nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. The chastisement having done its work, and the sufferer being delivered from death by the mediating angel, a restoration to health follows. The recovery of \"flesh fresher than a child's\" stands as the natural antithesis to Job's leprosy. He shall return to the days of his youth. Youthful strength, youthful vigour, youthful feelings, shall come back to him. He shall be once more as he was in the days of his prime.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He shall pray unto God, and he (i.e. God) will be favourable unto him, Being restored to God's favour, he will once more be able to address him in \"effectual fervent prayer,\" and obtain whatever he desires of him. And he shall see his face with joy. God's face shall no longer be a terror to him, but he shall look upon it with joy and gladness. For he (i.e. God, will render unto man his righteousness. That is, will both account and make him righteous - both justify and sanctify him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He looketh upon men; rather, he (i.e. the restored penitent) singeth before men. He is jubilant, and confesses his former offences with a light heart, feeling that now he is pardoned and restored to God's favour. And if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right. This is altogether a mistranslation. The construction of the Hebrew is simple enough, and runs thus: And he (the penitent) saith, I have sinned and perverted that which was right. And it profited me not; i.e. \"I gained nothing by my transgressions - they brought me us advantage.\" Compare St. Paul's inquiry (Romans 6:21), \"What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?\" Some, however, translate, \"And it was not requited to me,\" which also gives a good meaning°NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light; rather, as in the margin, he hath delivered my soul from going into the pit (comp. ver. 24), and my life shall see the light. The restored penitent is still speaking.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes (literally, twice and thrice) with man. Elihu, from this point to the end of the chapter, speaks in his own person. God, he says, thus works with man, through visions or through chastisements oftentimes - not in the latter case, taking vengeance on them for their sins, but graciously leading them on to a better mind and a higher spiritual condition. This is part of God's ordinary moral government, and Job has no need to suppose himself exceptionally dealt with. Elihu has reason on his side in all this, and his words may have given Job some comfort. But they did not exactly fit Job's ease. Elihu, unless supernaturally enlightened, could not possibly penetrate into the special circumstances of Job's trial. He could only try to bring his case under general laws, of which it was not an illustration; and so, though well-meant and probably of some service, his argument was no complete answer to Job's difficulties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - To bring back his soul from the pit. For discipline and correction, not for vengeance - in love and not in anger (comp. Hebrews 12:5-11, where the doctrine is set forth fully). To be enlightened with the light of the living; or, that he may be enlightened. This is God's purpose, ordinarily, in afflicting men; or, at any rate, a part of his purpose He aims at enlightening their understandings, and so enabling them to comprehend his ways, and clearly see the path which it is their true wisdom to walk in.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me; i.e. \"Mark well what I say. Note it, and lay it up in thy heart.\" Hold thy peace, and I will speak. It may be conjectured that Job at this point showed some inclination to break silence and answer Elihu. But Elihu thought that he had a great deal more to say, which was of importance, and wished not to be interrupted. He therefore checked Job's utterance. Then, fearing lest he had gone too far, he made the concession of the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - If thou hast anything to say, answer me. Nevertheless, i.e., if there is really anything that thou wouldst fain urge on thine own behalf at this point, speak - I am ready to hear - for I dare to justify thee; i.e. \"I am anxious, if possible, or so far as possible, to defend and justify thy conduct.\" Then, probably, Elihu made a pause, to allow of Job's speaking; but, as the patriarch kept silence, he continued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob33:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. Elihu is certainly quite sufficiently impressed with the sense of his intellectual capacity. Job's silence may have been meant as a sort of tacit rebuke to him. Considering his youth (Job 32:6), there is something of arrogance in the whole tone of his address, and especially in his notion that he could \"teach Job wisdom.\" It is significant that neither now, when expressly invited to reply, nor at any subsequent point of the discourse, nor even at its close, does Job condescend to make any answer at all to Elihu's speech.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFurthermore Elihu answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-37. - In this chapter Elihu turns from Job to those whom he addresses as \"wise men\" (ver. 2), or \"men of understanding\" (ver. 10). Whether these are Job's three special friends, or others among the company which had perhaps gathered to hear the debate, is uncertain. He makes the subject of his address to them Job's conduct - scarcely a polite thing to do in Job's presence. Job, he says, has scorned God and charged him with injustice (vers. 5-9). He will vindicate him. This he proceeds to do in vers. 10-30. He then points out what Job's course ought to be (vers. 31-33), and winds up by an appeal to the \"men of understanding\" to endorse his condemnation of Job as a sinner and a rebel (vers. 34-37). Verses 1, 2. - Furthermore Elihu answered and said, Hear my words, O ye wise men. Having, as he may have thought, reduced Job to silence by the fame of his reasonings, Elihu, wishing to carry with him the general consent of his audience, makes an appeal to them, or, at any rate, to the wise among them, to judge Job's conduct and pronounce upon it. It is probable, as Schultens remarks, that a considerable number of influential persons had by this time collected together to hear the discussion which was going on. To these Elihu specially addresses himself: Give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. A proverbial expression, already used by Job in the dialogue (Job 12:11). \"It is as much the business of the ear to discriminate between wise and foolish words, as of the palate to distinguish between wholesome and unwholesome food.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Let us choose to us judgment; i.e. \"Let us seek to come to a right conclusion (mishphat) on each subject that comes before us for consideration.\" Let us know among ourselves that which is good. \"Let us know, discern, and recognize that which is right and good.\" Excellent sentiments, but somewhat pompously put forth by a young man addressing elder ones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For Job hath said, I am righteous. Job had maintained his \"righteousness\" in a certain sense, i.e. his integrity, his honesty, his conviction that God would ultimately acquit him; but he had not maintained his sinlessness (see the comment on Job 33:9). He had not even said, in so many words, \"I am righteous.\" The nearest that he had come to saying it was when (in Job 13:18) he had exclaimed, \"I know that I shall be held righteous,\" or \"justified.\" And God hath taken away my judgment. Job had said this (Job 27:2), but in the sense that God had withheld from him the judgment on his cause which he desired, not that he had perverted judgment, and wrongfully condemned him (see the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 97).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Should I lie against my right? This was an essential portion of Job's argument (see Job 27:4). Against the theory of his secret heinous wickedness put forward by his \"comforters,\" he maintained consistently his freedom from conscious deliberate opposition to the will of God, and refused to make the confessions which they suggested or required, on the ground that they would have been untrue - in making them he would have \"lied against his right.\" In this certainly Job \"sinned not.\" But it was essential to the theory of Elihu, no less than to that of Eliphaz and his friends, that Job was suffering on account of past iniquity, whether he were being punished for it in anger or chastised for it in love (see Job 33:17, 27). My wound (literally, my arrow; comp. Job 6:4) is incurable without transgression; i.e. without my having committed any transgression to account for it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? This comment is not only unnecessary, but unfair. It was not for Elihu, who professed a desire to \"justify\" (or completely exonerate) Job, to aggravate his guilt by means of rhetorical comment; and the comment itself was unfair, for Job had not indulged in scorn to any extent, much less \"drunk it up like water\" (comp. Job 15:16). He had in no respect scorned God; and if he had occasionally poured some scorn upon his \"comforters\" (Job 6:21; Job 12:2; Job 13:4-13; Job 16:2; Job 21:2-5; Job 26:2-4), must it not be admitted that they had deserved it? It was the duty of Elihu to act as moderator between Job and the \"comforters,\" whereas he here seeks to exasperate them, and lash them up to fury against their afflicted friend. Perhaps Job's impassive attitude has embittered him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity. It is impossible to supply any other antecedent to \"which\" than Job himself. Elihu therefore accuses Job of having turned aside from righteousness, and betaken himself to the \"counsel of the ungodly, the way of sinners, and the seat of the scornful\" (Psalm 1:1). This is grossly to exaggerate Job's faults of temper, and puts Elihu very nearly on a level with Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar in respect of misconception and rudeness. And walketh with wicked men. If no more is meant than that Job has adopted principles and arguments commonly used by wicked men (Canon Cook), the language employed is unfortunate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. Again it must be remarked that Job had not said this. The nearest approach to it is to be found in Job 9:22, where this passage occurs: \"It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked\" (Revised Version). Elsewhere Job speaks, not generally, but of his own individual case, remarking that his righteousness has not saved him from calamity (Job 9:17, 18; Job 10:15; Job 17:9-17, etc.). And the fact is one that causes him the deepest perplexity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding (comp. ver. 2). Elihu repeats himself, wishing to call special attention to his justification of God (vers. 10-30). Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness. Elihu probably means that to do wickedness is contrary to the very nature and idea of God; but he does not express himself very clearly. And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. An evil God, a God who can do wrong, is a contradiction in terms - an impossible, inconceivable idea. Devil-worshippers, if there are or ever have been such persons, do not conceive of the object of their worship as really God, but as a powerful malignant spirit. Once rise to the height of the conception of a Power absolutely supreme, omniscient, omnipresent, the Author of all things, and it is impossible to imagine him as less than perfectly good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For the work of a man shall he render unto him. God \"rewardeth every man according to his work\" (Psalm 62:13), renders to each one good or evil, according as his own deeds have been the one or the other. But this must be understood of the man's whole conduct, and God's entire treatment of him. Such an absolute rectitude of God's moral government, considered as a whole, is implied and involved in his absolute and perfect justice. And cause every man to find according to his ways. We \"find according to our ways\" when, having \"ploughed iniquity, and sown wickedness, we reap the same\" (Job 4:8), or when, on the other hand, having \"sown in righteousness, we reap in mercy\" (Hosea 10:12). Exact retribution is the law of God's rule; but the exactness cannot be seen, or tested, or demonstrated in this life. It will appear, however, and be recognized by all, at the consummation of all things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. Elihu is fond of rhetorical amplification, like most young speakers. Vers. 11, 12 contain nothing that is really additional to the statement in ver. 10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Who hath given him a charge over the earth? The argument seems to be that if God had \"received a charge,\" and were in possession of a mere delegated authority, like the subordinate gods of heathen nations, he might have an interest apart from that of those whom he governs, and so be tempted to be unjust; but as he is the Author of all and the sole Ruler of all, his interest must be bound up with the true interests of his creatures, and cannot clash with them. He can thus never be unjust, since he can have no temptation to be unjust. Or who hath disposed the whole world? rather, Who hath laid upon him the whole world? (see the margin of the Revised Version). Elihu repeats the idea of the previous clause in other words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath. Two renderings are proposed, both supported By about equal authority:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"If he (i.e. God) set his heart upon himself, if he should gather to himself his own spirit, and breath,\" then all flesh would perish, etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"If he [i.e. God] set his heart upon [or, 'against'] man, if he were to gather to himself man's spirit and man's breath,\" then, etc. The difference is not great. God could, either by withdrawing from man the breath and spirit which he has given him, or simply by withholding from man the quickening and sustaining influences which he is perpetually putting forth, reduce all humankind to nothingness. Being so completely master of man, he would surely not condescend to treat him with injustice. Injustice implies something of opposition, struggle, rivalry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - All flesh shall perish together (comp. Psalm 104:29). Without God's sustaining hand, all creatures would fall back into nothingness. And man shall turn again unto dust, Either Elihu refers here to Genesis 3:19, or else he has a traditional knowledge of man's origin, handed down from a remote antiquity, which is in entire conformity with the Hebrew belief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - If now thou hast understanding, hear this. The appeal is not to Job, but to any wise and intelligent man among the many hearers who were present (see the comment on vers. 1, 2). Hearken to the voice of my words (comp. vers. 2, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Shall even he that hateth right govern? Is it conceivable that there can be at the head of the universe, its Ruler and Guide, One who hates justice? The appeal is to the instinctive feeling that in the one God perfect goodness and omnipotence are united. Its spirit is exactly that of Abraham's question, \"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" (see Genesis 18:5). And wilt thou condemn him that is most just? rather, him that is both just and strong (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? Would any subject of an earthly king deem it fitting to accuse his sovereign of wicked and unjust conduct? Would he even tax those who stood next to the king - the princes and great officers of the court - with ungodliness? If a sense of what is becoming and seemly would restrain a man from the use of language of this sort towards his earthly ruler, can it be right that he should allow himself in such liberty or speech towards his heavenly King, his absolute Lord and Master? Job had not really used such language of God, though the complaints which he had made with respect to God's treatment of him might not unreasonably be held to imply some such accusation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes! How much less becomingly is such language used of One so far above princes that he regards them as on a level with all other men, and pays them no special respect! Worldly rank is, of course, nothing with God. All mankind are his subjects and servants, whom he differentiates one from another solely by their moral and spiritual qualities. Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor. If earthly rank is of no account with God, much less is abundance of possessions. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus places his complete indifference in a strong light. For they all are the work of his hands. All classes of men, rich and poor, powerful and weak, are equally God's creatures, brought into the world by him, given by him their several stations, and regarded by him with favour or disfavour, according as they conduct themselves in their various occupations and employments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In a moment shall they die. All lie under the same law of death -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Pallida Mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernasNEWLINERegumque turres.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Horace,'Od.,' 1:4, 11. 13, 14.) In a moment, whenever God wills, they pass from life and disappear, the rich equally with the needy, the powerful prince as much as the outcast and the beggar. And the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away. (comp. Exodus 12:29; 2 Kings 19:35). Such sudden catastrophes are infrequent; but it is within the power of God to produce them at any time. When they occur, they strikingly exemplify the equality of his dealings with all classes of men, since none escape (Exodus 11:5; Exodus 12:29). And the mighty shall be taken away without hand; i.e. without human agency (comp. Daniel 2:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. Elihu proceeds to a fresh argument. The omniscience of God is a security against his acting unjustly. He knows exactly each man's powers, capacities, temperament, temptations, circumstances He can exactly me, sure each man's due, and will assuredly mete it out to each without partiality or prejudice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. \"All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do\" (Hebrews 4:13). However careful wicked men may be to conceal their misdeeds by \"waiting for the twilight\" (Job 24:15), or doing them \"in the dark\" (Job 24:16), they will find it quite impossible to escape the all-seeing eye of the Almighty, which is as clear-sighted in the deepest darkness as in the brightest light (\"Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day; the darkness and light to thee are both alike,\" Psalm 139:11, Prayer-book Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For he will not lay upon man more than right; rather,for he needeth not further to consider a man (see the Revised Version). He has no need to consider any man's case twice; he sees it at the first glance, and judges it infallibly. That he should enter into judgment with God, Were it not so, a man might perhaps claim to have a second trial, and, pleading in his own defence, might \"enter into judgment with God,\" or (according to others) \"go before God in judgment;\" but God's absolute omniscience precludes this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He shall break in pieces mighty men without number; rather, in ways that are unsearchable, or in ways past finding out (see the Revised Version). And set others in their stead (comp. 1 Samuel 2:7; Psalm 75:7; Daniel 2:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Therefore (i.e. to that end or with that object in view) he knoweth (rather, taketh knowledge of) their works. As God governs the world, and governs it, to a large extent, by exalting some men and depressing others, he is bound to take strict account of their conduct, that he may exalt the worthy and depress the unworthy. And he overturneth them in the night (comp. ver. 20). So that they are destroyed; literally, crushed. God's judgments fall on men suddenly, either \"in the night,\" or as \"In the night, i.e. suddenly, unexpectedly, when they are quite unprepared; and fall on them with \"crushing\" force, with a might that is wholly irresistible,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He striketh them as wicked men; i.e. as open and acknowledged malefactors. In the open sight of others; literally, in the place of beholders; i.e. publicly, openly, where their fate is an example to others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Because they turned back from him (On the sin of \"turning back,\" see 2 Kings 17:15, 16; Proverbs 26:11; 2 Peter 2:22.) And would not consider any of his ways (comp. Psalm 28:5; Isaiah 5:12). The folly and wickedness of such conduct is reproved by Solomon in the strongest terms, \"Because I have called, and ye refused: I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Thou shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their Own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them\" (Proverbs 1:24-32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him. Elihu views the wicked man as almost certainly an oppressor, whose misdeeds \"cause the cry of the poor to come before God,\" and provoke God, the Avenger of the poor and needy, to visit him with chastisement. And he heareth the cry of the afflicted (comp. Exodus 2:23, 24; Exodus 22:23, 24; Psalm 12:5, etc.) God's ears are ever open to the cry of the oppressed, and his hand is ever heavy upon those who \"afflict\" the weak and defenceless (Isaiah 1:24; Isaiah 3:12-15; Amos 5:11, 12; Micah 3:1-4; Habakkuk 1:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? literally, Who then can condemn? The sentiment is the same as that of St. Paul in the Epistle to the Romans, \"If God be for us, who can be against us?... Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?\" (Romans 8:31-34). And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? When God hideth away his face, then all flesh is troubled (Psalm 104:29); man shrinks into himself, and despairs of happiness; nature itself seems to fail and fade. None nan behold him when he hides himself; none can do more than deprecate his anger, and pray, \"Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us\" (Psalm 4:6). Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only. The results are similar, whether God withdraws the light of his countenance from a nation or from an individual. In either case, there is no help from without; ruin and destruction follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared; rather, that an ungodly man reign not, that a people be not a snare. (So Schultens, Professor Lee, and others.) The passage is obscure from its brevity; but this seems to be the best sense. God withdraws his favour from an ungodly king or from a wicked nation, that the king may cease to injure men by his rule, and the nation cease to be a snare to its neighbours.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement. (So Rosenmuller and others.) If the passage be thus rendered, Elihu must be considered as, like Eliphaz (Job 5:8), Bildad (Job 8:5), and Zophar (Job 11:13-15), counselling Job to submit himself to God, acknowledging his sin, accepting his punishment, and promising amendment for the future (ver. 22). But perhaps it is better to regard the passage as interrogative, and Elihu as asking - What man, among those whom God has cast down and punished, has ever sought to deprecate his wrath by contrition, confession, and promise of amendment, implying that, had they done so, God would have relented and forgiven them? (see the Revised Version). In this case no direct counsel is offered to Job; but still an indirect hint is given him. I will not offend any more. This is preferable to the marginal rendering of the Revised Version, \"though I have not offended.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - That which I see not, teach thou me; i.e. \"If in anything I fail to see thy will, teach thou it me. Make thy way plain before my face.\" If I have done iniquity, I will do no more. The hypothetical form seems to be preferred, as more acceptable to Job, who maintained his righteousness, than a positive confession of sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it. The two clauses should be taken together, and the translation should run, \"Should God recompense\" (i.e. make his awards) \"according to thy pleasure'\" or \"as thou wiliest?\" Elihu turns to Job and directly addresses him, \"Can he expect that God will make his decrees - condemn and absolve men - just as Job thinks right?\" Whether thou refuse; rather, since thou refusest them. Job had refused to acknowledge the justice of God's awards and decisions. Or whether thou choose; and not I; rather, but thou must choose, and not I. It is Job who must determine how he will act. Elihu, a friend, can only point out and recommend a course, as he had done in vers. 31, 32. It is for Job himself to determine what course he will take. Therefore speak what thou knowest; i.e. \"Say what thou hast determined on.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. As Job does not answer him, Elihu turns to his \"men of understanding\" (supra, vers. 2, 10). He feels sure that he will at least have carried them with him, and that they will join in the condemnation of Job's words as wanting in true wisdom. \"Men of understanding,\" he says, \"will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me will say, Job speaketh without knowledge,\" etc. (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJob hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom; literally, not in wisdom. The words intended are, of course, those in which Job has seemed to tax God with injustice (see the comment on ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end; literally, Would that Job were tested to the uttermost! - \"tested'\" i.e., as gold is tested, by the touchstone, and \"to the uttermost,\" so that there should be no doubt as to the result. Elihu had his wish. Job was tried as severely as possible, and the issue was pronounced by God himself. \"Ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath\" (ch. 42:8, Revised Version). Because of his answers for wicked men; rather, after the manner of wicked men (comp. above, vers. 5, 6, 9.). This was the view which Elihu took of Job's rash words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob34:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - For he addeth rebellion unto his sin. Elihu holds that it is Job's \"sin\" which has brought on him his chastisement, and regards his expostulations and complaints as flagrant \"rebellion\" against the Most High. He clappeth his hands among us; i.e. he applauds himself, approves of his own conduct, and, instead of repenting, makes a boast of it. And multiplieth his words against God. Job had continued to the last (Job 31.) to justify himself and protest his integrity; which, in the view of Elihu, was to tax God with injustice.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.35":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElihu spake moreover, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-16. - In this short chapter, once more Elihu addresses himself to Job, first (vers. 1-8) answering his complaint that a life of righteousness has brought him no correspondent blessings; and then (vers. 9-14) explaining to him that his prayers and appeals to God have probably not been answered because they were not preferred in a right spirit, i.e. with faith and humility. Finally (verb. 15, 16), he condemns Job for haughtiness and arrogance, and reiterates the charge that he \"multiplies words without knowledge\" (comp. Job 34:35-37). Verses 1, 2. - Elihu spake moreover, and said, Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? Once more it is to be observed that Job had said no such thing. At the worst, he had made statements from which it might be argued that he regarded himself as having a more delicate sense of justice than God (e.g. Job 9:22-24; Job 10:3; Job 12:6, etc.). But Elihu insists on pushing Job's intemperate phrases to their extremest logical issues, and taxing Job with having said all that his words might seem to a strict logician to involve (compare the comment on Job 34:5, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For thou saidst What advantage will it be unto thee? i.e. What advantage will thy righteousness be unto thee? Job had certainly argued that his righteousness brought him no temporal advantage; but he had always a conviction that he would ultimately be the better for it. Elihu, however, does not acknowledge this; and, assuming that Job expects to receive no advantage at all from his integrity, argues that God is not bound to afford him any. And, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? rather, And what profit shall f have, more than if I had sinned? (see the Revised Version, and compare the comments of Rosenmuller and Canon Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee; i.e. \"thy comforters, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.\" Elihu has pledged himself to confute their reasonings, no less than those of Job (Job 32:5-20), and now proposes to carry out this intention. But it is not very clear that he accomplish, s his purpose. In point of fact, he does little more than repeat and expand the argument of Eliphaz (Job 22:2, 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou; i.e. \"look to the material sky and heavens, so far above thee and so unapproachable, and judge from them how far the God who made them is above thy puny, feeble self - how incapable he is of being touched by any of thy doings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? Man's sins against God cannot injure him, diminish from his power, or lower his dignity. They can only injure the sinner himself. God does not punish them because they harm him, but because they are discords in the harmony of his moral universe. Or even if thy transgressions be multiplied; i.e. if thou persistest in a long course of sin, and addest \"rebellion\" to transgression, and self-complacency to rebellion, and \"multipliest thy words against God\" (Job 34:37) - even then, what doest thou unto him?.. what hurt dost thou inflict upon him?

By parity of reasoning, as our sins do not injure God, so our righteousness cannot benefit him. As David says, \"My goodness extendeth not to thee\" (Psalm 16:2). Or what receiveth he of thine hand? All things being already God's, we can but give him of his own. We cannot really add to his possessions, or to his glory, or to his felicity. We cannot, as some have supposed they could ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 143, 144), lay him under an obligation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son (rather, a son) of man. Job must not think, Elihu means, that, because his good actions benefit and his bad actions injure his fellow men, therefore they must also in the one case injure and in the other benefit God. The cases are not parallel. God is too remote, too powerful, too great, to be touched by his actions. Job has done wrong, therefore, to expect that God would necessarily reward his righteousness by prosper us, happy life, and worse to complain because his expectations have been disappointed. It is of his mere spontaneous goodness and bounty that God rewards the godly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-14. - Job had made it a frequent subject of complaint that God did not hear, or at any rate did not answer, his prayers and cries for relief. Elihu answers that Job's case is not exceptional. Those who cry out against oppression and suffering frequently receive no answer, but it is because they \"ask amiss.\" Job should have patience and trust. Verse 9. - By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry; rather, by reason of the multitude of oppressions, men cry out. It is not Job only who cries to God. Oppressors are numerous; the oppressed are numerous; everywhere there are complaints and outcries. They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. The oppressors are, for the most part, the mighty of the earth - kings, princes, nobles (see Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 3:14, 15; Hosea 5:10; Amos 4:1, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But none saith, Where is God my Maker? The oppressed, in many cases, do not appeal to God at all. They mutter and complain and groan because of their afflictions; but they have not enough faith in God to cry to him. Or, if they do so cry, it is not in a right spirit; it is despondingly, despairingly, not confidently or cheerfully. God is one who giveth songs in the night. The truly pious man sings hymns of praise in his affliction, as Paul and Silas did in the jail at Philippi, looking to God with faith and a lively hope for deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven. Elihu probably alludes to Job's defence of his complaints as natural, like the instinctive cries of beasts and birds (Job 6:5). God, he says, has given to man a higher nature than he has bestowal on the brutes; and this nature should teach him to carry his griefs to God in a proper spirit- a spirit of faith, piety, humility, and resignation. If men cried to him in this spirit, they would obtain an answer. If they do not obtain an answer, it must be that the proper spirit is lacking (comp. James 4:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - There they cry. \"There,\" smitten by calamity, they do at last cry to God. But none giveth answer. They \"ask, and receive not.\" Why? Because of the pride of evil men. Because, i.e., they ask proudly, not humbly; they claim relief as a right, not as a favour; they approach God in a spirit that offends him and prevents him from granting their requests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Surely God will not hear vanity. God will not hear prayers that are rendered \"vain\" by sin or defect in those who offer them, as by a want of faith, piety, humility, or resignation. Neither will the Almighty regard any such petitions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlthough thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him; rather, How much less when thou sayest thou canst not see him! (compare the Revised Version); i.e. how much less will God attend to thy prayers when thou sayest that thou canst not see or find him (Job 9:11; Job 23:3, 8-10), that he is altogether hid from thee, and treats thee as an enemy (Job 33:10)! Still, judgment (or, the cause, i.e. \"thy cause') is before him, or \"awaits his decision.\" Therefore trust thou in him. Wait on, in patience and trust. The last word is not yet spoken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - Leaving his advice to sink into Job's mind, Elihu turns from him to the bystanders, and remarks, with some severity, that it is because Job has not been punished enough, because God has not visited him for his petulance and arrogance, that he indulges in \"high swelling words of vanity,\" and continues to utter words which are foolish and\" without knowledge.\" Verse 15. - But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger. This is an impossible rendering. The Hebrew is perfectly plain, and is to be translated literally as follows: But now, because he hath not visited his (i.e. Job's) anger. (So Schultens, Canon Cook, and, with a slight difference, our Revisers.) God had not visited Job with any fresh afflictions on account of his vehement expostulations and overbold and reckless words. Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity. The Authorized Version again wholly misses the meaning. Translate, with the Revised Version, Neither doth he greatly regard (Job's) arrogance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob35:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; or, in vanity (comp. ver. 13). He multiplieth words without knowledge; i.e. he is bold to speak words that are vain and insensate, because God has not, as he might have done, punished him for his previous utterances.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.36":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElihu also proceeded, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-33. - The two chapters, ch. 36. and 37, form a single discourse, and ought not to have been separated; or, at any rate, not so unskilfully as they are, in the middle of a description of a thunderstorm. They constitute a final appeal to Job, who is exhorted to submission, resignation, and patience, in consideration of God's inscrutability, and of his perfect justice, wisdom, and strength. Ch. 36 begins with a short preface (vers. 1-4), in which Elihu seeks to prove his right to offer counsel to Job, after which God's justice is demonstrated (vers. 5-16), and Job warned that his petulance may lead to his complete destruction (vers. 17-25). Finally, in illustration of God's might and unsearchableness' the description of a thunderstorm is commenced (vers. 26-33), which is carried on into the next chapter. Verses 1, 2. - Elihu also proceeded, and said, Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf; literally, that there are yet words for God. The controversy, i.e., is not exhausted; there is yet much that may be urged on God's behalf, in respect of the charges thou hast made against him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSuffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will fetch my knowledge from afar (compare the declaration of Bildad, Job 8:8). In neither case does the performance justify the pretentious character of the preface. Elihu's arguments are, for the most part, trite and commonplace. And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. I will show, i.e., that God is righteous and just (comp. Job 34:10, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. The words sound arrogant; but perhaps Elihu does not mean any more than W pledge himself to speak truthfully, and to say only what he has perfect knowledge cf. It is clear that he speaks of himself, net of God (Stanley Loathes). in the second clause of the verse, as in the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Behold, God is mighty. The preface over, the argument to prove God's justice begins. First, he \"is mighty.\" How unlikely that any one who is mighty - nay, almighty - should be unjust! Next, he despiseth not any. Job has wrongly charged him with \"despising the work of his own hands.\" In truth, he despises nothing that he has made. \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered\" (Matthew 10:29, 30). Much less, then, is any man despised. Moreover, God is mighty in strength and wisdom; or rather, in strength of undertaking and therefore above the weakness of being unjust.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He preserveth not the life of the wicked. There is no special providence over the life of the wicked, as Job had supposed, or pretended to suppose (Job 21:7; comp. Job 12:6). On the contrary, God \"overturneth\" wicked men \"in the night, so that they are destroyed; he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others\" (Job 34:25, 26). But giveth right to the poor. The poor and afflicted, the meek and humble, God vindicates. They are his special charge. So far is he from favouring the ungodly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous. Under no circumstances does God cease to keep an eye upon the righteous, as Job had seemed to imply when he exclaimed, \"Oh that I were as in months of old, in the days when God preserved me!\" or \"watched me!\" (Job 29:2). \"The eyes of the Lord are\" always \"upon the righteous, as his ears are open unto their cry\" (Psalm 34:15). With kings are they on the throne. In some cases, God shows his care of the righteous by \"setting them with princes, even with the princes of his people\" (Psalm 113:8), raising them, that is, to high station, and making them companions of the great of the earth. Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. They are permanently established in their high positions, like Joseph and Mordecai and Daniel; and they are exalted to the highest pitch of prosperity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction. On the other hand, there are doubtless cases where the righteous suffer adversity - are even \"bound in fetters,\" and \"holden in cords of affliction\" (Genesis 39:20; Jeremiah 40:1: Daniel 3:21; Matthew 14:3; Acts 12:6; Acts 16:24; Acts 24:27, etc.). But even here God's vigilance is not relaxed. On the contrary, he watches with the utmost care over their afflictions, apportioning them according to the needs of each, and making every possible effort, by means of them, to work their reformation (see the two following verses).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then he sheweth them their work. God, by his chastisements, makes men see what has been faulty in their life's work, in what respects they have been negligent, where they have lapsed into actual sin. Signal afflictions are a call to men to \"consider their ways,\" and search out the nature of their offences. Some afflictions, as sickness and imprisonment, by depriving men of active employment, almost force them to engage in such a retrospect. And their transgressions that they have exceeded; rather, and their transgressions wherein they have behaved themselves proudly (compare the Revised Version). In all sin, as it is a contempt of God's Law, there is an element of pride. The temptation to pride especially besets those whose conduct is, in outward appearance, correct and virtuous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10 - He openeth also their ear to discipline. It is the especial merit of Elihu's theory of suffering that he views it as far less penal than disciplinary and restorative. Job's sufferings especially he views in this light. Instead of looking upon Job, like his other friends, as a heinous sinner, upon whom Go, I is taking vengeance, he regards him as a person who is being chastised, in love, for some fault or faults that he has committed, to his ultimate advantage and improvement. This, though not exactly the truth, is far nearer the truth than the view taken by the other three \"friends.\" And commandeth that they return from iniquity. God's chastisements are to be viewed as commands to men to \"go and sin no more.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures (comp. Job 12:13-19; Jeremiah 7:23; Jeremiah 26:13). Under the old covenant, prosperity was promised to the righteous, and even to the repentant, frequently, and in the most definite terms. Under the new, when any such promise is made, it is carefully guarded (Mark 10:30); while in many passages the promise is of an opposite character - the righteous are told to expect tribulations and persecutions (John 16:33; Acts 14:22; 2 Timothy 3:12: Hebrews 12:1-11; 1 Peter 4:12, 13, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword. Not, necessarily, by a material sword, but by the sword of God's vengeance, which slays in a thousand different manners, piercing through all obstacles, and reaching to the heart and spirit. And they shall die without knowledge. Either without knowing that they are about to die, or in their wilful ignorance of God's intentions in chastising them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. In his vindication of God's justice, Elihu here passes from the case of the righteous (ver. 7) to that of the \"hypocrites,\" or rather the ungodly. They, he says, \"heap up wrath,\" i.e. \"treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath\" (Romans 2:5), continually intensify God's anger against them, and, as it were, lay in a store of it, which will one day be outpoured upon them. They cry not when he bindeth them. They do not cry to him, they do not deprecate his anger, when they first find themselves bound with the \"cords of affliction\" (ver. 8), but allow his wrath to increase and accumulate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They die in youth; literally, their soul dieth in youth. The result is that, while they are still young, the vital strength of their soul is sapped; they \"come to a premature end, like youths who have destroyed the spring of life by licentiousness\" (Cook). And their life is among the unclean. (On the particular \"uncleanness\" intended, see Deuteronomy 23:17.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He delivereth the poor in his affliction; rather, he delivereth the afflicted by his affliction (see the Revised Version). Elihu recurs to what he had said in ver. 10 with respect to the discipline of affliction. The bulk of the afflictions sent by God are, according to him, intended to act medicinally. If the afflicted man receives them aright, they are the very means of his deliverance (comp. Psalm 119:67, 71; Hebrews 12:11). And openeth their ears in oppression; rather, by suffering. Their sufferings lead them to God, cause them to pay more attention to his Word, lead them to open their ears to his inward voice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad pine, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. Another quite different interpretation has been proposed by Ewald, and adopted by Dillmann and Canon Cook, who suppose Elihu to speak, not of what would have happened to Job under certain circumstances, but of what had actually happened to him, and render, \"Thee moreover hath thy unbounded prosperity seduced from listening to the voice of affliction, and the case of thy table which was full of fatness.\" But the rendering of the Authorized Version, which is substantially that of Schultens and Rosenmuller, is still upheld by many scholars, and has been retained by our Revisers. If we adopt it, we must understand Elihu as assuring Job that he too would have been delivered and restored to his prosperity, if he had accepted his afflictions in a proper spirits and learnt the lesson they were intended to teach him (see vers. 9, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked; i.e. but, as thou hast not so acted, the result has been different. Thy hardness and impenitence have brought upon thee the judgments reserved by God for the wicked - judgment and justice take hold on thee - thou art suffering the just penalty of thy obstinacy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke. The original is exceedingly obscure, and three or four quite distinct renderings have been proposed; but one of the latest critics (Professor Stanley Loathes) prefers to all the other translations that of the Authorized Version. Job is threatened by Elihu with a coming judgment which shall remove him from the earth altogether. Then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. Once let destruction fall, and there is no longer any place for ransom. Nothing can then deliver thee from thy just punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Will he esteem thy riches! rather, Will thy riches suffice? (Revised Version); or Will they stand the shock of battle? (Schultens). Will they be a sufficient strength to thee in the time of trouble? No, not gold. This rendering is now generally given up, and the words, lo betsar (לא בצר), are taken in connection with the preceding sentence, thus: Will thy riches suffice that thou be not in distress? or, in other words, Will they keep thee out of trouble? If not, will all the forces of thy strength suffice to do so? Assuredly, nothing will avail against the \"stroke\" of God (ver. 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDesire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Desire not the night, when people (rather, peoples) are cut off in their place. This is an allusion to Job's repeatedly expressed desire to be cut off at once, and laid in the grave (Job 6:9; Job 7:15; Job 14:13, etc.). Elihu holds that such a desire is wrongful. It certainly implies a want of complete resignation to the Divine will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Take heed, regard not iniquity; i.e. be on thy guard. Whilst thou art careful to preserve thy integrity and faith in God, do not fall into sin in other respects - as by impatient desires, or proud thoughts, or rash accusations of God. For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. Rather than acquiesce in thy afflictions and bear them patiently, thou hast elected to murmur, to complain, to question the justice of God, and speak overboldly concerning him. There is some ground for Elihu's condemnation; but it is excessive; it fails to make allowance for the extremity of Job's sufferings, and the disturbing influence of extreme suffering on the mind and judgment. It is, at any rate, more severe than God's judgment upon his servant (Job 38:2; Job 42:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Behold, God exalteth by his power; rather, behold, God doeth loftily in his power (see the Revised Version). Who teacheth like him? This has been called \"the key-note of Elihu's whole discourse\" (Cook). The entire providential government of the world by God he views as didactic, as a series of moral lessons addressed to men by their Maker (see Job 33:14, 16; Job 35:11; Job 36:9, etc.). If the lessons intended are taken to heart, then all goes well with men; if they are rejected, then very sad and terrible results follow (Job 36:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Who hath enjoined him his way? (comp. Job 34:13). While God is thus the universal and all-perfect Teacher, there are some who would fain instruct him, dictate the course which he ought to pursue, improve and amend his universe. Something of this spirit has appeared in Job's remonstrances, which seem to insinuate that the Divine government of the world might be carried on better than it is (see Job 9:22-24; Job 10:3; Job 13:20-26; Job 16:11-17, etc.). Elihu's intention is to reprove Job for his presumption. Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? Job has not said this; but he has gone near to saying it (Job 9:24; Job 10:3; Job 21:7-26; Job 24:2-12, etc.); compare the comment on Job 34:5-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Remember that thou magnify his work. Instead of murmuring, Job should \"magnify God's work.\" He should recognize the mercy of God, even in his own afflictions, and praise him for it. Which men behold. Men are looking on, anxiously considering Job's sufferings; he is a spectacle to them, as the apostles were to men and angels (1 Corinthians 4:9), and the more reason therefore that he should, by patient endurance, by submission and confession, cause his sufferings to redound to the glory and honour of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man may see it; man may behold it afar off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Every man may see it; rather, sees it, or has seen it. Man may behold it afar off; rather, beholds it, or has beheld it, from afar. Job's afflictions have drawn all eyes upon them - not only those of his neighbours, but of many who look on \"from afar.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-33. - Elihu passes now to a description, which must be allowed to be eloquent, of the power and providence of God, and especially of his power in the natural world. It is suggested that the storm, which ultimately broke at the theophania (Job 38:1), was already beginning to gather, and turned the thoughts of Elihu in this direction. He begins with the consideration of how rain is generated, passes rapidly to the gathering of the clouds from all quarters, and thence to the loud crashing of the thunder, and the dazzling flashes of the lightning, which illumine even the lowest depths of the sea (ver. 30). The effects of the storm are then spoken of, in words the exact meaning of which is very obscure (vers. 31-33). Verse 26. - Behold, God is great, and we know him not. This is the final lesson which Elihu seeks to impress on his hearers. God is so great their fully to comprehend him transcends the power of the human understanding. However much we know of him, there is more that we do not know. His nature is unsearchable; his depths (1 Corinthians 2:10) are inscrutable; try as we may, we can never \"find him out\" (Job 37:23). Neither can the number of his years be searched out. Even his duration, being eternal, is beyond us. We cannot realize the thought of pre- and post-eternity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - For he maketh small the drops of water; rather, he drawth up the drops of water; i.e. by the heat of his sun he causes exhalations to arise from the sea and the moist earth, and draws them up into the higher regions of the atmosphere, where they are condensed into clouds, that hang suspended in the air. They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof; literally, they flow down as rain for his mist. The water collected in the clouds flows down in the shape of rain for the purpose of watering the earth (see Genesis 2:6, where the same word (אד) occurs).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. All is done for man, for his benefit and advantage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds? The rapid generation of clouds, their gathering together, seemingly, from all quarters, and the way they almost suddenly overspread the heavens (1 Kings 18:45). are among the most remarkable phenomena of nature, and are very difficult to \"understand\" and account for. Or the noise of his tabernacle. The awful crash of the thunder, which echoes along the sky - God's \"tabernacle,\" or pavilion (Psalm 18:11) - is, if not as inexplicable, even more fearful and astounding. Man shrinks and quails before the terrible sound, and feels himself in the presence of a mighty and inscrutable power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it. God flashes the weird brilliance of his lightning over the heaven - not over himself, as some translate (Rosenmuller, Cook). He lights up the whole sky at once with the electric splendour, and even covereth with it the bottom (literally, the roots) of the see. This is, of course, hyperbole; but it seems to be Elihu's meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For by them judgeth he the people. By his clouds God works two opposite effects. On the one hand, he executes judgment upon the peoples, destroying their crops, causing widespread ruin by inundations, smiting and slaying numbers with his thunderbolts; on the other, he giveth meat in abundance, restoring to the parched earth its fertility by means of copious and refreshing showers, stimulating vegetation, and so furthering the harvest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - With clouds he covereth the light; rather, he covereth both his hands with light, i.e. with the lightning. So Vul was represented in Assyrian and Zeus in Greek mythology, as filling their hands with thunderbolts, and hurling them upon their foes in their wrath. And commandeth it not to shine, etc. This rendering is wholly indefensible. Translate, And layeth command upon it that it strike the mark (compare the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob36:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The noise thereof showeth concerning it; or, concerning him. The loud crash proclaims the fierceness of God's anger. The cattle also concerning the vapour; rather, it sheweth the cattle also concerning him that goeth up; i.e. the very cattle also feel that God is in the storm, rides upon it, and \"goeth up\" (comp. Psalm 47:5). The rendering of the Revised Version, \"(it showeth) the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up,\" is very weak, and unworthy of such an orator as Elihu.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.37":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-24. - It has been already remarked that there is no natural division between ch. 36 and ch. 37. - the description of the thunderstorm and its effects runs on. From its effect on cattle, Elihu passes to its effect on man (vers. 1-5); and thence goes on to speak of other natural manifestations of God's power and marvellousness - snow, violent rain, whirlwind, frost, and the like (vers. 6-13). He then makes a final appeal to Job to acknowledge his own weakness and God's perfection and unsearchableness, and to bow down in wonder and adoration before him (vers. 14-24). Verse 1. - At this also; i.e. at the thunderstorm or at the particular crash mentioned in Job 36:33. My heart trembleth. A violent peal of thunder produces in almost all men a certain amount of nervous trepidation. Elihu seems to have been abnormally sensitive. His heart trembled so that it seemed to be moved out of his place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth; or, Hearken ye, hearken ye to the noise of his voice (comp. Psalm 77:18: 104:7; and below, vers. 4, 5). We need not suppose Elihu to speak otherwise than poetically. He does not, like the Indian ofNEWLINENEWLINE\"... untutored mind,NEWLINESee God in clouds or hear him in the wind.\" He does not mean that the thunder is actually God's voice, but that it tells of him, reminds of him, brings naturally to men's minds the thought of his marvellous greatness and power, and should therefore be listened to with awe and trembling, not passed over lightly, like any other sound.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He directeth it under the whole heaven. The reverberations of the thunderclap roll along the entire cloud-canopy, from one end of the heavens to the other, beginning often faint in the distance, then growing loud over our heads, finally sinking into low muttered rumblings on the far horizon. And his lightning unto the ends of the earth. Similarly, the lightning, though originating in a flash at some definite spot, sets the whole sky aglow, shining from side to side of the heavens, and, as it were, to the very \"ends of the earth.\" Both have a character of universality which is marvellous, and which makes them fitting emblems of him of whom they are the messengers and ministers (see Matthew 24:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - After it a voice roareth. After the lightning-flash has been seen, the thunderclap comes. In their origin they are simultaneous; but, as light travels faster than sound, unless we are close to the flash, then is an interval, the thunder following on the lightning. He thundereth with the voice of his excellency (see the comment on ver. 2). And he will not stay them when his voice is heard. The words are plain, but the meaning is obscure. What will not God stay? His lightnings? His thunderings? His rain? His hail? There is no obvious antecedent. And in what sense will he not \"stay\" them? Some explain, \"He will not slacken their speed; \"others, \"He will not cause them to Cease.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - God thundereth marvellously with his voice. In finishing off his description of the thunderstorm, Elihu dwells upon its marvellousness. Each step in the entire process is strange and wonderful, beyond man's comprehension; and the lesson to be drawn from the consideration of the whole series of phenomena is that great things doeth he (i.e. God), which we cannot comprehend. Even after all that has been done of late years to advance the science of meteorolegy, it cannot be said that the rationale of storms is fully grasped by the scientific intellectNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth. The phenomenon of snow is always full of marvel to an Oriental. It comes before him so seldom; it is in itself so strange; it involves things so inexplicable as the sudden solidification of a liquid, crystallization, a marked expansion of bulk, and the sudden assumption by what was colourless of a definite and dazzling colour. In Arabia and the countries bordering on Palestine snow very seldom falls; but in Palestine itself the mountain ranges of Lebanon and Hermon are never without it; and in the region occupied by Job and his friends then is reason to believe that ice and snow were not altogether infrequent (see Job 6:16, and the comment ad loc). Likewise to the small rain; or, to the light shower of rain - \"the spring rain,\" as the Chaldee paraphrast explains it. And to the great rain of his strength; or, \"the heavy winter rain,\" according to the same authority. \"The former and the latter rain\" - the rain of winter, and the rain of spring - are often mentioned by the sacred writers (see Deuteronomy 11:14; Jeremiah 5:24; Hosea 6:3; Joel 2:23; Zechariah 10:1; James 5:7). God gave both, ordinarily, in due course.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He sealeth up the hand of every man. In the winter season, when the snow falls, and the heavy rains pour down (ver. 6), God \"seeleth up the hand of every man;\" i.e. puts an end to ordinary out-of-doors labour, and establishes a time of pause or rest (comp. Homer, 'II.,' 17:549). He does this with the object that all men may know his work; i.e. that, during the time of their enforced idleness, men may have leisure for reflection, and may employ it in meditating upon him and his marvellous \"work.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. Then (i.e. in winter) the beasts go into dens. The very beasts shut themselves up, and remain hidden in their places, i.e in their lairs, on account of the inclemency of the season.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Out of the south cometh the whirlwind; rather, out of the secret chamber - the storehouse where God keeps his tempests. Nothing is said of \"the south\" here, though elsewhere, no doubt, whirlwinds are said to come especially from that quarter (see Isaiah 21:1 and Zechariah 9:14). And cold out of the north; rather, and cold from the scatterers. \"The scatterers\" seem to be the violent winds which clear the heavens of clouds, and bring in a clear frosty atmosphere. Or the word used may designate a constellation (comp. Job 38:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - By the breath of God frost is given (comp. Psalm 147:16-18). \"The breath of God,\" which is a metaphor for the will of God, causes alike both frost and thaw. And the breadth of the waters is straitened; or, congealed. A broad expanse of water is suddenly turned by frost into a stiff and solid mass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud; rather, also with moisture he ladeth the thick cloud. Elihu returns from his description of the winter season to the more ordinary condition of things. Rain is the chief necessity of Eastern countries; and God is ever providing it, causing moisture to be drawn up from earth and sea, and safely lodged in the clouds, whence it descends, as needed, and as commanded by God, upon the fields and plains that man cultivates. He scattereth his bright cloud. Most commentators see a reference to lightning here; and it is possible, no doubt, that such a reference is intended. \"His bright cloud\" - literally, \"the cloud of his light\" - may mean \"the cloud in which his lightning is stored.\" But perhaps no more is meant than that God spreads abroad over the earth the clouds on which his sunlight rests. The genial showers of spring fall generally from clouds that are, in part at any rate, steeped in the sun's rays.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And it is turned round about by his counsels, \"It\" (i.e. the cloud) is \"turned round\" (or directed in its course) \"by his counsels,\" or under the guidance of his wisdom, and so conveys his rain whither he pleases. That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. There is no expressed antecedent to \"they.\" Perhaps the showers are intended, or the atmospheric influences generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. God has different purposes in directing the rain hither or thither. Sometimes his object is to punish by violent or excessive rainfall: sometimes it is to fertilize his own special land; sometimes it is out of kindness to men generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-24. - Elihu ends with a personal appeal to Job, based on the statements which he has made. Can Job imagine that he understands the workings of God in nature? If not, how can he venture to challenge God to a controversy? Would it not be better to recognize that his ways are inscrutable? Verse 14. - Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. Consider the marvels of God's works in nature, as I have set them forth to thee (Job 36:27-33; Job 37:2-13); the mysteries of evaporations, of cloud formation and accumulation, of thunder, of lightning, of snow and frost, of genial showers and fierce downpours, of summer and winter, of the former rain and the latter, of the gentle breeze and the whirlwind; and then say if thou comprehendest the various processes, and canst explain them, and make others to understand them (ver. 19). If not, shouldest thou not own, as we do, that \"we cannot find him out\" (ver. 23), cannot reach to the depths of his nature, and therefore are unfit to pronounce judgment on his doings?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Dost thou know when God disposed them; rather, disposes them - gives them their orders, arranges for their course and sequence? Or dost thou know when he caused (or rather, causes) the light of his cloud (either the lightning, or perhaps the rainbow, as Schultens suggests) to shine Thou canst not pretend to any such knowledge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds? i.e. \"how they are poised and suspended in the sky\" (Stanley Loathes). The wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge (comp. Job 36:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? Dost thou even know how it is that, while the breeze from the north chills thee (vers. 9, 10), the breath from the south makes thee feel thy garments too warm? If thou canst not explain a physical matter, wherein thine own comfort is concerned, how much less canst thou comprehend the workings of God in his moral universe!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Hast thou with him spread out the sky? Didst thou assist in the spreading out of the sky, that great and magnificent work of the Creator, transcending almost all others (see the comment on Job 9:8)? Or did not God effect this work alone, without even a counsellor (Isaiah 40:13, 14), so that thou hadst no part in it? Which is strong, and as a molten looking-glass. The sky is \"strong\" or \"firm;\" i.e. enduring or permanent, though not really hard like a mirror. Elihu, however, seems to have regarded it, like many of the ancients, as a solid mass, resembling a concave mirror of metal. The translation, \"looking-glass,\" is wrong, both here and in Exodus 38:8, since glass was not used for mirrors until the period of the early Roman empire. The earlier mirrors were of polished metal (see Smith's 'Dict. of Antiquities,' vol. 3. pp. 1052, 1212).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTeach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Teach us what we shall say unto him. Elihu indulges in irony. If thou art so wise as thou pretendest to be, then he pleased to \"teach us.\" We acknowledge our ignorance - we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. Enlighten us, if thou canst.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Shall it be told him that I speak? rather, that I would speak (comp. Job 31:35). Job had expressed the wish that God would \"hear him, and answer him.\" Elihu, intending to rebuke this presumption, yet shrinking from doing so directly, puts himself in Job's place, and asks, \"Would it be fitting that I should demand to speak with God?\" If not, it cannot be fitting that Job should do so. If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. This is probably the true meaning, though another has been suggested by some commentators, who prefer to render, \"Or should a man wish that he were destroyed?\" (So Ewald, Dillmann, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.) If we adopt this rendering, we must understand Elihu as appending to his first rebuke a second, levelled against Job's desire to have his life ended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds; rather, and now men cannot behold the light which is bright in the skies. Now, i.e., here in this world, men cannot look straight at the sun, since he dazzles them. How much less, then, would they be able to face God on his throne in heaven! Yet this is what Job had proposed to do (Job 9:32-35; Job 13:18-22; Job 22:3-7, etc.). But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them; rather, when the wind passeth and cleareth them; i.e. when, the wind having swept away the clouds and cleared the sky the sun shines forth in all its splendour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Fair weather cometh out of the north; literally, out of the north cometh gold. The bearing of this is very obscure, whether we suppose actual gold to he meant, or the golden splendours of the sun, or any other bright radiance. No commentator has hit on a satisfactory explanation. With God is terrible majesty. This is sufficiently plain, and it is the point whereto all Elihu's later argument has been directed (see Job 36:22-33; Job 37:1-18). God's majesty is so great that men can only tremble before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTouching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out. This is the \"conclusion of the whole matter.\" God is inscrutable, and man must hide his face before him and not presume to judge him. He is also excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice. His moral perfection is on a par with his might and majesty. He will not afflict; rather, he will not answer; i.e. he will not account to men for his doings, or condescend to justify himself in their eyes. His acts cannot but be righteous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob37:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Men do therefore fear him; or, let men therefore fear him. Let them see in his unsearchableness, his almighty power, his absolute moral perfection, and his superiority to all human questioning, ample grounds for the profoundest reverence and fear. And let them remember that he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. However \"wise of heart\" men may be, God does not \"respect\" them, at any rate to the extent of submitting his conduct to their judgment, and answering their clues-tionings (see ver. 20).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.38":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind. It is remarked, with reason, that the special mention of Job as the person answered \"implies that another speaker had intervened\" (Wordsworth); while the attachment of the article to the word \"whirlwind\" implies some previous mention of that phenomenon, which is only to be found in the discourse of Elihu (Job 37:9). Both points have an important bearing on the genuineness of the disputed section, ch. 32- 37. And said. The question whether there was an objective utterance of human words out of the whirlwind, or only a subjective impression of the thoughts recorded on the minds of those present, is unimportant. In any case, there was a revelation direct from God, which furnished an authoritative solution of the questions debated to all who had been engaged in the debate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? It is very noticeable that God entirely ignores the reasonings of Elihu, and addresses himself, in the first instance, wholly to Job, with whom he begins by remonstrating. Job has not been without fault. He has spoken many \"words without knowledge\" or with insufficient knowledge, and has thus trenched on irreverence, and given the enemies of God occasion to blaspheme. Moreover, he has \"darkened counsel.\" Instead of making the ways of God clear to his friends and companions, he has east doubts upon God's moral government (Job 21:7-26), upon his mercy and loving-kindness (Job 16:7-14), almost upon his justice (Job 19:7; Job 31:1-35). He is thus open to censure, and receives censure, and owns himself \"vile\" (Job 40:4), before peace and reconciliation can be established.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Gird up now thy loins like a man. Job had desired to contend with God, to plead with him, and argue out his case (Job 9:32-35; Job 13:3, 18-22; Job 23:4-7; Job 31:35). God now offers to grant his request, and bids him stand forth \"as a man'\" and \"gird himself\" for the contest, which he has challenged. For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. He will begin with interrogatories which Job must answer; then Job will be entitled to put questions to him. Job, however, on the opportunity being given him, shrinks back, and says, \"Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken: but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further\" (Job 40:4, 5). The confident boldness which he felt when God seemed far off disappears in his presence, and is replaced by diffidence and distrust.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Wast thou present? Didst thou witness it? If not, what canst thou know concerning it? And if thou knowest nothing of creation, what canst thou know of deeper things? The metaphor, by which the creation of the earth is compared to the foundation of an edifice, is a common one (Psalm 102:25; Psalm 104:5; Proverbs 8:29: Isaiah 48:13; Isaiah 51:13, 16; Zechariah 12:1; Hebrews 1:10, etc.), and is to be viewed as a concession to human weakness, creation itself, as it actually took place, being inconceivable. Declare, if thou hast understanding. That is, if thou hast any knowledge on the subject (comp. ver. 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Who determined the measures thereof? Everything in creation is orderly, measured, predetermined, governed by law and will The actual weight of the planets is fixed by Divine wisdom, with a view to the stability and enduringness of the solar system (comp. Isaiah 40:12). If thou knowest; literally, for thou knowest - an anticipation of the lofty irony which comes out so remarkably in ver. 21. Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Human builders determine the dimensions of their constructions by means of a measuring-line (Ezekiel 40:3-49, etc.). The writer carries out his metaphor of a building by supposing a measuring-rod to have been used at the creation of the earth also. Some find a trace of the idea in Genesis 1:9, where they translate קָווּ הַמַּיִם, \"Let the waters be marked out with a line.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? These details follow naturally upon the adoption of the particular metaphor of a house or building. They are not to be pressed. The object is to impress on Job his utter ignorance of God's ways in creation. Or who laid the corner-stone thereof? Who gave the last finishing touch to the work (see Psalm 118:22; Zechariah 4:7)? Canst thou tell? If not, why enter into controversy with the Creator?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - When the morning stars sang together. The stars generally, or the actual stars visible on the morn of creation, are probably meant. They, as it were, sang a song of loud acclaim on witnessing the new marvel. Their priority to the earth is implied, since they witness its birth. Their song is, of course, that silent song of sympathy, whereof Shakespeare speaks when he says, \"Each in its motion like an angel sings\" ('Merchant of Venice,' act 5. sc. 1). And all the sons of God shouted for joy. \"The sons of God\" here must necessarily be the angels (see Job 1:6; Job 2:1), since there were no men as yet in existence. They too joined in the chorus of sympathy and admiration, perhaps lifting up their voices (Revelation 5:11, 12), perhaps their hearts only, praising the Creator, who had done such marvellous things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Or who shut up the sea with doors? From the earth a transition is made to the sea, as the second great wonder in creation (comp. Genesis 1:9, 10; Exodus 20:11; Psalm 104:24, 25). God's might is especially shown in his power to control and confine the sea, which rages so terribly and seems so utterly uncontrollable. God has blocked it in \"with doors\" - i.e. with \"bounds that it cannot pass, neither turn again to cover the earth\" (Psalm 145:9). Sometimes the barrier is one of lofty and solid rock, which seems well suited to confine and restrain; but sometimes it is no more than a thin streak of sliver sand or a bank of loose, shifting pebbles. Yet, in both cases alike, the restraint suffices. \"The sand is placed for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it\" (Jeremiah 5:22); the beach of shifting pebbles remains as firm as the rock itself, and never recedes or advances more than a few feet. When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb; i.e. at its birth, when it was first formed, by the gathering together of the waters into one place (see Genesis 1:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When I made the cloud the garment thereof. The account of creation here given is certainly not drawn wholly from Genesis It is to be viewed as a second, independent, account of the occurrences, in fuller detail, but vaguer, by reason of the poetical phraseology. And thick darkness a swaddllng-band for it. The infant sea, just come from the womb (ver. 8), is represented as clothed with a cloud, and swaddled in thick darkness, to mark its complete subjection to its Creator from the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And brake up for it my decreed place; rather, as in the margin, and established my decree upon it; or, as in the Revised Version, and prescribed for it my decree. The decree itself is given in ver. 11. And set bars and doors (see above, ver. 8, where the imagery of \"doors\" has been already introduced). As Professor Lee observes, \"The term דְּלָתַיִם contains a metaphor taken from the large folding-doors of a city, which are usually set up for the purpose of stepping the progress of an invading enemy, and are hence supplied with bolts and bars\" ('Book of Job,' p. 490). Representations of such folding-doors are common in the Assyrian sculptures; and in one instance the doors themselves, or, to speak more exactly, their outer bronze easing, has been recovered (see a paper in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' on the Bronze Gates discovered by Mr. Rassam at Balawat, vol. 7. pp. 85-115). These gates were twenty-two feet high and six feet broad each.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And said, Hitherto shalt thou corns, but no further. The law is not quite absolute. Wherever the sea washes a coast-line, there is a continual erosive action, whereby the land is, little by little, eaten away, and the line of the coast thrust back. But the action is so slow that millennia pass without any considerable effect being produced, and encroachments in some places are generally counterbalanced by retrenchment in others, so that the general contour of laud and water, with the proportion of the one to the other, remain probably very much the same at the present day as when the earth first became the habitation of man. And here shall thy proud waves be stayed. The waves of the sea \"rage horribly,\" and every now and then topple down a rock or undermine a cliff, and seem proud of their achievements; but how little do they effect, even in thousands of years! The little islet of Psyttaleia still blocks the eastern end of the straits of Salamis. The Pharos island lies off the westernmost mouth of the Nile. Even the low, fiat Aradus, on the Syrian coast, has not been swept away. Everywhere the waves are practically \"stayed,\" and all the menaces of the sea against the land come to nought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days? rather, by reason of ray length of days - a similar irony to that observable in vers. 5, 21, etc. The third marvel of creation brought before us is the dawn, or daybreak - that standing miracle of combined utility and beauty. Has Job authority to issue his orders to the dawn, and tell it when to make its appearance? Has he caused the dayspring to know his place? Job cannot possibly pretend to any such power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? The idea seems to he that the dawn, suddenly appearing, seizes hold of all the ends of the earth \"at one rush\" (Canon Cook), and lights up the whole terrestrial region. The wicked, lovers of darkness, are taken by surprise, and receive a shock from which they recover with difficulty (comp. Job 24:16, 17). That they are \"shaken from the earth\" must be regarded as Oriental hyperbole.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - It is turned as clay to the seal; rather, it changes as the clay of a seal. The seals of the Babylonians, Assyrians, and others were commonly impressed upon clay, and not upon wax (Lsyard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 153-156). As the seal changed the clay from a dull, shapeless lump to a figured surface, so the coming of the dawn changes the earth from an indistinct mass to one diversified with form and colour. As M. Renan explains, \"L'aurore fair our la terre l'effet d'un sceau sur la torte sigillee, en dormant de laforme, et du relief, a la surface do l'univers, qui pendant la nuit est somme un chaos indistinct.\" And they stand as a garment; rather, and things stand out as a garment or as on a garment - a richly embroidered dress is intended, on which the pattern stands out in relief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And from the wicked their light is withholden. Then, when the dawn bursts forth, \"from the wicked, their light\"-which is darkness (Job 24:13-17) - \"is withholden,\" and the consequence is that the high arm - the arm that is proud and lifted up - shall be broken. Detection and punishment fall upon the wicked doers who are surprised by the daylight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? The emphasis is on the word \"springs,\" which means sources, origin, or deepest depths (see the Septuagint, which has πηγή, and the Vulgate, which has profunda). Canst thou go to the bottom of anything, explore its secrets, explain its cause and origin? Or hast thou walked in the search (rather, the deep places) of the depth? Art thou not as ignorant as other men of all these remote and secret things? Physical science is now attempting the material exploration of the ocean-depths, but \"deep-sea dredgings\" bring us no nearer to the origin, cause, or mode of creation of the great watery mass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? By \"the gates of death,\" Sheol, the abode of the dead, seems to be intended (comp. Job 10:21, 22; Job 17:16). Has Job explored this region, and penetrated its secrets? Or is it as unknown to him as to the rest of mankind? The second hemistich - Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? - is a mere echo of the first, adding an new idea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? literally, the breadths; i.e. the dimensions generally. The exact dimensions are probably not even yet known. Job can scarcely have had any conception of them. To him the earth was probably a vast plain, extended, he knew not how far, in all directions. Declare if thou knowest it all (comp. vers. 4, 5, and 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Where is the way where light dwelleth? or, Which is the way to the dwelling-place of light '? Where, i.e.' does light dwell? What is its original and true home? Light is a thing quite distinct from the sun and moon and planets (Genesis 1:3, 16). Where and what is it? Dost thou know the way to its dwelling-place? If not, why, once more, dost thou pretend to search out the deep things of God? And as for darkness, where is the place thereof? Darkness, too, light's antithesis, must not that have a home - a \"place\" of abode, as Job himself had postulated, when he spoke of \"a land of darkness and the shadow of death, a land of darkness as darkness itself... Where the light is as darkness\" (Job 10:21, 22)? If so, can Job point out the locality?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof. Can Job \"take\" light and darkness, and lead them to their proper places, and make them observe their proper \"bounds,\" as God can (Genesis 1:4)? And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof (comp. ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? The irony that has underlain the whole address comes here to the surface, and shows itself palpably. Job, of course, is as old as the Almighty, or, at any rate, coeval with creation; otherwise he could not presume to take the tone which he has taken, and arraign the moral government of the Creator. Or because the number of thy days is great! Compare the sarcasm of Eliphaz (Job 15:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? The \"treasures of the snow\" are the storehouses, wherein the snow is, poetically, supposed to be laid up. Vast accumulations of snow actually exist in various portions of the earth's surface, but the fresh snow that falls is not taken from these treasuries, but newly generated by the crystallization of floating vapours in the atmosphere. Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail! This expression is to be explained similarly, as poetical. Hail is nowhere kept in store. It is generated by the passage of rain-drops through a layer of freezing air.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Which I have reserved against the time of trouble. Hail is reckoned throughout Scripture as one of the ministers of the Divine vengeance (see Exodus 9:18-29; Exodus 10:5-15; Joshua 10:11; Psalm 18:12, 13; Psalm 78:47, 48; Psalm 105:32; Isaiah 30:30; Isaiah 32:19; Ezekiel 13:11, 13; Ezekiel 36:22; Haggai 2:17; Revelation 8:7; Revelation 11:19; Revelation 16:21). Its destructive effect upon crops, even in temperate latitudes, is indicated by the insurances against damage from hail, which, even in our own country, so many farmers think it worth their while to pay. In tropical and semi-tropical regions the injury caused by hailstorms is far greater. Against the day of battle and war. Compare especially Joshua 10:11, which, however, we need not suppose to have been in the mind of the writer. In ancient times, when the bow held the place in war which is now occupied by the rifle or the musket, a heavy hailstorm, striking full in the face of the combatants on one side, while it only fell on the backs of their adversaries, must of tea have decided a battle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - By what way is the light parted? or, distributed, so as to be enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the earth (Stanley Loathes). Which scattereth, etc.; rather, or by what way is the east wind scattered over the earth? (see the Revised Version) Job is asked to explain God's modus operandi in nature, which, of course, he cannot do. Hence his answer in Job 40:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Who hath divided a water-course for the overflowing of waters? rather, as in the Revised Version, Who hath cleft a channel for the water-flood? i.e. Who has furrowed and seamed the ground (in Western Asia) with deep gullies, or \"water-courses,\" for the rapid carrying off of the violent rains to which those regions are subject? The wadies of Syria and Arabia seem to be alluded to. They too are God's work, not Job's. Or a way for the lightning of thunder? The \"way\" for the passage of the electric current is not marked out beforehand, like the way for the escape of the superfluous waters; but it is equally determined on and arranged previously by God, who has laid down the laws which it is bound to follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man. God not only causes his rain to fall equally on the just and on the unjust (Matthew 5:45), but equally, or almost equally, on inhabited lauds and uninhabited. His providence does not limit itself to supplying the wants of man, but has tender regard to the beasts, and birds, and reptiles, and insects which possess the lands whereon man has not yet set his foot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - To satisfy the desolate and waste ground. Parched ground seems to cry aloud for water, and so to make a piteous appeal to Heaven. Perhaps rain is not wholly wasted, even on the bare sands of the Sahara, or the rugged rocks of Tierra del Fuego. It may have uses which are beyond our cognizance. And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth. Where the rain produces herbage, it is certainly of use, for wherever there is herbage there are always insects, whose enjoyment of life has every appearance of being intense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? How do rain and dew come into existence? Can Job make them, or any other man? Can man even conceive of the process by which they were made? If not, must not their Maker, who is God, be wholly inscrutable?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Out of whose womb came the ice? Modern scientists admit that the process by which a liquid is metamorphosed into a solid transcends their utmost power of thought. They know nothing more than the fact that at the temperature of 32° Fahr. water, and at other temperatures other liquids, are solidified (see an article by Professor Tyndall on the generation of a snowflake in the Contemporary Review of 1880). It is thus not only creation itself, but the transformations of created things, that transcend the scientific intellect and are inexplicable. And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? This is the same question as that of the previous clause, expressed in different wordsNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. The waters are hid as with a stone; rather, the waters are hardened like unto stone. When the frost comes, the waters are congealed and rendered as hard as stone. (So Dillmann and Canon Cook.) And the face of the deep is frozen. By \"the deep\" (תּהום) is certainly not meant here either the open ocean, which, in the latitudes known to the dwellers in South Western Asia, never freezes, or the Mediterranean. Some of the lakes which abound in the regions inhabited by Job and his friends are probably meant. These may occasionally have been thinly coated with ice in the times when the Book of Job was written (see the comment on Job 6:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades? (On the almost certain identification of the Hebrew Kirnah with the Pleiades, see the comment on Job 9:9.) Whether the \"sweet influences\" of the constellation are here spoken of is very doubtful. Schultens and Professor Lee support the rendering; but most critics prefer to translate the word employed (מעדנים) by \"chains\" or \"fastenings\" (Rashi, Kimchi, Rosenmuller, Dillmann, Canon Cook). If we adopt this view, we must suppose the invisible links which unite the stars into a constellation to be intended. Job is asked whether he can draw the links nearer together, and bind the stars closer to one another. Or loose the bands of Orion? The identity of Kesil with Orion is generally allowed. Job is asked if he can loosen the tie which unites the several members of this constellation together. Of course, he can pretend to no such powers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? The context implies that \"Mazzaroth' is a constellation on a par with the Pleiades, Orion, and the Bear (Kimah, Kesil and 'Aish). This makes it impossible to accept the meaning, so generally assigned, of \"the twelve signs of the Zodiac.\" Again, the plural form is fatal to the conjecture that \"Mazzaroth\" designates a single star or planet, as Jupiter, Venus, or Sirius (Cook). The word is derived probably from the root zahar, \"to shine,\" \"to be bright,\" and should designate some especially brilliant cluster of stars Whether it is to be regarded as a variant of Mazzaloth (2 Kings 23:5) is uncertain. Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? (On the identity of 'Ash or 'Aish with the Great Bear, see the comment on Job 9:9.) The \"sons\" of 'Aish are conjectured to be the three large stars in the tail of Ursa Major (Stanley Leathes); but the grounds on which the conjecture rests are very slight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? i.e. the physical laws by which the course of nature is governed (comp. Psalm 119:90, 91; Psalm 148:6). The general prevalence of law in the material world is quite as strongly asserted by the sacred writers as by modern science. The difference is that modern science regards the laws as physical necessities, self-subsisting, while Scripture looks upon them as the ordinances of the Divine will. This latter view involves, of course, the further result that the Divine will can at any time suspend or reverse any of its enactments. Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? If Job does not even know the laws whereby the world is governed, much less can he establish such laws himself, and make them work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of water may sever thee? Will the clouds take their orders from thee, listen to thee, obey thy voice? None but the \"medicine-men\" of savage tribes profess to have any such power. Elijah, indeed, \"prayed, and the heaven gave rain\" (James 5:18); but this was a very different thing from \"commanding the clouds of heaven.\" His prayer was addressed to God, and God gave the rain for which he made his petition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Hers we are? If Job cannot command the clouds, much less can he send (or rather, send forth) lightnings - these marvellous and terrible evidences of almighty power. Even now, with all our command of electricity, our savants would, from the best electrical ms-chine, find it difficult to produce the effects which often result from a single flash of lightning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Some refer this to human wisdom, and understand the Almighty as asking - Who has put man's wisdom into his inward parts? literally, into his kidneys, or as our idiom would express it, \"into his heart.\" But there is great difficulty in supposing a sudden transition from clouds and lightning in vers. 34, 35 to the human understanding in ver. 36, with a return to clouds and rain in ver. 37. Hence many of the best critics understand ver. 36 of the purpose and intelligence that may be regarded as existing in the clouds and rain and lightning themselves, which are God's ministers, and run to and fro at his command, and execute his pleasure. (So Schultens, Rosenmuller, Professor Lee, and Professer Stanley Leathes.) To obtain this result, we must translate the word טוּחות By \"tempest\" or \"thunder-belts,\" and the word שׂכוי, in the next clause, by \"storm n or something similar (see the Revised Version, where \"dark clouds\" is suggested as an alternative for \"inward parts'\" and \"meteor\" as an alternative for \"heart\"). The whole passage will then run thus: Who hath put wisdom in the thunderbolts? or who hath given understanding to the tempest?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Who can number the clouds in wisdom? i.e. Who is wise enough to number the clouds, and say how many they are? Or who can stay the bottles of heaven! rather, Who can pour out? (see the Revised Version). The \"bottles,\" or \"water-skins,\" of heaven are the dense clouds heavy with rain, which alternately hold the moisture like a reservoir, and pour it out upon the earth. God alone can determine when the rain shall fall.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - When the dust groweth into hardness. 'Aphar (עָפַר) here, as often, means \"earth,\" or \"soil,\" rather than \"dust.\" When by the heat of the sun's rays the ground grows into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together, baked into a compact mass, then is the time when rain is most needed, and when the Almighty in his mercy commonly sends it. The consideration of inanimate nature here ends, with the result that its mysteries altogether transcend the human intellect, and render speculation on the still deeper mysteries of the moral world wholly vain and futile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? A new departure. Ch. 39 should commence from this point. What does Job know of the habits and instincts of animals? Can he arrange so that the lion (rather, lioness) shall obtain its proper prey, and thus fill the appetite - or, satisfy the appetite (Revised Version) - of the young lions, which depend on their dam? Certainly not. \"The lions, roaring after their prey, do seek their meat from God\" (Psalm 104:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob38:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait (comp.

(comp. Luke 12:24, \"Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them\"). God's mercy is \"over all his works,\" not only over those whereof man sees the utility; but also over beasts of prey, and birds thought to be of ill omen. Especially he cares for the young of each kind, which most need protection. When his young ones cry unto God. So Psalm 147:9, \"He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.\" The young ravens are driven to cry out, when they, i.e. the parent birds, wander for lack of meat, and have a difficulty in finding it.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.39":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-30. - This chapter completes the survey of animate nature begun at Job 38:39. The habits and instincts of the wild goat, the wild ass, and wild cattle are first noticed (vers. 1-12); then a transition is made to the most remarkable of birds, the ostrich (vers. 13-18). Next, the horse is described, and, as it were, depicted, in a passage of extraordinary fire and brilliancy (vers. 19-25). Finally, a return is made to remarkable birds, and the habits of the hawk and eagle obtain mention (vers. 26-30). Throughout, the object is to show the infinite wisdom of God, and the utter incompetence of man to explain the mysteries of nature. Verse 1. - Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? The wild goats of Western Asia are of two kinds, the Capra segagrus, and the Asiatic ibex, or Capra Sinaitica. The latter is probably the animal here intended, which is called yael sela, \"the wild goat of the rocks,\" and was known to the Assyrians as ya-e-li. It is an animal with large rough horns curving backwards, closely allied to the steinbock, or bouquetin, of the Swiss and Tyrolian Alps. It is very shy and wild, difficult of approach, and inhabiting only the most rocky and desolate tracts of Syria and Arabia. Representations of the animal, which was hunted by the Assyrian kings, are common upon the Ninevite monuments (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 140. Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? \"The hinds\" here are probably the females of the species of ibex intended. The clause is therefore a mere repetition, in other words, of the preceding one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? With an animal so wild as the ibex, these secrets of nature would be difficult to observe and note down. In Job's time probably no one had made such subjects an object of inquiry. Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? This would be less difficult to observe. The breeding-time of most wild animals is known in the country which produces them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast oat their sorrows. Parturition is a pain, even to the brute creation, though, comparatively speaking, a light one. (For the figure of speech by which that which causes pain is called pain, see AEschyl., 'Agam.,' 1. 1427; Eurip., 'Ion,' 1. 45; Herod., 5:18.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Their young ones are in good liking; i.e. healthy and strong (comp. Daniel 1:10). They grow up with corn; rather, they grow up out of doors, or in the open air (see Professor Lee, ad loc; and Buxtorf, 'Lex. Hebr. et Chald.,' p. 87). They go forth, and return not unto them. They quit their dams early, and \"go forth\" to provide for themselves - an indication of health and strength.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? Two kinds of onager or wild ass, seem to be intended - the one called pore' (פִרֶא), and the other 'arod (עָרוד). These correspond probably to the Asinus hemippus and the Asinus onager of modern naturalists, the former of which is still found in the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Northern Arabia, while the latter inhabits Western Asia from 48° N.lat. southward to Persia, Beloochistan, and Western India. Sir H. A. Layard describes the former, which he saw, as a \"beautiful animal, in fleetness equalling the gazelle, very wild, and of a rich fawn colour, almost pink\" ('Nineveh and its Remains,' Vol. 1. p. 324). The latter (Asinus onager) was seen by Sir R. K. Porter in Persia ('Travels,' vol. 1. p. 460), and is described in very similar terms. The two, however, appear to be distinct species (see Dr. Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 3. pp. 19, 20, Appendix). Both animals are remarkable for extreme wildness; and all attempts to domesticate the young of either have hitherto failed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Whose house I have made the wilderness. The Mesopotamian regions inhabited by the Asinus hemippus are those vast stretches of rolling plain, treeless, producing a few aromatic shrubs and much wormwood, which intervene between the Sinjar mountain-range and the Babylonian alluvium. Here the wild ass was seen by Xenophon and the Ten Thousand, in company with ostriches, gazelles, and bustards (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:5); and here Sir Austin Layard also made its acquaintance ('Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 270). The Asians onager frequents the deserts of Khorassan and Beloochistan, which are even more barren than the Mesepotamian. And the barren land his dwellings; rather, the salt land (see the Revised Version). The great desert of Khorassan is largely impregnated with salt, and in places encrusted with it. The wild ass licks salt with avidity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He scorneth the multitude of the city. Avoids, that is, the haunts of men, and is never seen near them. Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. Nothing will induce the wild ass to submit to domestication.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The range of the mountains is his pasture. By \"mountains\" we must here understand rocky ranges like the Sinjar and the mountains of Beloochistan, or again those of the Sinaitic peninsula. Wild asses do not frequent the regions which we commonly call mountainous. And he searcheth after every green thing; i.e. he seeks out the small patches of pasture which are to be found in such rocky regions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? This is an unfortunate translation, since there is no word etymologicallly correspondent to \"unicorn\" in the original. The word used is rem or reyrn; and the rem is distinctly said in Deuteronomy 33:17 to have \"horns.\" All that is said of the rim in Scripture points to some species of wild cattle, and recent critics are almost universally agreed thus far at any rate. Assyrian investigation carries us a step further. It is found that the wild bull so often represented on the monuments as hunted by the Ninevite monarchs was known to the Assyrians by the name of rimu or rim. Careful examination of the sculptures has resulted in the identification of this animal with Bee primi-genius an extinct species, probably identical with the urns of the Romans, which Caesar saw in Gaul, and of which he has left a description. \"These uri,\" he says, \"are scarcely less than elephants in size, but in their nature, colour, and form are bulls. Great is their strength, and great their speed; nor do they spare man nor beast, when once they have caught sight of him. ... Even when they are young, they cannot be habituated to man and made tractable. The size and shape of their horns are very different from those of our own oxen\" ('De Bell. Gall.,' 6:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? That is, \"as thou bindest the ox?\" Canst thou make him plough for thee? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? Another common employment of oxen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? If a man could bind the urns to his plough or to his harrow, still he could not \"trust\" him. The huge brute would be sure to prove unmanageable, and would only cause damage to his owner. Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? As thou leavest many labours to thy oxen, confiding in their docility.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Wilt thou believe him - rather, Wilt thou confide in him (see the Revised Version) - that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barns? i.e. convey the harvest from the field to the homestead, that it may be safely lodged in thy barn. The \"strength\" of the urns (ver. 11) would make all such labours light to him, but his savage nature would render it impossible to use him for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? rather, the wing of the ostrich (literally, of ostriches) is exultant; i.e. a thing that it glories in. The allusion is, perhaps, to the flapping of its wings by the ostrich, as it hurries over the ground, which is sore, thing like that of a cock before crowing or after beating an antagonist. Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? This clause is very obscure, but may perhaps mean, Are her feathers and plumage kindly? (see the Revised Version); i.e. does she use them for the same kindly purpose as other birds - to warm her eggs, and forward the process of hatching them?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust. The best authorities tell us that in tropical countries ostriches, having scratched a hole in the sand, and deposited their eggs in it, cover the eggs over with a layer of sand, sometimes as much as a foot in thickness, and, leaving them during the daytime to be kept warm by the heat of the sun, only incubate at night. It is evidently this habit of the bird that is here alluded to. That in cooler countries ostriches do not do this is not to the point. The habit was known in Job's time, and was so noticeable as to characterize the bird to a large extent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. Where the eggs are covered by a layer of sand a foot thick, this danger is not incurred. But when the eggs are numerous - and they are sometimes as many as thirty - they are apt to be very poorly covered, and the results follow which are described in the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers. This is a deduction from what has preceded, and discloses no new fact. Recent careful observation of the habits of the ostrich indicates that the parental instinct is not wanting, though it may be weaker than in most birds. Both the male and the female incubate at night, and, when the nest is approached by the hunter, the parent bird or birds will leave it, and try to draw him away from it by running on in front of him, or feigning to attack him, much as peewits do in our own country. Her labour is in vain without fear; or, though her labour is in vain, she is without fear (see the Revised Version); i.e. though she is often disappointed of her immediate hope of offspring, through her eggs being crushed and destroyed, yet she grows no wiser, she does not fear for the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. There is an Arab proverb - \"As stupid as an ostrich\" - which the Arabs justify on five grounds:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The ostrich, they say, will swallow iron, stones, leaden bullets, and other things, which injure and sometimes prove fatal to it.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) When hunted, it thrusts its head into a hush, and iron,nee that the hunter does not see it.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It allows itself to be captured by transparent devices.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) It neglects its eggs.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) Its head is small, and contains but a small quantity of brains. To these grounds I may add that in the South-African ostrich-farms, the birds allow themselves to be confined within a certain space by a fence of sticks and string raised about a foot from the ground. They seem to think that they cannot step over it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. The ostrich sometimes tries to elude pursuit by crouching and hiding behind hillocks or in hollows, making itself as little conspicuous as possible; but, when these attempts fail, and it starts off to run in the open, then it \"lifts itself up\" to its full elevation, beats the air with its wings, and scours along at a pace that no horse can equal. The Greeks with Xenophon, though well mounted, failed to catch a single ostrich ('Anab.,' 1:5. § 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Hast thou given the horse strength? (comp. Psalm 147:10). Geburah means, however, more than \"strength.\" It includes courage and all martial excellence. Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? Many objections have been taken to this expression; and endeavours have been made to show that the word used (דַעְמָה) does not mean \"thunder,\" but\" a tremulous motion,\" \"quivering muscles and a tossing mane,\" or else \"scorn,\" \"indignation.\" But as רַעַם always means \"thunder\" (Job 26:14; Job 39:25; Psalm 77:19: 81:8; 145:7; Isaiah 29:6), it seems unlikely that רעמה means anything else. To the objection that the metaphor is \"incongruous\" (Professor Lee), it would appear to be enough to reply that one of our greatest prose-poets has seen in it peculiar fitness. So true every way\" says Carlyle, on the passage: \"true eyesight and vision for all things; material things, not less than spiritual; \"the horse - Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?\" ('Lectures on Heroes,' p. 78).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? rather, Canst thou make him leap forward as a grasshopper? The bound with which a war-horse rushes to battle seems intended. The glory of his nostrils is terrible. When the war-horse snorts, men tremble (see Jeremiah 8:16, \"The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He paweth in the valley. Canon Cook appositely compares Virgil's \"carat tellurem\" ('Georg.,' 3:87, 88), and Professor Lee Pope's expression, that \"ere they start a thousand steps are lost.\" The verb is in the plural, because a line of cavalry, all pawing and eager to be off, is intended to be represented. And rejoiceth in his strength. Nothing is more remarkable than the eagerness and joy which war-horses show when the battle approaches. They are generally more excited than their riders. He goeth on to meet the armed men; literally, he rusheth upon the weapons. Equally true in ancient and in modern warfare. The main use of cavalry is in the charge (see Denison's 'Hist. of Cavalry,' pp. 507-512).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. \"The cavalry of modern times will rush undismayed upon the line of opposing bayonets\" (Professor Lee). \"We do not believe that a body of infantry ever existed that, with the bayonet alone, unsupported by fire, could have checked the determined charge of good horsemen\" (Denison, p. 510).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The quiver rattleth against him. In the Aasyrian sculptures the quiver of mounted archers is often hung at the side, instead of at the back. In this position it would rattle against the neck of the war-horse (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2 p. 25). The glittering spear and the shield would occasionally strike against his neck or his shoulders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and. rage. This is a common metaphor to denote the rapidity with which the horse covers the space that lies before him. Virgil has, \"Corripiuut spatia\" ('AEnid,' 5:316); Silius ltalions, \"Campum volatu rapucre\" (3:308); Shakespeare, \"He seemed in running to devour the way.\" Arab poets have similar expressions (see Bochart, ' Hieroz.,' pt. 1. bk. 2. o. 8). Neither beiieveth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. (So Schultens, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.) But most recent critics prefer to render, \"He standeth not still when the trumpet soundeth,\" and compare Virgil's \"Stare loco nescit\" ('Georg.,' 3:84).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! literally, at the trumpet; i.e. at the sound of the trumpet. The utterance, \"Ha, ha!\" (heakh)' is an imitation of the horse's snort or neigh. And he smelleth the battle afar off. Not merely presages it, as Pliny Bye (\"Equi praesagiunt pugnam, 'Hist. Nat,' 8:42), or perceives it. but seems to scent it. The open and quivering nostrils raise this idea. The thunder of the captains, and the shouting. On the great noise made by advancing armies in ancient times, see 2 Kings 7:6; Isaiah 5:28-30: Jeremiah 8:16, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Doth the hawk fly (or, soar) by thy wisdom? The hawk's strength of wing is extraordinary, and one of the greatest of natural marvels. Can Job claim to have contrived it? Many as have been the attempts made, human ingenuity has not yet devised anything that can fly. And stretch her wings toward the south? Migrate, i.e., when winter approaches, to the warmer southern regions. Few things in nature are more remarkable than the instinct of migratory birds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Doth the eagle mount up at thy command? The enumeration of natural marvels ends with the eagle, the monarch of birds, as it began with the lion, the king of beasts (Job 38:39). The power of the eagle to \"mount up,\" notwithstanding its great size and weight, is very surprising. The species intended in this place is probably the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) or else the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca)' which arc both of them common in Syria and Mesopotamia. And make her nest on high? The nests of eagles are almost always built on lofty, generally on inaccessible, rocks. Aristotle says, Ποιοῦνται δεαὐτὰς (sc, τὰς νεοττίας), οὐκ ἐν πεδινοῖς τόποις ἀλλ ἐν ὑψηκοῖς μάλιστα μὲν καὶ ἐν πέτραις ἀποκρήμνοις (comp.

The craggy summits of rocks bear a resemblance to the fangs of a tooth. Hence we have in France the Dent du Chat, and in Switzerland the Dent de Jaman and the Dent du Midi.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. Aristotle gives this as a reason for the lofty flight of the eagle, Υψοῦ πέταται ὁπως ἐπὶ πλεῖστον τόπον καθορᾷ. The keen sight of the eagle is recognized by modern savants: \"Aquila, genre d'oiseaux de proie... caracterise par un bec sans denlelure et droit a sa base jusquaupres de l'extremite, ou il se corbe beaucoup; par des pieds robustes armes d'ongles aigus et tranchants, par leur rue percante et leur grands envergure\" ('Dictionnaire Universelle des Sciences,' p. 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob39:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Her young ones also suck up blood. It has been asserted that this is not the case, since they are fed on carrion (Merx). But, as eagles are known to seize fawns, hares, lambs, and other small animals, and transport them to their eyries, their young must certainly be nourished, in part, on the flesh of animals newly killed. And where the slain are, there is she (comp. Deuteronomy 21:18; Matthew 24:28; Luke 17:37). Eagles, or at any rate birds \"more resembling eagles than vultures,\" are commonly represented on the Assyrian monuments, especially in battle-scenes, where they either feed on the dead bodies of the slain, or tear out their entrails, or sometimes carry up aloft the decapitated head of some unfortunate soldier (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' vol. 8. p. 59, and pls. 2. and 3.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - After this opened Job his mouth. The first to take the word is Job, as, indeed, etiquette made necessary, when the visit paid was one of condolence. It can only be conjectured what the feelings were which had kept him silent so long. We may, perhaps, suggest that in the countenances and manner of his friends he saw something which displeased him, something indicative of their belief that he had brought his afflictions upon himself by secret sins of a heinous character. Pharisaism finds it very difficult to conceal itself; signs of it are almost sure to escape; often it manifests itself, without a word spoken, most offensively. The phrase, \"opened his mouth,\" is not to be dismissed merely as a Hebraism. It is one used only on solemn occasions, and implies the utterance of deep thoughts, well considered beforehand (Psalm 78:21; Matthew 5:2), or of feelings long repressed, and now at length allowed expression. And cursed his day; \"cursed,\" i.e., the \"day of his birth.\" Some critics think that \"cursed\" is too strong a word, and suggest \"reviled;\" but it cannot be denied that \"to curse\" is a frequent meaning of קָלַל and it is difficult to see in Job's words (vers. 3-10) anything but a \"curse\" of a very intense character. To curse one's natal day is not, perhaps, a very wise act, since it can have no effect on the day or on anything else; but so great a prophet as Jeremiah imitated Job in this respect (Jeremiah 20:14-18), so that before Christianity it would seem that men were allowed thus to relieve their feelings. All that such cursing means is that one wishes one had never been born.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Job spake, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - And Job spake, and said, Let the day perish wherein I was born. An idle wish, doubtless; the vague utterance of extreme despair. Days cannot perish, or, at any rate, one day cannot perish more than another. They all come, and then are gone; but no day can perish out of the year, which will always have its full complement of three hundred and sixty-five days till time shall be no more. But extreme despair does not reason. It simply gives utterance to the thoughts and wishes as they arise. Job knew that many of his thoughts were vain and foolish, and confesses it further on (see Job 6:3). And the night in which it was said; rather, which said. Day and night are, both of them, personified, as in Psalm 19:2. There is a man child conceived. A man child was always regarded in the ancient world as a special blessing, since thus the family was maintained in being. A girl passed into another family.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Let that day be darkness; i.e. let a cloud rest upon it - let it be regarded as a day of ill omen, \"carbone notandus.\" Job recognizes that his wish, that the day should perish utterly, is vain, and limits himself now to the possible. Let not God regard it from above; i.e. let not God, from the heaven where he dwells, extend to it his protection and superintending care. Neither let the light shine upon it. Pleonastic, but having the sort of force which belongs to reiteration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Let darkness and the shadow of death. \"The shadow of death\" (צלמות) is a favourite expression in the Book of Job, where it occurs no fewer than nine times. Elsewhere it is rare, except in the Psalms, where it occurs four times. It is thought to be an archaic word. Stain it; rather, claim it, or claim it for their own (Revised Version). Let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. The hot, stifling \"blackness\" of the khamsin wind is probably meant, which suddenly turns the day into night, spreading all around a thick lurid darkness. When such a wind arises, we are told, \"The sky instantly becomes black and heavy; the sun loses its splendour, and appears of a dim violet hue; a light, warm breeze is felt, which gradually increases in heat till it almost equals that of an oven. Though no vapour darkens the air, it becomes so grey and thick with the floating clouds of impalpable sand, that it is sometimes necessary to use candles at noonday\" (Russell, 'Ancient and Modern Egypt,' p. 55).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - As for that night. The night, that is, of Job's conception (see above, ver. 3). Let darkness seize upon it. The Revised Version has thick darkness but this is unnecessary. Let it not be joined unto the days of the year. According to the Massorites' pointing, we should translate, \"Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;\" and so the Revised Version. But many of the best critics prefer the pointing which is followed by the LXX. and by King James's translators. The succeeding clause strongly supports this interpretation. Let it not come into the number of the months (comp. ver. 3, and the comment on it). Job wishes the day of his birth and the night of his conception to be utterly blotted out from the calendar; but, aware that this is impossible, he subsides into a milder class of imprecations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Lo, let that night be solitary; or, sterile; \"let no one be born in it.\" Lot no joyful voice come therein; literally, no song. Perhaps the moaning is, \"Let no such joyful announcement be made,\" as that mentioned in ver. 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Let them curse it that curse the day. Very different explanations are given of this passage. Some suppose it to mean, \"Let those desperate men curse it who are in the habit of cursing their day,\" like Job himself (Job 3:1) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 20:14). Others suggest a reference to such as claimed power to curse days, and to divide them into the lucky and the unlucky. In this case Job would mean, \"Let the sorcerers who curse days curse especially this day,\" and would thus seem, if not to sanction the practice, at any rate to express a certain amount of belief in the sorcerers' power. The second clause has also a double interpretation, which adapts it to either of these two suggested meanings (vide infra). Who are ready to raise up their mourning. This is an impossible rendering. Translate (with the Revised Version), who are ready to rouse up leviathan. \"Rousing leviathan\" may be understood in two ways. It may be regarded as spoken in the literal sense of those who are rash enough and desperate enough to stir up the fury of the crocodile (see the comment on Job 41:1), or in a metaphorical sense of such as stir up to action by their sorceries the great power of evil, symbolized in Oriental mythologies by a huge serpent, or dragon, or crocodile. On the whole, the second and deeper sense seems preferable; and we may conceive of Job as believing in the power of sorcery, and wishing it used against the night which he so much dislikes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; i.e. \"let not even the light of a star illuminate the morning or evening twilight of that night; let it be dark from beginning to end, uncheered even by the ray of a star.\" Let it look for light, but have none. Again a personification. The night is regarded as consciously waiting in hope of the appearance of morning, but continually disappointed by the long lingering of the darkness. And let it not see the dawning of the day; rather, as in the margin and in the Revised Version, let it not behold the eyelids of the morning (compare Milton's 'Lycidas,' \"Under the opening eyelids of the morn,\" and Soph., 'Antigone,' χρυσσέης ἁμέρας βλέφαρον).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb; literally, of my womb; i.e. \"of the womb which bare me.\" By a stretch of imagination, the night is supposed to have power to open or shut wombs, and is blamed for not having shut up the womb in which Job was conceived. Nor hid sorrow from mine eyes; i.e. \"and did not so prevent all the sorrows that have befallen me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Why died I not from the womb? \"From the womb\" must mean, \"as soon as I came out of the womb,\" not \"while I yet remained within it\" (comp. Jeremiah 20:17, \"Because he slew me not from the womb\"). Many of the ancients thought that it was best not to be born; and next best, if one were born, to quit the earth as soon as possible. Herodotus says that with the Trauri, a tribe of Thracians, it was the custom, whenever a child was born, for all its kindred to sit round it in a circle, and weep for the woes that it would have to endure now that it was come into the world; while, on the other hand, whenever a person died, they buried him with laughter and rejoicings, since they said that he was now free from a host of sufferings, and enjoyed the completest happiness (Herod., 5:4). Sophocles expresses the feeling with great terseness and force: Μὴ φῦναι τὸν ἅπαντα νικᾷ λόγον τὸ δ ἐπεὶ φαςῆ βῆναι κεῖθεν ὅθεν περ ἥκει πολὺ δεύτερον ὡστάχιστα (Ed. Col., 1225-1228): \"Not to be born is best of all; once born, next best it is by far to go back there from whence one came as speedily as possible.\" Modern pessimism sums up all in the phrase that \"life is not worth living.\" Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? As so often, the second clause of the distich repeats the idea of the first, merely varying the phraseology.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Why did the knees prevent me? i.e. \"Why did my mother take me on her knees and nurse me, instead of casting me on the ground, where I should have perished?\" There seems to be an allusion to the practice of parents only bringing up a certain number of their children (see Rosenmuller, 'Scholia in Vit. Test.,' vol. 5. p. 101). Or why the breasts that I should suck? i.e. \"Why were breasts offered to me, that I should suck them? How much better would it have been if I had been allowed to perish of inanition!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For now should I have lain still and been quiet. \"In that case, I should now (עתָּה) have been lying still and resting myself,\" instead of tossing about, and being full of restlessness and suffering.\" I should have slept. The life in the intermediate state is called \"sleep,\" even in the New Testament (Matthew 9:24; John 11:11; Acts 7:60; 1 Corinthians 15:18, 51, etc.). Job, perhaps, imagined it to be, actually, a sound, dreamless slumber. Then should I have been at rest; literally, then (אז) would there have been rest for me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - With kings and counsellers of the earth. As a great man himself, nobly born probably, Job expects that his place in another world would have been with kings and nobles (see Isaiah 14:9-11, where the King of Babylon, on entering Sheol, finds himself among \"all the kings of the nations\"). Which built desolate places for themselves. Some understand \"restorers of cities which had become waste and desolate;\" others, \"builders of edifices which, since they built them, have become desolate;\" others, again, \"builders of desolate and dreary piles,\" such as the Pyramids, and the rock-tombs common in Arabia, which were desolate and dreary from the time that they were built. The brevity studied by the writer makes his meaning somewhat obscure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver. This may either mean simply,\" princes who were rich in silver and gold during their lifetime,\" or \"princes who have gold and silver buried with them in their tombs.\" It was the custom in Egypt, in Phoenicia, and elsewhere throughout the East, to bury large quantities of treasure, especially gold and silver vessels, and jewellery, in the sepulchres of kings and other great men. A tomb of a Scythian king in the Crimea, opened about fifty years ago, contained a golden shield, a golden diadem, two silver vases, a vase in electrum, and a number of ornaments, partly in electrum and partly in gold (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 59, 3rd edit.). Another Scythian tomb near the Caspian, opened by the Russian authorities, contained ornaments set with rubies and emeralds, together with four sheets of gold, weighing forty pounds. A third, near Asterabad, contained a golden goblet, weighing seventy ounces; a pot, eleven ounces, and two small trumpets. The tombs of the kings and queens in Egypt were so richly supplied with treasure that, in the time of the twentieth dynasty, a thieves' society was formed for plundering them, especially of their golden ornaments (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 247, 1st edit.). The tomb of Cyrus the Great contained, we are told (Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 6:29), a golden couch, a golden table set out with drinking-cups, a golden bowl, and much elegant clothing adorned with gems. Phoenician tombs, in Cyprus especially, have recently yielded enormous treasures (Di Cesnola, 'Cyprus,' pp. 310-316). If the \"gold\" and \"silver\" of the present passage refer to treasures buried with princes and kings, we must understand by the \"houses\" of the second clause their tombs. The Egyptians called their tombs their \"eternal abodes\" (Diod. Sic., 1:51).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. This is added as another way in which Job might have escaped his misery. Though conceived and brought to the birth, he might have been still-born, and so have known no suffering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - There. The word has no expressed antecedent, but the general tenor of the passage supplies one. \"There\" is equivalent to \"in the grave.\" The wicked cease from troubling; i.e.\" cease from their state of continual perturbation and unrest\" (comp. Isaiah 57:20, \"But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt \"). This is their condition, so long as they live; nothing satisfies them; they are always in trouble themselves, and always causing trouble to others. In the grave alone do they rest, or seem to rest. And there the weary be at rest; literally, the weary in strength or \"in respect of strength;\" i.e. those whose strength is utterly exhausted and worn out. Here Job undoubtedly alludes to himself. He looks to the grave as his only refuge, the only hope he has of recovering peace and tranquillity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - There the prisoners rest together. \"There those who in life were prisoners, condemned to work at enforced labours, enjoy sweet rest together.\" They hear not the voice of the oppressor; rather, of the taskmaster (comp. Exodus 3:7; Exodus 5:6, where the same word is used). The task. master continually urged on the wearied labourers with such words as those of Exodus 5:13, \"Fulfil your works, fulfil your daily tasks. In the grave these hated sounds would not be heard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The small and great are there; i.e. \"all are there, the small and great alike;\" forNEWLINENEWLINE\"Omnes eodem cogimur, craniumNEWLINEVersatur urna serius ociusNEWLINESors exitura, et nos in aeternumNEWLINEExilium impositura cymbae.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Her., ' Od.')

Why, Job asks, is the miserable man forced to continue on the earth and see the light to-day? Why is he not sent down at once to the darkness of the grave? Surely this would have been better. Man often speaks as if he were wiser than his Maker, and could have much improved the system of the universe, if he had had the arranging of it; but he scarcely means what he says commonly. Such talk is, however, foolish, as is all captious questioning concerning the ways of God. The proper answer to all such questioning is well given by Zophar in Job 11:7, 8, \"Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell (Sheol); what canst thou know?\" And life unto the bitter in soul (see the comment on ver. 11, ad fin.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Which long for death, but it cometh not; literally, which wait for death' anxiously and longingly (comp. Psalm 33:20). And dig for it more than for hid treasures; i.e. \"seek it more earnestly than even they seek who dig for hid treasures.\" As Professor Lee remarks, \"From the great instability of all Eastern governments, treasures were in Eastern countries often hid away\" ('Book of Job,' pp. 200, 201). And hence treasure-seeking became a profession, which was pursued with avidity by a large number of persons. Even at the present day Orientals are so possessed with the idea, that they imagine every European, who is eager to unearth antiquities, must be seeking for buried treasure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Which rejoice exceedingly; literally, to exultation or \"to dancing;\" i.e. so that they almost dance with joy. And are glad, when they can find the grave. Job speaks as if he knew of such cases; and, no doubt, the fact of suicide proves that among men there are some who prefer to die rather than live. But suicides are seldom altogether in possession of their senses. Of sane men it may be doubted whether one in a thousand, however miserable, really wishes to die, or is \"glad when he can find the grave.\" In such thoughts as those to which Job here gives expression there is something morbid and unreal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Why is light given to a man whose way is hid? \"Obscured,\" that is, \"darkened,\" \"placed under a cloud\" (comp. ver. 20, where the sentiment is nearly the same). And whom God hath hedged in. Not in the way of protection, as in Job 1:10, but of obstruction and confinement: (comp. Job 19:8 and Hosea 2:6). Job feels himself confined, imprisoned, blocked in. He can neither see the path which he ought to pursue nor take steps in any direction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - For my sighing cometh before I eat literally, before my meat; i.e. \"more early and more constantly than my food\" (Professor Lee). And my roarings are poured out. The word translated \"roaring\" is used primarily of the roar of a lion (Zechariah 11:3; comp. Amos 3:8); secondarily, of the loud cries uttered by men who suffer pain (see Psalm 22:1; Psalm 32:4). (On the loud cries of Orientals when suffering from grief or pain, see the comment on Job 2:12.) Like the waters; i.e. freely and copiously, without let or stint. Perhaps the loud sound of rushing water is also alluded to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me; literally, for I fear a fear, and it comes upon me. The meaning is not that the affliction which has come upon him is a thing which Job had feared when he was prosperous; but that now that he is in adversity, he is beset with fears, and that all his presentiments of evil are almost immediately accomplished. The second clause, And that which I was (rather, am) afraid of is come unto me, merely repeats and emphasizes the first (see the comment on ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. Some Hebraists give quite a different turn to this passage, rendering it as follows: \"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble cometh\" (see the Revised Version, and compare Canon Cook's rendering in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 29, \"I have no peace, nor quiet, nor rest; but trouble cometh \"). Professor Lee, however, certainly one of the most eminent of modern Hebraists, maintains that the far more pregnant meaning of the Authorized Version gives the true sense. \"If I rightly apprehend,\" he says, \"the drift of the context here, Job means to have it understood that he is conscious of no instance in which he has relaxed from his religious obligations; of no season in which his fear and love of God have waxed weak; and, on this account, it was the more perplexing that such a complication of miseries had befallen him\" ('The Book of Job' pp. 201, 202); and he translates the passage (ibid., p. 121), \"I slackened not, neither was I quiet, neither took I rest; yet trouble came.\" Job's complaint is thus far more pointedly terminated than by a mere otiose statement that, \"without rest or pause, trouble came upon trouble.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.40":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the LORD answered Job, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - Between the first and the second part of the Divine discourse, at the end of which Job wholly humbles himself (Job 42:1-6), is interposed a short appeal on the part of the Almighty, and a short reply on Job's part, which, however, is insufficient. God calls upon Job to make good his charges (vers. 1, 2). Job declines, acknowledges himself to be of no account, and promises silence and submission for the future (vers. 3-5). But something more is needed; and therefore the discourse is further prolonged. Verses 1, 2. - Moreover the Lord. Jehovah' as in Job 38:1 and in the opening chapters (see the comment on Job 12:9). Answered Job, and said, Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? rather, Can he that reproveth contend with the Almighty? (see the Revised Version). Does Job, the reprover, think that he can really contend with the Almighty?

It would be absurd for one so weak and contemptible to attempt to argue with the Almighty. What shall I answer thee? or, What should I answer thee! What should I say, if I were to attempt a reply? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth (see the comment on Job 21:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?

The meaning is, \"I have already spoken, not once, but more than once. Now I will be silent; I will say no more.' There is a sort of recognition that the arguments used were futile, but not a full and complete confession, as in Job 42:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-24. - Job's confession not having been sufficiently ample, the Divine discourse is continued through the remainder of this chapter, and through the whole of the next, the object being to break down the last remnants of pride and self-trust in the soul of the patriarch, and to bring him to complete submission and dependence on the Divine will. The argument falls under three heads - Can Job cope with God in his general providence (vers? 6-14)? can he even cope with two of God's creatures - with behemoth or the hippopotamus (vers. 15-24); with leviathan, or the crocodile (Job 41:1-34)? Verse 6. - Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said (comp. Job 38:1). The storm still continued, or, after a lull, had returned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Gird up thy loins now like a man (see the comment on Job 38:3): I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. Job is given every opportunity of making good his pleas before God. If he has anything to say that he really wishes to urge, God is ready, nay, anxious, to hear him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Wilt thou also (rather, even) dis-annul my judgment? i.e. maintain that my judgment towards thee has not been just and equitable, and therefore, so far as it lies in thy power, disannul it? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? Dost thou think it necessary to accuse me of injustice, and condemn me. in order to establish thine own innocence? But there is no such necessity. The two things - my justice and thy innocence - are quite compatible. Only lay aside the notion that afflictions must be punitive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hast thou an arm like God? The might of God's arm is often dwelt upon in Scripture. He brought Israel out of Egypt ,' with a mighty hand and stretched-out arm\" (Deuteronomy 5:15; Deuteronomy 7:19, etc.). \"Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand,\" says one of the psalmists (Psalm 89:13). \"Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord!\" says Isaiah (Isaiah 51:9). No human strength, not the strength of all men put together, can compare with it. Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? (comp. Job 38:34, 35; and for the idea of thunder being the actual \"voice of God,\" see Job 37:4, 5; Psalm 68:33; Psalm 77:18, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. God is at all times \"clothed with majesty and strength\" (Psalm 93:1), \"with glory and beauty\" (Psalm 104:1). He \"decks himself with light as with a garment\" (Psalm 104:2). Job is challenged to array himself similarly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath. \"Give vent,\" i.e., \"to thy anger against the wicked, and let it be seen what thou canst do in the way of restraining evil and punishing transgressors.\" Behold every one that is proud, and abase him. If my moral government does not satisfy thee., Improve upon it. Put down those wicked ones whom thou sayest that I allow to prosper (Job 24:2-23); \"abase\" them in the dust; do what thou accusest me of not doing.

Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. The idea of ver. 11 is still further insisted on. Lot Job manifest himself as a power among men, if he cannot rival God in nature.

Then he may claim to be heard with respect to the moral government of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand and save thee. When he has done what he has been challenged to do in vers. 9-13, then Job may venture to contend with God. He will have established his own independence, and God will acknowledge him as an antagonist entitled to argue with him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-24. - This passage, together with the whole of ch. 41, has been regarded by some critics as an interpolation. Its omission would certainly not affect the argument; and it is thought, in some respects, to contain traces of a later age than that which most commentators assign to the remainder of the book, or, at any rate, to the greater portion of it. The recurrence to the animal creation, when the subject seemed to have been completed (Job 39:30), is also a difficulty. But, on the other hand, as there is no variation, either in the manuscripts or in the versions, and no marked difference either of style or tone of thought between the rest of the book and this controverted passage, it is best regarded as an integral portion of the work, proceeding from the same author, although perhaps at a later period. No one denies that the style is that of the best Hebrew poetry, or that the book would be weakened by the excision of the passage. \"Le style,\" says M. Renan, \"est celui des meilleurs endroits du poeme. Nulle part la coupe n'est pins vigoreuse, le parallelisme plus sonore.' Verse 15. - Behold now behemoth. \"Behemoth\" is ordinarily the plural of behemah \"a beast;\" but it is scarcely possible to understand the word in this sense in the present passage, where it seems to be a noun singular, being followed by singular verbs, and represented by singular pronouns. Hence modern critics almost unanimously regard the word here as designating \"some particular animal.\" The mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the elephant have been suggested. Of these the mammoth is precluded by the want of any evidence that it existed in Job's day, and the rhinoceros by the absence of any allusion to its peculiar feature. Authorities are divided almost equally between the elephant and the hippopotamus; but the best recent Hebraists and naturalists incline rather to the latter. Which I made with thee; i.e. \"which I created at the same time as I created thee\" (Genesis 1:24-26). He eateth grass as an ox; i.e. he is graminivorous, not carnivorous. This is admitted to be true of the hippopotamus, which lives in the Nile during the day, and at night emerges from the river, and devastates the crops of sugar-cane, rice, and millet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Lo now, his strength is in his loins. The strength of the hippopotamus is its principal characteristic. Weighing often two thousand kilogrammes, and of a short thick make, when roused to anger it has a force which is irresistible. In the water it upsets large beats; on land it forces its way through dense thickets and fences of all kinds. The loins are especially strong, being deep, broad, and immensely muscular. And his force is in the navel of his belly; rather, in the muscles of his bell'i. The word used (שׁרידים) occurs only in this place. It is a plural form, and therefore cannot designate a single object, like the navel. The root seems to be the Syriac serir \"firm,\" whence Schultens proposes to translate שׁרירים by firmitates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He moveth his tail like a cedar. The tail of the hippopotamus is remarkably short and thick. It only bends slightly, being stiff and unyielding, like the stem of a cedar. The sinews of his stones (rather, of his thighs) are wrapped together; or, interwoven one with another (so Professor Lee and Mr. Houghton).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - His bones are as strong pieces of brass; rather, as tubes of bronze. The great thigh-bones - μηρία of the Greeks - are probably intended. These are hollow, being filled with marrow, and are so strong that they may be well compared to \"tubes of bronze.\" (On the identity of nekhushah or nekhosheth with \"bronze\" rather than \"brass,\" see the article on \"Brass,\" in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 225.) His bones (rather, his ribs) are like bars of iron. Either the ribs, or the solid bones of the lower leg, forearm, etc., are intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He is the chief of the ways of God. This is the main argument in favour of the elephant, rather than the hippopotamus, being intended (see Schultens, ad loc.). It has, indeed, been argued that some specimens of the hippopotamus exceed the elephant in height and bulk (Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 19); but no modern naturalist certainly would place the former animal above the latter in any catalogue raisonee of animals arranged according to their size and importance. The elephant, however, may not have been known to the author of Job, or, at any rate, the Asiatic species, which seems not to have been imported into Assyria before the middle of the ninth century B.C. In this case, the hippopotamus might well seem to him the grandest of the works of God. He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. This is explained to mean, \"Only God can attack behemoth with success and slay him; man is powerless to do so\" (Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). But the Egyptians, from very early times, used to attack the hippopotamus and slay him (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2, p. 100). It is better, therefore, to translate the passage, with Schultens, \"He that made him hath furnished him with his sword,\" and to understand by \"his sword\" those sharp teeth with which the hippopotamus is said to \"cut the grass as neatly as if it were mown and to sever, as if with shears a tolerably stout and thick stem\" (Wood, ' Natural History,' vol. 1. p. 762). Compare the 'Theriaca' of Nicander, 11. 566, 567 -NEWLINENEWLINEΗ ἵππου τὸν Νεῖλος ὑπὲρ Σάι'ν αἰθαλόεσσανNEWLINEΒόσκει ἀρούρησιν δὲ κακὴν ἐπιβάλλεται ἅρπηνNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Surely the mountains bring him forth food. Neither the hippopotamus nor the elephant is an inhabitant of \"mountains,\" according to our use of the word. But the harim (הָרִים) of the original is used of very moderate eminences. In the highly poetical language of Job, and especially of this passage, the term may well be applied to the hills on either side of the Nile, which approach closely to the river, and to this day furnish the hippopotamus with a portion of its food (see Hasselquist, ' Travels,' p. 188). Where all the beasts of the field play. By \"the beasts of the field\" seem to be meant the cattle and other do-mastic animals which are not driven from their pasture-grounds by the \"river-horse\" (Tristram, 'Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 52).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He listh under the shady trees; or, under the lotus trees (Revised Version). The Lotus sylvestris or Lotus Cyrenaiea \"grows abundantly an the hot banks of the Upper Nile\" (Cook). and is thought to be the tree here intended (Schultens. Cook, Houghton, and others). But the identification is very doubtful. The dense shade of trees is sought alike by the hippopotamus and the elephant. In the covert of the reed, and fens. This is exactly descriptive of the hippopotamus; far less so of the elephant. Gordon Cumming says, \"At every turn there occurred deep still pools, and occasional sandy islands, densely clad with lofty reeds Above and beyond these reeds stood trees of immense age. beneath which grew a rank kind of grass, on which the sea-cow (hippopotamus) delights to pasture\" ('Lion-Hunter of South Africa,' p. 297).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The shady trees (or, the lotus trees) cover him with their shadow (see the comment on ver. 21); the willows of the brook compass him round about. The \"willow of the brook\" (Leviticus 23:40) is probably the Saliz Aegyptiaca or safsaf which grows plentifully in the Nile valley, fringing the course both of the Nile itself and of the many streams derived from it. The Saliz Babylonica or \"weeping willow,\" is less likely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not; rather, behold let a river overflow he trembleth not (ἐὰν πλημμύρα γεηται, οὐ μὴ αἰσθηθῇ LXX). As an amphibious animal, the overflowing of a river has no terrors for the hippopotamus. But it would have some terrors for an elephant. He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. It is better to translate, he is steadfast (or, confident)' though Jordan swell even to his mouth. \"Jordan\" probably stands for any large and strong-flowing river. The conjecture that ירדן is a corruption of יר, which often stands for \"the Nile,\" is ingenious, but unnecessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob40:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He taketh it with his eyes; rather, Shall one take him when he is looking on? \"Can he be captured.\" i.e. \"when his eyes are open, and when he sees what is intended? No. If captured at all, it must be by subtlety, when he is not on the watch.\" His nose pierceth through snares; rather, Or can one bore his nostril with cords? i.e. can we lead him away captive, with a ring or hook passed through his nose, and a cord attached (compare the next chapter, ver. 2)?NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.41":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-34. - The crowning description of a natural marvel - the \"leviathan,\" or crocodile - is now given, and with an elaboration to which there is no parallel in the rest of Scripture. It forms, however, a fit climax to the gradually more and more elaborate descriptions of Job 38:39-41; Job 39:1-30; and Job 40:15-24. Verse 1. - Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? The word leviathan, or more properly livyathan, which has previously occurred in ch. 3:8, and is found also in Psalm 74:14; Psalm 104:26; and Isaiah 27:1, seems to be derived from לוי, \"twisting,\" and תן, \"a monster,\" whence the תּנּין or תּנּים of the Pentateuch and also of Job (Job 7:12), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 9:11), and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 29:3). It is thus a descriptive epithet rather than a name, and has not unnaturally been used to designate more than one kind of animal. The best modern critics regard it as applied sometimes to a python or large serpent, sometimes to a cetacean, a whale or grampus, and sometimes, as hero, to the crocodile. This last application is now almost universally accepted. The crocodile was fished for by the Egyptians with a hook, and in the time of Herodotus was frequently caught and killed (Herod., 2:70); but probably in Job's day no one had been so venturous as to attack him. Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? rather, or press down his tongue with a cord? (see the Revised Version); i.e. \"tie a rope round his lower jaw, and so press down his tongue.\" Many savage animals are represented in the Assyrian sculptures as led along by a rope attached to their mouths.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Canst thou put an hook into his nose? rather, a reed, or a rope of reeds. The exact meaning is doubtful. Or bore his jaw through with a thorn? A hook or ring is meant, rather than a \"thorn\" - such a \"hook\" or \"ring\" as was commonly used for keeping fish captive in the water, or for bringing prisoners of rank into the presence of the monarchs who had captured them (see 2 Kings 19:28; 2 Chronicles 33:11; Amos 4:2; 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 304,367).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?

As captive monarchs do. Wilt thou take him as a servant for ever? (comp. Exodus 21:6; Deuteronomy 15:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? The Egyptians were especially fond of pet animals, and Job's countrymen, it may be assumed, were the same. Besides dogs, we find the Egyptians keeping tame antelopes, leopards, and monkeys. A tame crocodile would certainly seem to be an extraordinary pet, but Herodotus says that the Egyptians tamed them (2:39), and Sir Gardner Wilkinson informed me that he had known some tame ones at Cairo. The Mesopotamian Arabs domesticate falcons to assist them in the chase of the bustard and the gazelle (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 481-483). And this usage, though not represented on the Assyrian monuments, is likely to have been ancient. Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? i.e. Wilt thou so secure him that he may be delivered over to thy handmaidens, to be made their pet and playfellow?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Shall the companions make a banquet of him? rather. Shall the companions make a traffic of him? By \"the companions\" we may understand either the guilds or companies of fishermen, which might be regarded as engaged in making the capture, or the travelling bands of merchants, who might be supposed willing to purchase him and carry him away. As no one of these last could be imagined rich enough to make the purchase alone, a further question is asked, Shall they part him among the merchants? i.e. allow a number to club together, each taking a share.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? The hippopotamus was captured in this way by the Egyptians at an early date, and hence the idea of trying the same mode of capture with the crocodile would naturally arise; but in the time of Job it would seem that no one had been bold enough to attempt it. The skin of the crocodile is penetrable in very few places, and his capture by a single man with a harpoon, though now sometimes practised (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 99), is still a work of danger and difficulty. Or his head with fish-spears? Fish-spears would have small effect on the head of a crocodile, which is bony and covered by a very tough skin. There is a vulnerable place, however, at the point where the head joins the spine, at which the ancient Egyptians, when they ventured to attack the crocodile, were wont to strike (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 545).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8 - Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. This is again ironical, like vers. 3-6. \"Only just put forth thy hand against him - bethink thee of war - do it once and no more.\" (comp. Rosenmuller, 'Scholia in Jobum,' p. 976). The idea is that once will be enough. A man will not live to do it a second time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Behold, the hope of him is in vain; i.e. the hope of capturing or killing him. Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? The very sight of the savage and invulnerable animal is enough to make a man fall to the ground with fear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - None is so fierce that dare stir him up. The crocodile is often seen asleep, or nearly asleep, upon sand-banks washed by the Nile. He would be a bold man who should creep near, and stir him up. Who then is able to stand before me? Here we reach the point whereto the whole argument has been working up. If man cannot cope with creatures, which are the work of God's hands, how much leas can he presume to cope with him who is their Maker!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? i.e. \"Who hath laid me under any obligation, so that I should be bound to fall in with his views, and take such a course as he might prescribe?\" The allusion is to Job's persistent demand for a hearing - a controversy (Job 9:34, 35; Job 10:3; Job 13:3, 22; Job 23:3-7, etc.) - a trial, in which he shall plead with God, and God with him, upon even terms as it were, and so the truth concerning him, his sins, his integrity, his sufferings, and their cause or causes, shall be made manifest. God resists any and every claim that is made on him to justify himself and his doings to a creature. He is not a debtor to any. If he explains himself to any extent, if he condescends to give an account of any of his doings, it is of pure grace and favour. It has been observed that we might have expected this to be the conclusion of the entire discourse begun in ch. 38; and that no doubt would have been, according to ordinary laws of human composition, its more proper place. But Hebrew poetry is erratic, and pays little regard to logical lawn If anything important has been omitted in its more proper place, it is inserted in one which is, humanly speaking, less proper. The details concerning the crocodile, which are calculated to deepen the general impression, having been passed over where we might have expected them, are here subjoined, as filling out the description of vers. 1-10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. The further description is introduced by this formal announcement, which is perhaps best rendered, I will not keep silence concerning his limbs nor concerning the matter of his might or the comeliness of his proportion (see the Revised Version); i.e. I will enter upon these points seriatim and set them forth severally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Who can discover the face of his garment? Some critics understand this in a general sense, \"Who can lay him open to assault?\" Others suggest a more definite meaning,\" Who can strip off his outer covering?\" the scaly coat, that is, which forms his special defence, and expose the comparatively tender skin below? If this were done, he would then be at the hunter's mercy; but who will undertake to do it? Who, again, can come to him with his double bridle? Come, i.e., with a double bridle in his hand, and place it in the monster's jaws. (So Schultens and Professor Lee.) Others translate, \"Who will come within [the range of] his double bridle? and understand by \"his double bridle\" his two rows of teeth - Homer's ἑρκος ὀδόντων (Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, Professor Stanley Leathes, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Who can open the doors of his face? Who can make him open his huge, gaping jaws, if he chooses to keep them shut? Who would dare to do so? His teeth are terrible round about. The crocodile has \"two rows of sharply pointed teeth, thirty or more on each side\" (Russell's 'Ancient and Modern Egypt,' p. 460). They are \"so formed and disposed as to tear their prey rather than masticate it\" ('Dict. Universelle des Sciences,' p. 447). The voracity of the full-grown crocodile is great; and he will not scruple to attack and devour men, if they come in his way. The natives of Upper Egypt have a wholesome terror of him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - His scales are his pride; or, his pride is in the channeling of his scales (literally, of his shields). The scales of the crocodile are arranged in five rows along his entire back, with a depression between the rows which is like a \"channel.\" Each individual scale resembles a shield. They are shut up together as with a close seal; each, i.e. closely attached to its fellow,so that there is no space between them. \"A rifle-ball,\" according to Canon Tristram, \"glances off from them as from a rock\" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 352).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne is so near to another, that no air can come between them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - One is so near to another, that no air can come between them (see the comment on the preceding verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered; literally, they are soldered one to another (comp. Isaiah 41:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - By his neesings a light doth shine. \"Neesings\" is old English for \"sneezings.\" According to Aristotle, the crocodile is in the habit of sneezing, but I do not find this fact noted by modern writers Boehart asserts it very positively ('Hieroz.,' pp. 752-754), but he does not profess to speak from his own knowledge. And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. This probably does not mean more than that his eyes flash with light upon occasion, which is no doubt true, though the eyes, being small, have not generally attracted very much attention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. The description now becomes highly poetical, and it would be a mistake to endeavour to substantiate it. The intention is to represent the impression which the animal would make on an impressible but unscientific observer viewing it in its native haunts for the first time. Splashing, snorting, and throwing up spray all around, it would seem to be breathing out steam and smoke, from which the idea of fire is inseparable (see the next verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron; rather, as from a seething pot and rushes; i.e. as from a pot heated by burning rushes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. All the representations of dragons breathing smoke and flames, found in the myths and sagas of so many countries, probably rest upon the observed fact of team or spray streaming forth from the mouth and widely opened nostrils of the crocodile. The steam has seemed to be smoke, and smoke has naturally suggested flame and fire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In his neck remaineth strength. It has been well remarked that the whale has no neck, or at any rate none {hat is visible, while the crocodile has one that is of great strength, and that naturally attracts observation. \"Le cou assez marque,\" says the 'Dictionnaire des Sciences' (l.s.c.). It is nearly of the same diameter with the head at the point of junction, and where it adjoins the body is still larger. And sorrow is turned into joy before him; rather, and terror rid'seth before him (see the Revised Version). Whithersoever he proceeds, he causes terror; people tremble, take to flight, and disappear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The flakes of his flesh are joined together. Even the softer muscles, and parts which in most animals are yielding and flabby, in the crocodile are bound up, and, as it were, soldered together (scrap. ver. 17). They are firm in themselves; rather, they are firm upon him; literally, fused upon him, like detached pieces of metal, which are melted one into another. They cannot be moved. His whole body is so firmly compacted together that it is all one piece; the separate parts cannot be moved separately. One result is that the crocodile has great difficulty in turning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - His heart is firm as a stone. Some regard this as intended physically, and note that the great saurians, with their cold and sluggish circulation, have hearts which are comparatively torpid, not contracting or expanding readily. Others take the \"stony heart\" to mean a fierce and obstinate disposition. In either case, the description will well suit the crocodile. Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. A repetition and slight exaggeration of the preceding idea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid. Egyptian historians said that one of their early kings had been slain by a crocodile (Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 1:20, p. 98). The worship paid to crocodiles in some parts of Egypt, and the hatred felt towards them in others, were probably alike inspired by fear. AElian says that, in the districts where crocodiles were worshipped, it was not safe for any one to wash his feet or to draw water at the river, and that in the vicinity of some towns people did not dare to walk along the bank of the stream ('Nat. An.,' 10:24). In modern times they have been known to precipitate men from the bank into the water by a sweep of their tail, and then to devour them at their leisure. By reason of breakings they purify themselves; rather, they are confounded. The \"breakings\" may by either the breakings forth of the animal from his lair among the Nile rushes, or his \"breaking\" of the weapons of his assailants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold. It either makes no impression or it snaps in his hand. Equally vain are the spear, the dart, and the javelin. Habergeon is a mistranslation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass (rather, bronze) as rotten wood. Even the hardest metals are useless against the crocodile. Moderns observe that even firearms are of little avail against him. The back and tail, at any rate, resist musket-balls (Bochart); and a rifle-bullet will glance aside if it strikes one of the scales (Tristram); see ver. 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The arrow cannot make him flee; literally, the son of the bow (comp. Lamentations 3:13, where arrows are called \"sons of the quiver\"). Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble. (On the use of the sling as a weapon of war in early times, see the author's . 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 449; and comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, pp. 35, 36; 1 Samuel 17:49, 50; 2 Kings 3:25.) (On \"stubble\" as a metaphor for weakness, see above, Job 21:18, and compare the next verse.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDarts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Darts are counted as stubble; rather, the club is counted as stubble. Maces, either of hard wood or of metal, were used by the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 64). They had heavy heads, and were quite as effective weapons as either swords or spears. If a strong man could have succeeded in dealing a blow with one on the head of a crocodile, it would probably have proved fatal; but intending assailants were doubtless charged, and scattered \"as stubble,\" before they could find opportunity to strike. He laugheth at the shaking of a spear; rather, at the rushing of the javelin (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Sharp stones are under him; rather, jagged potsherds are under him; i.e. \"his belly is covered with jagged scales\" - a thing which is true of the crocodile, but scarcely of any other beast. He spreadeth sharp pointed things (rather, a threshing-wain, or a corn-drag) upon the mire. He leaves on the mud on which he has lain, i.e. an impression as of an Oriental threshing-wain, or corn-drag, which is \"a thick plank of timber, stuck full on the under side, of flints or hard cutting stones arranged in the form of the palate or rough tongue of a cow\" (Sir C. Fellows, 'Asia Minor,' p. 70). The mud-banks on which crocodiles have been lying are said to be scored all over with such impressions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - He maketh the deep to boil like a pot. The rush of the crocodile through the water of the stream or pool in which he dwells causes a stir and a commotion which is forcibly compared to the boiling of water in a caldron. He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. It is generally allowed that by \"the sea\" here is meant the Nile, as in Isaiah 18:2; Isaiah 19:5; and Nahum 3:8. The swirl of the Nile, as the crocodile makes his rush, is like the heaving of a pot of boiling oil or ointmentNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. He leaves a white trail behind him as he passes from sand-bank to sand-bank through the shallows. It is as if the Nile had grown old and put on hoar hairs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear (comp. vers. 24-29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob41:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He beholdeth all high things He looks without fear on everything that is high and great. Nothing alarms him; nothing disturbs his equanimity. He is a king over all the children (literally, sons) of pride (comp. Job 28:8). He feels himself superior to all other animals that come within his ken. They may be \"sons of pride,\" but he has more to be proud of than the proudest of them. Ordinarily, the lion poses as \"the king of beasts;\" but here he is, as it were, deposed, and relegated into the second position (Job 38:39), the crocodile being exalted into his place. From different points of view, there are several great beasts which might be regarded as the lords of the animal creation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.42":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Job answered the LORD, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-17. - This concluding chapter divides into two parts. In the first part (vers. 1-6) Job makes his final submission, humbling himself in the dust before God. In the second (vers. 7-17) the historical framework, in which the general dialogue is set, is resumed and brought to a close. God's approval of Job is declared, and his anger denounced against the three friends, who are required to expiate their guilt by a sacrifice, and only promised forgiveness if Job will intercede on their behalf (ver. 8). The sacrifice takes place (ver. 9); and then a brief account is appended of Job's after life - his prosperity, his reconciliation with his family and friends, his wealth, his sons and daughters, and his death in a good old age, when he was \"full of days\" (vers. 10-17.). The poetic structure, begun in Job 3:3, is continued to the end of ver. 6, when the style changes into prose of the same character as that employed in ch.. 1. 2, and in Job 32:1-5. Verses 1, 2. - Then Job answered the Lord, and said, I know that thou caner do every thing; i.e. I know and acknowledge thy omnipotence, which thou hast set forth so magnificently before me in ch. 38-41. It is brought home to me by the grand review of thy works which thou hast made, and the details into which thou hast condescended to enter. I know also and acknowledge that no thought can be with-holden from thee; i.e. I confess also thy omniscience - that thou knowest even the thoughts of all created beings (comp. Psalm 44:21; Psalm 139:2; Hebrews 4:13, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? As these are nearly the words of God in Job 38:2, some suppose that they must be his words again here, and imagine a short dialogue in this place between Job and the Almighty, assigning to Job ver. 2, the latter half of ver. 8, and the whole of vers. 5 and 6, while they assign to God ver. 4 and the first clause of ver. 8. But it is far more natural to regard Job as bringing up the words which God had spoken to him, to ponder on them and answer them, or at any rate to hang his reply upon them, than to imagine God twice interrupting Job in the humble confession that he was anxious to make. We must understand, then, after the word \"knowledge,\" an ellipse of \"thou sayest.\" Therefore have I uttered that I understood not. Therefore, because of that reproof of thine, I perceive that, in what I said to my friends, I \"darkened counsel,\" - I \"uttered that I understood not,\" words which did not clear the matter in controversy, but obscured it. I dealt, in fact, with things too wonderful for me - beyond my compre-hension - which I knew not, of which I had no real knowledge, but only a semblance of knowledge, and on which, therefore, I had better have been silent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me, Job refers to God's words in Job 38:3 and Job 40:7, and realizes the humbling effect which they had had on him. They made him feel how little he knew on the subject of God's works and ways, and how little competent he was to judge them. Hence he bursts into the confession-NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear. Hitherto, i.e., I have had nothing but hearsay knowledge of thee; I have not known thee in any true sense; but now - now that thou hast revealed thy-self - mine eye seeth thee; my spiritual eye is opened, and I begin to see thee in thy true might, thy true greatness, thy true inscrutableness. Now I recognize the distance which separates us, and feel how unreasonable it is that I should contend with thee, argue with thee, assume myself to be competent to pass judgment on thy doings. \"Wherefore I abhor myself,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Wherefore I abhor myself; or, I loathe my words (see the Revised Version). And repent in dust and ashes. Job was still sitting on the ash-heap on which he had thrown himself when his disease first smote him (Job 2:8). He had thrown himself on it in grief and de, pair; he will remain seated on it in compunction and penitence. His self-humiliation is now complete. He does not retract what he has said concerning his essential integrity, but he admits that his words have been overbold, and his attitude towards God one unbefitting a creature. God accepts his submission, and proceeds to vindicate him to his \"friends,\" and to visit them with condemnation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job. The \"words\" intended seem to be those of ch. 38-41, not any words in the earlier portion of this chapter. God heard Job's confession in silence, and, without further speech to him, addressed Eliphaz and his \"friends.\" The Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends. The superior position of Eliphaz is here very strongly recognized - he alone is mentioned by name, he alone addressed directly. The precedence thus given to him accords with that which he holds, both in the earlier historical narrative (Job 2:11) and in the dialogue (Job 4:1; Job 15:1; Job 22:1). For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. Job had, on the whole, spoken what was right and true of God, and is acknowledged by God as his true servant. The \"comforters,\" consciously or unconsciously, had spoken what was false. Even if they said what they believed, they ought to have known better.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams. (On the early and widespread prevalence of the rite of sacrifice,-see the comment upon Job 1:5.) (On the preference, for sacrificial purposes, of the number seven, see Leviticus 23:18; Numbers 23:1, 14, 29; Numbers 28:11, 19, 27; Numbers 29:2, 8, 36; 1 Chronicles 15:26 . 2 Chronicles 29:21; Ezra 8:35; Ezekiel 45:23, etc.) It is noticeable that \"seven bullocks and seven rams\" was exactly the offering of the Moabite king Balak, and his prophet Balaam, contemporary with Moses. And go to my servant Job. Humble yourselves before the man whom you have striven to abase and bring low. Go to him - make application to him, that he will be pleased to come to your aid, joining and assisting in the offering which I require at your hands. And offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. Do as Job had done for his sins (Job 1:5), \"offer a burnt offering;\" and then my servant Job shall pray for you. Present at your sacrifice, and sharing in it, he shall assume the highest priestly function, and intercede on your behalf. For him will I accept; literally, his face, or his person, will I accept. It is implied that, apart from Job, the three \"comforters\" would not have been listened to, much less have obtained pardon. Lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job (see the comment on the preceding verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord commanded them; i.e. \"went\" to Job, and asked his aid and interposition, and obtained it. The Lord also accepted Job; i.e. looked favourably on Job's intercession, and for his sake pardoned those for whom he made his prayer. Job is thus a type of Christ, not merely in his sufferings, but also in his mediatorial character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10 - And the Lord turned the captivity of Job. The literal use of this phrase is common, the metaphorical use of it uncommon, in Scripture. Still, it is so simple a metaphor, and captivity so common a thing among ancient peoples, that it may well have been in general use among the nations of Western Asia from very primitive times. It signifies, as Professor Lee remarks, \"a restoration to former happy circumstances.\" When he prayed for his friends. Perhaps his complete forgiveness by God was contingent on his own complete forgiveness of his \"friends\" (Matthew 6:12, 14, 15; Matthew 18:32-35); at any rate, his restoration immediately followed his intercession. Also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before; literally, added to all that had been Job's to the double (comp. ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Then came there unto him all his brethren. Job's \"brethren,\" and his desertion by them in his misfortunes, had been mentioned in Job 19:13. Now these fair-weather friends flocked to him again, and professed affection and interest, ignoring probably, or excusing, their long absence and neglect. And all his sisters. One sex had behaved no better to him than the other. His nearest female relatives had failed to show themselves the \"ministering angels\" that they are commonly accounted, even when \"pain and anguish\" most \"wrung his brow.\" And all they that had been of his acquaintance before. Job, like other wealthy and prosperous men had during the time of his prosperity had \"troops of friends\" (see Job 29:8-10, 21-25). When adversity swooped down they fell away. Now they had the effrontery to claim his acquaintance once more, and to come and be his guests; they did eat bread with him in his house. Nay, more, they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him, whereof the worst part was their own coldness and desertion (Job 19:13, 14, 19). Finally, to establish the renewed friendship, every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold. The money given is said to have been a kesitah which means probably a certain weight of silver, though whether a shekel or not is uncertain. The word belongs to the earlier Hebrew, being found only in Genesis 33:19; Joshua 24:32, and in the present passage. Ear-rings were commonly worn in the East by men as well as women, as appears from the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian sculptures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning (comp. above, ver. 10). The restoration of prosperity, prophesied by Eliphaz (Job 5:18 26), Bildad (Job 8:20, 21), and Zophar (Job 11:13-19), but not expected by Job, came, not in consequence of any universal law, but by the will of God, and his pure grace and favour. It in no way pledged God to compensate worldly adversity by worldly prosperity in the case of any other sufferer; and certainly the general law seems to be that such earthly compensation is withheld. But, in combination with the instinct which demands that retributive justice shall prevail universally, it may be taken as an earnest of God's ultimate dealings with men, and a sure indication that, if not on earth, at least in the future state; each man shall receive \"the deeds done in the body,\" according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil. For he had (rather, and he had) fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. In every case the exact double of his original possessions (see Job 1:3; and comp. above, ver. 12). We need not suppose, however, that either the round numbers, or the exact duplicity, are historical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe had also seven sons and three daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He had also seven sons and three daughters. The same number as previously (Job 1:2), neither more nor fewer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And he called the name of the first, Jemima. The name \"Jemima\" is probably derived from yom (יום), \"day,\" and means \"Fair as the day.\" And the name of the second, Kesia. \"Kezia\" (rather, \"Keziah\") was the Hebrew name of the spice which the Greeks and Romans called \"cassia,\" a spice closely allied to cinnamon, and much esteemed in the East (see Herod., 3:110). And the name of the third, Keren-happuch; literally, horn of stibium - stibium being the dye (antimony) with which Oriental women have from a remote antiquity been in the habit of anointing the upper and lower eyelids in order to give lustre to the eye (compare the 'Pulpit Commentary' on the 'Second Book of Kings,' p. 194). The three names, according to Oriental notions, implied either sweetness or beauty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job. Beauty has always been highly valued in the East; and Job would feel himself highly favoured in having three beautiful daughters. It may have been on account of their great beauty that their father gave them inheritance among their brethren, which was certainly an unusual practice in the East.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - After this lived Job an hundred and forty years. It has been concluded from this statement, combined with that at the close of ver. 10, that Job was exactly seventy years of age when his calamities fell upon him ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 1087, note); but this is really only a conjecture, since the statement that \"God added to all that had been Job's to the double,\" does not naturally apply to anything but his property. We may, however, fairly allow that (as Professor Lee says) he \"could scarcely have been less than seventy\" when his afflictions came, having then a family of ten children, who were all grown up (Job 1:4). In this case, the whole duration of his life would have been 210 years, or a little more, which cannot be regarded as incredible by those who accept the ages of the patriarchs, from Peleg to Jacob, as respectively 239, 230, 148, 205, 175, 180, and 147 years. And saw his sons, and his sons' sons; i.e. his descendants - grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Even four gone-rations. According to the Hebrew inclusive practice of reckoning, we may regard his own generation as included.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob42:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Job died, being old and full of days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - So Job died, being old and full of days. The lowest estimate places the occurrence of the afflictions of Job at the time when he was a little more than fifty (\"Supponitur quinquagenario hand multo majorem fuisse Nostrum, quum conflictari coepit,\" Schultens). Thus his age at his death would be at least a hundred and ninety,NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said (see the comment on Job 2:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? rather, If one assay a word against thee wilt thou be angry? Eliphaz feels that what he is about to say will be unwelcome, and, as it were, apologizes beforehand. Surely Job will not be angry if a friend just ventures a word. But who can withhold himself from speaking? Let Job be angry or not, Eliphaz must speak. It is impossible to hear such words as Job has uttered, and yet keep silence. God's wisdom and justice have been impugned, and must be vindicated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Behold, thou hast instructed many; or, corrected many. When others have been afflicted and murmured, thou hast corrected them, and shown them that they were suffering only what they deserved to suffer. In so doing, thou hast strengthened the weak hands; \"given moral strength,\" i.e., \"to those who were morally weak,\" upheld them, saved them from impatient words and hard thoughts of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thy words have upholden him that was falling. Many a man, just on the point of falling, has been stopped in time by thy wise words and good advice to him. This is a strong testimony to Job's kindliness of heart, and active sympathy with sufferers during the period of his prosperity. And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees; literally, the bowing knees - those that were just on the point of collapsing and giving way through exhaustion or feebleness (comp. Isaiah 35:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest. Now it is thy turn - calamity has come upon thee and all that thou weft wont to say to others is forgotten. The wise physician cannot heal himself. Instead of receiving thy chastisement in a right spirit, thou \"faintest,\" or rather, \"thou art angry, art offended\" - as the same verb is also to be translated in the second verse. There is a tone of sarcasm about these remarks, which implies a certain hardness and want of real affection in the speaker, and which cannot but have been perceived by Job, and have detracted from the force of what Eliphaz urged. If one has to rebuke a friend, it should be done with great delicacy. Our \"precious balms\" should not be allowed to \"break his head\" (Psalm 141:6). It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled; or, perplexed - \"confounded.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? Translate, with the Revised Version, Is not thy fear of God thy confidence and thy hope the integrity of thy ways? The verse is composed, as usual, of two clauses, balancing each other; and the meaning seems to be that, if Job is as convinced of his piety and uprightness as he professes to be, he ought still to maintain confidence in God, and a full expectation of deliverance from his troubles. If he does not, what is the natural inference? Surely, that he is not so confident of his innocence as he professes to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? The heart of the matter is now approached. Job is called upon to \"remember\" the long-established moral axiom, that only evil-doing brings down upon men calamities, and that therefore, where calamities fall, them must be precedent wickedness. If he does not admit this, he-is challenged to bring forward examples, or even a single example, of suffering innocence. If he does admit it, he is left to apply the axiom to himself. Or where were the righteous cut off? Was the example of \"righteous Abel\" (Matthew 23:35) unknown to Eliphaz? And had he really never seen that noblest of all sights, the good man struggling with adversity? One would imagine it impossible to attain old age, in the world wherein we live, without becoming convinced by our own observation that good and evil, prosperity and adversity, are not distributed in this life according to moral desert; but a preconceived notion of what ought to have been seems here, as elsewhere so often in the field of speculation, to have blinded men to the actual facts of the case, and driven them to invent explanations of the facts, which militated against their theories, of the most absurdly artificial character. To account for the sufferings of the righteous, the explanation of \"secret sins\" was introduced, and it was argued that, where affliction seemed to fall on the good man, his goodness was not real goodness - it was a counterfeit, a sham - the fabric of moral excellence, so fair to view, was honeycombed by secret vices, to which the seemingly good man was a prey. Of course, if the afflictions wore abnormal, extraordinary, then the secret sins must be of a most heinous and horrible kind to deserve such a terrible retribution. This is what Eliphaz hints to be the solution in Job's case. God has seen his secret sins - he has \"set them in the light of his countenance\" (Psalm 90:8) - and is punishing them openly. Job's duty is to humble himself before God, to confess, repent, and amend. Then, and then only, may he hope that God will remove his hand, and put an end to his sufferingsNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Even as I have seen; rather, according as I have seen - so far, that is, as my observation goes (see the Revised Version, which is supported by Professor Lee and Canon Cook). They that plough iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same (comp. Proverbs 22:8; Hosea 8:7; Hosea 10:13; Galatians 6:7, 8). The words translated \"iniquity\" and \"wickedness\" express in the original both moral and physical evil. Men sew the one and reap the other. Eliphaz extends this general rule into a universal law, or, at any rate, declares that he has never known an exception. He has not, therefore, been grieved and perplexed, like David, by \"seeing the ungodly in such prosperity\" (Psalm 73:3). He would seem not to have been a man of very keen observation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - By the blast of God they perish; rather, by the breath of God, as in Job 37:10. The word used (גִשְׁמָה) means always, as Professor Lee observes,\" a slight or gentle breathing.\" The slightest breath of God's displeasure is enough to destroy those against whom it is directed. And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. Here \"blast\" would be better than \"breath,\" for רוח is a stronger word than נשׁמה. Similarly, רוח is a stronger word than יאבדו. The breath kills, the blast utterly consumes, transgressors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. Wicked men, especially oppressors, are often compared to lions in Scripture (see Psalm 7:2; Psalm 10:9; Psalm 17:12, etc.; Ezekiel 19:3, 5; Nahum 2:12; Zephaniah 3:3, etc.). The meaning of Eliphaz is that, within his experience, all classes of wicked men, young, or old, or middle-aged, weak or strong, have received in this life the reward of their iniquity. However fiercely they might roar, however greedily they might devour, their roaring has died away, their teeth have been broken in their mouths, vengeance has lighted on them in some shape or other; they have paid the penalty of their transgressions. Five classes of lions seem to be spoken of in this and the following verses:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the whelp (ver. 11);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the half-grown lion, just able to make its voice heard;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the young full-grown lion (cephir);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the lion in full maturity (ariyeh); andNEWLINENEWLINE(5) the old lion which is growing decrepit (laish).NEWLINENEWLINETo these is joined (ver. 11) labi, \"the lioness.\" Lions are still frequent in the Mesopotamian region ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp 39, 221), though no longer found in Palestine, nor in Arabia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The old lion perisheth for lack of prey. The human counterpart of the \"old lion\" is the oppressor whose strength and cunning begin to fail him, who can no longer carry things with a high hand, enforce his will on men by bluster and throats, or even set traps for them so skilfully that they blindly walk into them. Political charlatans whose role is played out, bullies whose nerve is beginning to fail, cardsharpers whose manual dexterity has de-sorted them, come under this category. And the stout lion's whelps; rather, the whelps of the lioness (see the Revised Version). Are scattered abroad. Even the seed of ill-doers suffer. They are involved in their parents' punishment (see Exodus 20:5). Eliphaz darkly hints that Job may have been among the class of oppressors, or (at any rate) of transgressors, and that the untimely fate of his children may have been the consequence of his evil-doings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-21. - Eliphaz proceeds to narrate a spiritual experience of a very strange and striking character. It was night, and he had fallen asleep, when suddenly he was, or seemed to himself to be, awake. A horrible fear came over him, and all his limbs trembled and quaked. Then a spirit seemed to pass before his face, while every hair on his body rose up and stiffened with horror. It did not simply pass across him, but stood still, in a formless form, which he could see but not clearly distinguish. There was a deep hush. Then out of the silence there seemed to come a voice, a whisper, which articulated solemn words. \"Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man,\" etc.? Supernatural visitations were vouchsafed by God to many besides the chosen people - to Laban, when he pursued Jacob (Genesis 31:24), to Abimelech (Genesis 20:6), to the Pharaoh of the time of Joseph (Genesis 41:1-7), to his chief butler (Genesis 40:9-11), and his chief baker (Genesis 40:16, 17), to Balaam the son of Beer (Numbers 22:12, 20; Numbers 23:5-10, 16-24; Numbers 24:3-9, 15-24), to Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2:28-35; Daniel 4:1-32), and others. The method and manner of these visitations raise a multitude of questions which it is impossible to answer, but are convincing evidence to all who believe Scripture to be true, that communications can pass between the spiritual and material worlds of a strange and mysterious character. The communication to Eliphaz may have been a mere vision, impressed upon his mind in sleep, or it may have been actually brought to him by a spiritual messenger, whom he could dimly see, and whose voice he was privileged to hear. Modern pseudo-science pronounces such seeing and hearing to be impossible. But poets are often clearer-sighted than scientists, and Shakespeare utters a pregnant truth when he says -NEWLINENEWLINE\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,NEWLINEThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" Verse 12. - Now a thing was secretly brought to me; rather, a word (or, a message) was brought to me stealthily. And mine ear received a little thereof; rather, a whisper thereof (see the Revised Version, and comp. Job 26:14, and the Vulgate, which gives susurrus). As the form of the vision was not distinct to Eliphaz's eyes (ver. 16), so neither were the words which were uttered distinct to his ears. He thinks himself able, however, to give the sense of them (see vers. 17-21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - In thoughts from the visions of the night; literally, in the perplexities of the visions of night; i.e. \"in that perplexing time when - how, they know not - visions come to men.\" The word translated \"thoughts\" occurs only here and in Job 20:2. When deep sleep falleth on men. Something more than ordinary sleep seems to be meant - something more approaching to what we call \"trance\" (comp. Genesis 2:21; Genesis 15:12; 1 Samuel 26:12, where the same word is used).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Fear came upon me, and trembling; compare the \"horror of great darkness\" which fell upon Abraham (Genesis 15:12). Our nature shrinks from direct contact with the spiritual world, and our earthly frame shudders at the unearthly presence. Which made the multitude of my bones to shake; or, which made my bones greatly to shake (so the LXX.' Professor Lee, and others).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Then a spirit passed before my face. It has been argued (Rosenmuller) that \"a breath of air,\" and not \"a spirit,\" is intended; but, in that ease, how are we to understand the expressions in the following verse: \"it stood still,\" \"the form thereof,\" \"an image\"? A breath of air, the very essence of which is to be in motion, cannot stand still, nor has it any \"form,\" \"appearance,\" or \"imago.\" Granted that the Hebrew ruakh (רוח) may mean - like the Greek πνεῦμα, and the Latin spiritus - either an actual spirit, or a breath, a wind, it follows that, in every place where it occurs, we must judge by the context which is meant. Here certainly the context points to an actual living spirit, as what Eliphaz intended. Whether a spirit really appeared to him is a separate question. The whole may have been a vision; but certainly the impression left on Eliphaz was that he had had a communication from the spirit-world. The hair of my flesh stood up. Not the hair of his head only, but every hair on his whole body, stiffened, bristled, and rose up on end in horror (see the comment on ver. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof. Canon Cook quotes, very appositely, Milton's representation of Death as a fearful shape,NEWLINENEWLINE\"If shape it could be called that shape had noneNEWLINEDistinguishable in member, joint, or limb,NEWLINEOr substance might be called that shadow seemed.\" An image was before mine eyes; or, on appearance (LXX., μορφή). There was silence; or, a hush - \"status aeris nullo motu turbati, et tranquillissimus\" (Schulteus). And I heard a voice, saying. After a while the silence was broken by a voice, which whispered in Eliphaz's ear (setup. ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Shall mortal man be more just than God? Is it to be supposed that the ways of God can be rightly criticized and condemned by man? Surely not; for then man must be more penetrated with the spirit of justice than the Almighty. If our thoughts are not as God's thoughts, it must be, our thoughts that are wrong. Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Equally impossible. God alone is absolutely pure. The best man must be conscious to himself, as Isaiah was (Isaiah 6:5), of uncleanness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Behold, he put no trust in his servants; rather, he putteth no trust or he putteth not trust. The\" servants\" intended are those that minister to him directly in heaven, the members of the angelic host, as appears from the parallelism of the other clause of the verse. Even in them God does not trust implicitly, since he knows that they are frail and fallible, liable to err, etc., only kept from sin by his own sustaining and assisting grace (setup. Job 15:15, where Eliphaz expresses the same belief in his own person). And his angels he charged with folly; rather, chargeth. The exact meaning of the word translated \"folly\" is uncertain, since the word does not occur elsewhere. The LXX. renders by σκολιόν τι, \"crookedness;\" Ewald, Dillmann, and others, by \"error.\" The teaching clearly is that the angels are not perfect - the highest angelic excellence falls infinitely short of God's perfectness. Even angels, therefore, would be incompetent judges of God's doings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay! rather, hew muck more cloth he not put trust in them that inhabit houses of clay! i.e. \"earthly bodies,\" bodies made out of the dust of the ground (Genesis 2:7; setup, Job 33:6). Whose foundation is in the dust; i.e.\" whose origin was the dust of the ground,\" which were formed from it and must return to it, according to the words of Genesis 3:19, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou must return.\" Which are crushed before the moth. This is somewhat obscure. It may mean, \"which are so fragile that a moth, a fly, or other weak creature may destroy them,\" or \"which are crushed with the same ease with which a moth is crushed and destroyed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They are destroyed from morning to evening. Human bodies undergo a continuous destruction. From the moment that we are born we begin to die. Decay of powers is coeval with their first exercise. Our insidious foe, Death, marks us as his own from the very first breath that we draw. Our bodies are machines wound up to go for a certain time. The moment that we begin to use them we begin to wear them out. They perish for ever. The final result is that Our\" houses of clay \"perish, crumble to dust, disappear, and come to nothing. They \"perish for ever,\" says Eliphaz, repeating what he believed the spirit of ver. 15 to have said to him; but it is not clear that he understood more by this than that they perish and disappear for ever, so far as this life and this world are concerned. Without any regarding it. No one is surprised or thinks it hard. It is the lot of man, and every one's mind is prepared for it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Doth not their excellency which is in them go away! \"Their excellency\" (יתרם) would seem to mean that which is highest in them - their spirit, or soul. It does not make much difference if we translate, with the Old Testament Revisers\" their tent-cord,\" since that would be merely a metaphor for the soul, which sustains the body as the tent-cord does the tent. What deserves especial remark is that the \"excellency\" does not perish; it goes away, departs, or is removed. They die, even without wisdom; literally, not in wisdom; i.e. not having learnt in the whole course of their lives that true wisdom which their life-trials were intended to teach them.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCall now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-27. - Eliphaz, having narrated his vision, and rehearsed the words which the spirit spoke in his ear, continues in his own person, first (vers. 1-7) covertly reproaching Job, and then (vers. 8-27) seeking to comfort him by the suggestion that, if he will place himself unreservedly in the hands of God, it is still possible that God may relent, remove his chastening hand, deliver him from his troubles, and even give him back all his former prosperity. The anticipation is in remarkable accordance with the ultimate event (Job 42:10-17), and shows that Eliphaz, if not a prophet in the higher sense, is at least a sagacious interpreter of God's ways with men, and can very happily forecast the future. Verse 1. - Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; rather, call now; is there any that will answer thee? What aid, that is, wilt thou invoke, if thou turnest away from God, and reproachest him? Thinkest thou to find any one in heaven or earth to answer to the call and come to thy assistance? Utterly vain is any such hope. And to which of the saints wilt thou turn? By \"the saints\" are meant in this place \"the holy angels\" (comp. Job 15:15; Psalm 89:7; Zechariah 14:5). The question, \"To which wilt thou turn?\" seems to imply that there was already in Job's time some knowledge of individual members of the angelic host, such as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, etc., though we have no mention of any names of angels in Scripture until the time of Daniel (Daniel 8:16; Daniel 9:21). That invocation of angels was an actual practice in Job's age is, however, scarcely proved by this passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. For \"wrath\" and \"envy \"others suggest \"vexaation\" and \"impatience\" (Lee), or \"vexation\" and \"jealousy\" (Revised Version). The connection of thought seems to be, \"For thou art quite foolish enough to let thy vexation and impatience prompt thee to such a course, which could only lead to thy destruction.\" Eliphaz is quite sure that trust in any other beside God, and appeal to any other against God, is utter folly, sinful infatuation, and must lead to the ruin of whoever indulges in it. Thus the invocation of angels receives no countenance from him, but the contrary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I have seen the foolish taking root. The \"I\" is emphatic. \"I myself have seen,\" etc. What Eliphaz had seen was that folly, i.e. sinful infatuation, was always punished. It might seem to prosper: the foolish man might seem to be taking root; but Eliphaz was not deceived by appearances - he saw through them, he knew that there was a curse upon the man's house, and so pronounced it accursed. And the ruin which he had foreseen, it is implied, followed. But suddenly; rather, immediately, without hesitation. I cursed his habitation; i.e. \"pronounced it accursed, declared that the curse of God rested upon it?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His children are far from safety. The sins of the fathers arc visited upon the children. Eliphaz makes covert allusion to the death of Job's children (Job 1:19). Feeling, however, that he is on delicate ground, he goes on into details which in no way fit their case. And (he says) they are crushed in the gate; i.e. they are oppressed, crushed, by litigations. The house once smitten of God, human beasts of prey enter in; claims are made against the children; lawsuits commenced; all the arts of chicanery set in motion; every effort made to strip them of their last penny. (For the sense here assigned to \"the gate,\" see Job 29:7 and Job 31:21.) Neither is there any to deliver them. No one intercedes on their behalf, undertakes their detente in the courts, or makes any effort to avert their ruin. This picture of legal oppression accords very closely with what we know of the East in all ages (comp. Isaiah 1:17, 23; Isaiah 3:14, 15; Isaiah 5:23; Isaiah 10:2, etc.). Oriental cowardice causes men to shrink from casting in their lot with those whom Misfortune has marked as her own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Whose harvest the hungry eateth up. Covetous men rush in and \"eat up\" all that the family possesses, thus bringing it to the extreme of poverty and want. And taketh it even out of the thorns. Vain is any protection that may be devised. As hedges, even of the prickly pear, do not keep out a band of plunderers, so there is no obstacle which those bent on robbing them will not overcome. And the robber swalloweth up their substance; or, the thirsty; i.e. those who thirst after it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlthough affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground. There is a tacit reference to what was said in Job 4:8. Affliction and trouble are not chance products of spontaneous growth. They only spring up when men have prepared the ground for them, and planted in it an evil seed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Yet man is born unto trouble. Yet still, in point of fact, man is born to trouble. He has a corrupt nature, and always sins more or less. Each sin brings him into trouble, since it entails on him a punishment. As the sparks fly upward; literally, the sons of flame. Some suppose \"meteoric flashes\" to be meant: others suggest, \"ignited arrows.\" But many good Hebraists maintain the rendering of the Authorized Version (see Buxtorf, 'Lexicon,' p. 757; Rosenmuller, 'Scholia,' vol. 5. p. 165; Canon Cook, 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I would seek unto God; rather, as in the Revised Version; but as for me, I would seek etc.; i.e. if the case were mine, if I were afflicted as thou art, I would not betake myself to any of the angels (see ver. 1), but would cast myself wholly upon God. It is necessarily implied that Job had not done so. And unto God would I commit my cause (comp. Psalm 37:5; Proverbs 16:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Which doeth great things and unsearchable. These are reasons why Job should \"seek unto God.\" \"Great things are those which he has done.\" There is none like unto him. His ways are \"unsearchable;\" no one may think fully to search them and seek them out (comp. Job 9:10; Job 37:5; Psalm 145:3: Romans 11:33). It may be that, if Job will appeal to him, a result will follow that at present seems impossible. For he doeth marvellous things without number (comp. Psalm 40:5; Psalm 72:18; Psalm 77:14; Psalm 136:4). Eliphaz proceeds to mention some of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Who giveth rain upon the earth. To the dweller in the parched regions of South-Western Asia rain is the greatest of all blessings, and seems the greatest, of all marvels. When for months and months together the sun has blazed all day long out of a cloudless sky, when the heaven that is over his head has been brass, and the earth that is under him iron (Deuteronomy 28:33), a great despair comes upon him, and that it should ever rain again seems almost an impossibility. Where is the rain to come from? From that cruel, glaring sky, which has pursued him with its hostility week after week, and month after month? Or from that parched earth in which, as it seems, no atom of moisture is left? When God at length gives rain, he scarcely believes his eyes. What? The blessed moisture is once more descending from the sky, and watering the earth, and quickening what seemed dead, and turning the desert into a garden! All Eastern poetry is full of the praises of rain, of its blessedness, of its marvellousness, and of its quickening power. Very naturally Eliphaz, in speaking of God's marvellous works of mercy, mentions rain first, as, within his experience, one of the chief. And sendeth waters upon the fields. This is either the usual pleonastic repetition of the second hemistich, or (perhaps) a reference to the fountains and rills of water, which spring into being as a consequence of the rain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To set up on high those that be low. God's physical blessings are intended to subserve moral ends. He gives his rain, both the former and the latter, to raise up men from despair, to enable them to see in him a God of mercy as well as a God of vengeance; and with the same object, after withholding it from us for a while, he pours into our parched hearts the dew of his Holy Spirit. That those which mourn may be exalted to safety; or, \"raised to safety\" (Lee).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He disappointeth the devices of the crafty; or, frustrateth - makes them of no effect (comp. Psalm 33:10; Isaiah 8:10). Some suppose Eliphaz to insinuate here that Job's apparent wisdom has not been true wisdom, but cunning or craft, and that therefore God has brought it to nought. But to us it rather seems that he enunciates a.general sentiment, and a true one. He is giving examples of the \"marvellous things\" which God does (ver. 9), and naturally enumerates among them his victories over the craft and cunning of his adversaries (comp. Isaiah 44:25). So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise; literally, and their hands accomplish nothing solid. No substantial result is effected by all their scheming.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. Men are, as Shakespeare says, \"hoist with their own petard.\" They \"fall into their own nets together\" (Psalm 141:11), while the godly, their intended prey, \"escape them.\" And this is God's doing - it is his providence which brings it to pass. And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong; or, \"put to confusion\" (Lee).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They meet with darkness in the daytime (comp Deuteronomy 28:29 and Isaiah 59:10). The metaphor expresses the bewilderment of the crafty, when they find their schemes foiled, and all their subtlety of no avail. Suddenly their light goes out; they know not what to do, or which way to turn; \"their way is hid\" (Job 3:23); they are baffled, perplexed, confounded. And grope in the noonday as in the night (comp. Job 12:25). A variant form of the preceding hemistich.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But he sayeth the poor from the sword, from their mouth; rather, from the sword of their mouth; i.e. from their cruel and destructive words (Psalm 57:4; Psalm 64:3; Proverbs 12:18), which cut \"like a sharp razor\" (Psalm 52:2). By calumny, innuendoes, lies, fraudulent representations, and the like, the ungodly work, perhaps, more injury than by their actions. And from the hand of the mighty. God delivers the poor both from their words and from their deeds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So the poor hath hope. With the fall of each crafty oppressor, the poor man's hopes revive. He feels that \"God ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world\" (Psalm 59:13). He recognizes the fact that the Almighty \"maintains the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor\" (Psalm 140:12), that he is \"a Refuge for the oppressed, a Refuge in times of trouble\" (Psalm 9:9). And iniquity stoppeth her mouth (comp. Psalm 107:42). Either \"the oppressors themselves are struck dumb, recognizing the fact that God is against them;\" or \"those who perversely question God's ways are struck dumb, seeing his retributive justice.\" If we understand the passage in the latter sense, we may see in it a reproof of Job's murmurs against his treatment by God (Job 3:11-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth! This \"opens,\" as Professor Lee observes, \"a new view of the subject.\" Hitherto Eliphaz has regarded afflictions as simply punitive. Now it occurs to him that they are sometimes chastisements. The difference is that punishment has regard only to the past, to the breach of the moral law committed, and the retribution which has to follow it. Chastisement looks to the future. It aims at producing an effect in the mind of the person chastised, at benefiting him, and raising him in the scale of moral being. In this point of view afflictions are blessings (see Hebrews 12:5-11). Recognizing this, Eliphaz suddenly bursts out with the acknowledgment, \"Happy is the man [or, 'blessings on the man'] whom God correcteth!\" (Comp. Proverbs 3:11, 12; Psalm 94:12; 1 Corinthians 11:32). He suggests to Job the idea that his sufferings are not punishments, but chastisements - that they may be but for a time. Let him receive them in a proper spirit; let him humble himself under them, and they may work altogether for his good, his latter end may surpass his early promise. Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. Words quoted by the authors of Proverbs (Proverb s3:11), and of the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 12:5), and well deserving to be laid up in the recollection of all faithful souls. They remind us that God's chastenings are blessings or the contrary, as we make them. Accepted humbly, they improve men, exalt the moral character, purge it of its dross, and bring it nearer to the perfection at which God would have us aim (Matthew 5:48). Rejected, chafed against, received with discontent and murmurings, they injure us, cause our characters to deteriorate, sink us instead of raising us in the moral scale. Job was now undergoing the ordeal - with what result remained to be determined.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For he maketh sore, and bindeth up. Metaphors drawn from the healing art. He \"maketh sore\" - applies the scalpel and the cautery when and where they are needed; and then, after a while, \"bindeth up\" - employs his lint and bandages; in both cases alike seeking the good of the sufferer. He woundeth, and his hands make whole (setup. Deuteronomy 32:39; Hosea 6:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven (comp. Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13, \"For three transgressions... and for four\"). An idiomatic way of expressing an indefinite number. There shall no evil touch thee; i.e. no real evil, nothing calculated to do thee real hurt. All affliction is \"for the present grievous;\" but if it \"afterward yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby\" (Hebrews 12:11), it does not do us harm, but good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In famine he shall redeem thee from death. Famine appears throughout the whole of Scripture as one of God's severest chastisements (see Leviticus 26:19, 20; Deuteronomy 28:22-24; 2 Samuel 21:1; 2 Samuel 24:13; 2 Kings 8:1; Psalm 105:16; Isaiah 14:30; Jeremiah 24:10; Revelation 18:8). Ezekiel speaks of \"the sword, the famine the noisome beast, and the pestilence,\" as God's \"four sore judgments\" (Ezekiel 14:21). Miraculous deliverances from famine are related in Genesis 41:29-36; 1 Kings 17:10-16; 2 Kings 7:1-16. And in war from the power of the sword. In war God protects whom he will, and they seem to have charmed lives. They are covered with his feathers, and safe under his wings (Psalm 91:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue (comp. Psalm 31:20). God will also protect his own from \"the scourge of the tongue,\" i.e. from calumny, from abuse, from bitter words (see the comment on ver. 15). Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh; rather, of devastation. \"Shod (שׁור) populationes, praedationes, calamitosas tempestates, terrae motus, ruinas, incendia, mala omnia vasti-tatem inducentia, amplectitur\" (Schultens).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - At destruction (rather, devastation) and famine; rather, dearth. The word is not the same as that used in ver. 20, but a weaker cue. Thou shalt laugh; \"Thou shalt smile\" (Lee). Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. \"The beasts of the earth\" - i.e. destructive and ferocious wild beasts, like the Indian \"man-eaters\" - are enumerated among God's \"four sore plagues\" (Ezekiel 14:21; comp. 2 Kings 17:25). In ancient times they were sometimes so numerous in a country that men were afraid to occupy it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; i.e. there shall be peace between thee and all the rest of God's creation, even \"the stones of the field,\" against which thou shalt not dash thy foot (Psalm 91:12); and if the senseless stones am thus in league with thee, and refrain from doing thee hurt, much more mayest thou be sure that the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. For they are not altogether senseless, and will in some sort understand that thou art under God's protection, and not to be molested by them (comp. Hosea 2:18, where God promises to make a covenant between his people and \"the beasts of the field, the fowls of heaven, and the creeping things of the ground,\" that so they may \"lie down safely \"). A misplaced ingenuity seeks to find either six or seven forms of calamity in the enumeration of vers. 20-23; but there appear to be really only five:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) famine;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) war;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) calumny;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) devastation; andNEWLINENEWLINE(5) noisome beasts.NEWLINENEWLINEThe expression used in ver. 19 - \"six, yea, seven\" - means, as already explained, an indefinite number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; rather, thy tent; i.e. thy habitation, whatever it may be. Thou shalt feel assured of peace in thy dwelling, since God's peace will rest upon it. And thou shalt visit thy habitation; or, thy fold (see the Revised Version). And shalt not sin; and shalt miss nothing (Revised Version). The exact meaning is very uncertain. Professor Lee renders, \"Thou shalt not err;\" Schultens, \"Thou shalt not be disappointed of thy desires;\" Rosenmuller, \"Thou shalt not miss thy mark.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great. Little by little Eliphaz passes from a general description of the blessedness of those faithful ones who \"despise not the chastening of the Almighty\" (ver. 17) to a series of allusions which seem specially to touch Job's case. Without claiming prophetical inspiration, he ventures to promise him in the future \"the exact reverse of all that he had experienced\" in the past - \"a safe home, flocks untouched, a happy and prosperous family, a peaceful old age\" (Cook). The promises may have sounded in Job's ears as \"a mockery\" (ibid.); but it is creditable to the sagacity of Eliphaz that he ventured to make them. And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. The ordinary symbols for multitudinous-ness - the sand of the sea, and the stars of heaven - are here superseded by an entirely new one, \"the grass of the earth.\" Undoubtedly it is equally appropriate, and perhaps more natural in a pastoral community.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age (comp. Genesis 15:15; Genesis 25:8; Genesis 35:29). Professor Lee translates, 'Thou shalt come to thy grave in honour.\" But, on the whole, the rendering of the Authorized Version may well stand. The expression used occurs only here and in Job 30:2. Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season; literally, is lifted up. The shocks of corn were lifted up, and placed on a cart, for transfer to the barn or the threshing-floor. The emphasis, however, is on the closing words, \"in his season.\" Eliphaz promises Job that he will reach a good ripe old age, and not die untimely. (For the result, see Job 42:17.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Lo this, we have searched it, so it is. Eliphaz does not claim to be delivering a Divine message, or in any way stating results which he has learnt from revelation. Rather is he declaring what he has \"searched out;\" i.e. gathered with much trouble from inquiry, observation, and experience. He is, however, quite confident that he has arrived at a true conclusion, and expects Job to accept it and act upon it. Hear it, and know thou it for thy good; literally, for thyself. Make the knowledge, i.e. which I have communicated to thee, thine own. Professor Lee observes, \"Them is nothing in all this savouring of any asperity, as far as I can see, beyond the anxieties of true friendship. The sentiments delivered from ver. 17 to the end of the chapter are not only most excellent in themselves, but perfectly applicable to Job's case; and were, in the event, made good in every respect. It is true, we have not much sympathy expressed for Job's bereavements and afflictions. And, in this respect, Eliphaz was, no doubt, to blame\" ('Book of the Patriarch Job' p. 216).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - But Job answered and said, Oh that my grief were throughly weighed! rather, my anger, or my vexation - the same word as that used by Eliphaz when reproaching Job, in Job 5:2. Job wishes that, before men blame him, they would calmly weigh the force of his feelings and expressions against the weight of the calamity which oppresses him. His words may seem too strong and too violent; but are they more than a just counterpoise to the extreme character of his afflictions? The weighing of words and thoughts was an essential element in the Egyptian conception of the judgment, where Thoth held the balance, and in the one scale were placed the merits of the deceased, in the other the image of Ma, or Truth, and his fate was determined by the side to which the balance inclined ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. 125; Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 5. p. 252). And my calamity laid in the balances together. My calamity placed in one scale, and my vexation in the other, and so weighed, each against each.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea (comp. Proverbs 27:3, \"A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both;\" see also Ecclus. 22:15). Therefore my words are swallowed up; rather, as in the Revised Version, therefore have my words been rash. Job here excuses without justifying himself. The excessive character of his sufferings has, he declares, forced him to utter rash and violent words, as these wherein he cursed his day and wished that he had never been born (Job 3:1, 3-11). Some allowance ought to be made for rash speech uttered under such circumstances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For the arrows of the Almighty are wlthin me (comp. Psalm 38:2, \"For thine arrows stick fast in me\"). So Shakespeare speaks of \"the slings and arrows el outrageous fortune\" for calamities generally. The metaphor is a very common one (see Deuteronomy 32:23, 42; Psalm 7:13; Psalm 21:12; Psalm 45:5; Lamentations 3:13, 14). The poison whereof. Poisoned arrows, such as are now employed by the savage tribes of Central Africa, were common in antiquity, though seldom used by civilized nations. Ovid declares that the Scythians of his time made use of them ('Tristia,' 1, 2). Drinketh up my spirit; rather, my spirit drinketh up. Job's spirit absorbs the poison that festers in his wounds, and therefore loses control over itself. This is his apology for his vehemence; he is well-nigh distraught. He adds, The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. Besides actual pains and sufferings, he is assailed by fears. God's terrors, i.e. all the other evils that he has at his disposal, are drawn up against him, as it were, in battle array, and still further agitate and distract his soul. What further troubles may not God bring upon him?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? literally, over grass; i.e. when he has grass under his feet, and has consequently no cause of complaint. Job means to say that his own complainings are as natural and instinctive as these of animals (On the species of wild asses known to Job, see the comment on Job 39:5.) Or loweth the ox over his fodder? The lowing of the ox, like the braying of the wild ass, is a complaint - a sign of distress and discomfort.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or, that which is insipid. Many critics suppose that in this and the following verse Job reproaches Eliphaz with the insipidity of his remarks, and declares that his soul refuses to touch such loathsome food. Others regard him as still speaking in his own defence, and justifying his expressions of disgust by the nauseous character of the food which had been put before him; i.e. of the treatment which he has received. Either explanation produces good sense; but perhaps the former is the more natural. Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? So our Revisers; and so Dillmann and Canon Cook. Professor Lee suggests \"the whey of cheese\" for \"the white of an egg;\" others, \"the juice of purslaine.\" We have certainly no other evidence that eggs were eaten in primitive times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The things that my soul refuse to touch are as my sorrowful meat; rather, as in the Revised Version, my soul refuseth to touch them; they are as loathsome meat to me. The doubt remains whether Job is speaking of the arguments of Eliphaz, or of the series of afflictions which have befallen him. Either explanation is possible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Oh that I might have my request! Here the second point is taken up. Eliphaz has threatened Job with death, representing it as the last and most terrible of punishments (Job 4:9, 20, 21; Job 5:2). Job's reply is that there is nothing he desires so much as death. His primary wish would have been never to have been born (Job 3:3-10); next to that, he would have desired an early death - the earlier the more acceptable (Job 3:11-19). As both these have been denied him, what he now desires, and earnestly asks for, is a speedy demise. It is not as yet clear what he thinks death to be, or whether he has any hope beyond the grave. Putting aside all such considerations, he here simply balances death against such a life as he now leads, and must expect to lead, since his disease is incurable, and decides in favour of death. It is not only his desire, but his \"request\" to God, that death may come to him quickly. And that God would grant me the thing that I long for; literally, my expectation or wish. The idea of taking his own life does not seem to have occurred to Job, as it would to a Greek (Plato, 'Phaedo,' § 16) or a Roman (Pithy, 'Epist.,' 1:12). He is too genuine a child of nature, too simple and unsophisticated, for such a thought to occur, and, if it occurred, would be too religious to entertain it for a moment. Like Aristotle, he would feel the act to be cowardly (Aristotle, 'Eth.

Isaiah 38:12, where the same word is used of a weaver, who cuts the threads of his loom one by one, until the whole is liberated and comes away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Then should I yet have comfort. First, the comfort that the end was come, and that he would be spared further sufferings; and further, the still greater comfort that he had endured to the end, and not. denied nor renounced his trust in religion and in all the \"words of the Holy One.\" Professor Lee sees here \"the recognition of a future life, expressed in words as plain and obvious as possible\" ('Book of the Patriarch Job,' p. 223). But to us it seems that, if the idea is present at all, it is covered up, latent; only so far implied as it may be said to be implied in all willingness to die, since it may be argued that even the most wretched life possible would be preferred by any man to no life at all, and so that when men are content to die they must be expecting, whether consciously or not, a life beyond the grave, and be sustained by that expectation. Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; rather, yea, I would exult in anguish that did not spare. However great the pain that accompanied his death, Job would rejoice and exult in it, since by it his death was to be accomplished. For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One; rather, for I have not denied or renounced. It would be a part of Job's satisfaction in dying that he had not let go his integrity. Rather he had held it fast, and not renounced or abandoned his trust in God and in religion. \"The words of the Holy One are the commands of God, however made known to man\" (Canon Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - What is my strength, that I should hope? Eliphaz had suggested that Job might recover and be restored to his former prosperity (Job 5:18-26). Job rejects this suggestion. His strength is brought too low; it is not conceivable that he should be restored, he cannot entertain any such hope. And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? rather, that I should stretch out my spirit. Job cannot look forward to such an \"end\" as Eliphaz prophesies for him; therefore he cannot bring himself to wait on with patience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? It would require a man to have a body of brass, and strength like that of rocks, for him to be able to endure the ravages of such a disease, and yet to recover from it. Job cannot pretend to either.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Is not my help in me? rather, Is it not that I have no help in me? (Revised Version). Job feels that, instead of having exceptional strength of constitution to enable him to bear up against his exhausting malady, he is absolutely without strength. All his vital power is used up. There is no help in him. And is wisdom driven quite from me? rather, Is not soundness driven quite from me? Tushiyah seems to mean here \"strength of constitution\" - that internal soundness which resists the inroads of disease, and sometimes triumphs over the most serious maladies. Whatever reserve of this kind he may have possessed by nature, it is now, Job feels, altogether lost and gone from him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend. Job begins here the third head of his reply to Eliphaz, in which he attacks him and his companions. The first duty of a comforter is to compassionate his afflicted friend, to condole with him, and show his sympathy with his sufferings. This is what every one looks for and expects as a matter of course. But Job has looked in vain. He has received no pity, no sympathy. Nothing has been offered him but arguments. And what arguments! How do they touch the point? How are they anything more than a venting of the speaker's own self-righteousness? Let them fairly consider his case, and point out to him where he has been blamable. But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty; rather, even though he forsake the fear of the Almighty, or else might he forsake the fear of the Almighty. Job certainly does not mean to admit that he has renounced the fear of God, and become an apostate from religion; but only to assert, either, that, even had he done so, his friends ought still to have shown him kindness, or else that their not showing him kindness is the very way to drive him to apostasy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My brethren; i.e. \"my three friends,\" Eliphaz, who has spoken; Bildad and Zophar, who by their silence have shown their agreement with him. Have dealt deceitfully as a brook; i.e. \"a winter torrent\" - a \"wady,\" to use the modern Arab expression. These watercourses are characteristic of Palestine and the adjacent regions. \"During the winter months,\" says Dr. Cunningham Geikie, \"they are often foaming rivers; but in the hot summer, when they would be of priceless value, their dry bed is generally the road from one point to another. The water rushes over the sheets of rock as it would from the roof of a house, and converging, as it descends, into minor streams in the higher wadies, these sweep on to a common channel in some central valley, and, thus united, swell in an incredibly short time into a deep, troubled, roaring flood, which fills the whole bottom of the wady with an irresistible torrent... The streams from Lebanon, and also from the high mountains of the Hauran. send down great floods of dark and troubled waters in spring, when the ice and snow of their summits are melted; but they dry up under the heat of summer, and the track of the torrent, with its chaos of boulders, stones, and gravel, seems as if it had not known a stream for ages. So Job's friends had in former times seemed as if they would be true to him for ever; but their friendship had vanished, like the rush of the torrent that had passed away\" ('The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 123-125). And as the stream of brooks they pass away; or, the channel; i.e. the wady itself. Canon Cook well says on this, \"The simile is remarkably complete. When little needed, the torrent overflows; when needed, it disappears. In winter it does not fertilize; in summer it is dried up. Nor is it merely useless; it deceives, alluring the traveller by the appearance of verdure, promising refreshment, and giving none.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Which are blackish by reason of the ice. Job seems to have seen wadys where, in the winter-time, the water was actually frozen into hard black ice. This scarcely occurs now in the countries bordering on Palestine; but may have occurred in the region where Job dwelt, formerly. \"Dark, turbid water\" can scarcely be intended. And wherein the snow is hid. Some suppose melted snow to be meant; but the deep wadies in the Hauran and elsewhere would easily conceal snowdrifts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place (see the passage quoted from Dr. Geikie in the comment on ver. 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The paths of their way are turned aside; rather, as in the Revised Version, the caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside. It seems impossible that the streams can be intended, since their paths are never \"turned aside\" - they simply shrink, fail, and dry up. But nothing is commoner than for caravans short of water to go out of their way in order to reach a wady, where they expect to be able to replenish their water-skins. If they are disappointed, if the wady is dry, they may be brought into great straits, and may even possibly perish. (For a probable instance, where dependence on a wady would, but for a miracle, have led to a great disaster, see 2 Kings 3:9-20.) They go to nothing, and perish; rather, they go up into the waste and perish. Having vainly sought water in the dry wady, they ascend out of it, and enter the broad waste of the desert, where they too often miserably perish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The troops of Tema looked. The Tema were an Arab tribe descended from Ishmael (Genesis 25:15). They are generally conjoined with Dedan (Isaiah 21:13, 14; Jeremiah 25:23), another Arab tribe, noted for carry-lug on a caravan trade. Both tribes probably wandered, and occupied at different periods different portions of the desert. The name, Tema, may linger in the modern city and district of Tayma on the confines of Syria, and upon the pilgrim-route between Damascus and Mecca. The \"troops of Tema\" probably looked for the \"caravans\" of ver. 18 to arrive in their country; but they looked in vain. The desert had swallowed them up. The companies of Sheba waited for them. (On \"Sheba,\" see the comment upon Job 1:15.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They were confounded because they had hoped. Shame and confusion of face came upon them in consequence of their vain hope. In the same way, Job implies, he is ashamed of having looked for compassion and kindness from his friends. He should have been wiser and have known better. They came thither, and were ashamed. They not only hoped, but acted on their hope-let it turn them aside from their way (ver. 18) and bring them to ruin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For now ye are nothing. Like the dried-up torrents, the comforters had come to nought; were wholly useless and unprofitable. Another reading gives the sense, \"Ye are like to them\" - \"ye comforters,\" i.e., \"are like the winter torrents, and have misled me, as they misled the caravans.\" Ye see my casting down, and are afraid. Here Job penetrates to the motive which had produced the conduct of his friends. They had come with good intentions, meaning to comfort and console him; but when they came, and saw what a wreck he was, how utterly \"broken up\" and ruined, they began to be afraid of showing too much friendliness. They thought him an object of the Divine vengeance, and feared lest, if they showed him sympathy, they might involve themselves in his punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDid I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Did I say, Bring unto me? The meaning is probably - If this be the case, if ye are afraid of helping me, why have ye come? Did I ask for your aid? No. I neither requested you to bring me anything for myself, nor to make a present to any one on my behalf; much less did I call upon you to deliver me out of the hand of my enemies, to chastize the Chaldeans and the men of Sheba (Job 1:15, 17), and recover. from them my property. No; I asked nothing at all of you; but when you came voluntarily, I did expect your pity (ver. 14). Or, Give a reward for me of your substance? i.e. give a present on my behalf to some influential person, who might thereupon take up my cause and befriend me. There is no need of supposing a \"bribe\" to be meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? rather, from the hand of the violent man. Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? literally, of the oppressor (see the Revised Version). Job had not called on his friends to do any of these things. He had not worn out their patience by asking now for this, and now for that. But he had expected their compassion, and this was denied him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTeach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Teach me, and I will hold my tongue. Job is willing to be taught, if his friends have any instruction to give. He is willing to be reproved. But not in such sort as he has been reproved by Eliphas. His words were not \"words of uprightness.\" Cause me to understand wherein I have erred. Point out, that is, in what my assumed guilt consists. You maintain that my afflictions are deserved. Point out what in my conduct has deserved them. I am quite ready to be convinced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - How forcible are right words! literally, words of uprightness. Such words have a force that none can resist. If the charges made by Eliphaz had been right and true, and his arguments sound and just, then Job must have yielded to them, have confessed himself guilty, and bowed down with shame before his judges. But they had had no such constraining power. Therefore they were not \"words of uprightness.\" But what doth your arguing reprove? literally, What doth your reproving reprove? That is - What exactly is it that ye think to be wrong in me? At what is your invective aimed?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Do ye imagine to reprove words? or, Do ye propose? \"Is it your intention?\" Am I to understand that you blame nothing in my conduct, but only the words that I have spoken? i.e. the words recorded in ch. 3. And the speeshes of one that is desperate, which are as wind; or, whereas the speehes of one that is desperate are but as wind; literally, for the wind - spoken to the wind, for the wind to take hold of them and bear them away. Therefore not worth a reproof.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless; rather, on the fatherless would ye east lots (comp. Joel 3:3; Obadiah 1:11; Nahum 3:10). Job means to say they are so pitiless that they would cast lots for the children of an insolvent debtor condemned to become slaves at his death (see 2 Kings 4:1; Nehemiah 5:5). And ye dig a pit for your friend; or, ye would make merchandise of your friend as in the Revised Version. Job does not speak of what his friends had done, but of what he deems them capable of doing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Now therefore be content, look upon me; rather, be pleased to look upon me. Professor Lee translates, \"Look favorably upon me.\" But this addition is unnecessary. What Job desires is that his friends would look him straight in the face. Then they would not be able to doubt him. They would see that he was telling the truth. For it is evident unto you if I lie; rather, it will be evident unto you, etc. Others render the passage, \"For surely I shall not lie to your face\" (Schultens, Canon Cook, Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReturn, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Return, I pray you; i.e. \"go back upon my case: reconsider it.\" And then, Let it not be iniquity; or, let there be no iniquity; i.e. let no injustice be done me. Yea, return again, my righteousness is in it If my cause be well considered, it will be seen that I am in no way blameworthy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Is there iniquity in my tongue? (see ver. 26). Job now justifies his words, which previously he had admitted to have been \"rash\" (ver. 3). Perhaps he intends to distinguish between rashness and actual wickedness. Cannot my taste discern perverse things? i.e. I see no perversity or wickedness in what I have said. If there were any, I think I should discern it The reasoning is somewhat dangerous, since men are not infallible judges, not being unprejudiced judges, in their own case. Job's ultimate verdict on himself is that he has \"uttered that which he understood not\" (Job 42:3) - wherefore he \"abhors himself, and repents in dust and ashes\" (Job 42:6).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-21. - In this chapter Job first bewails his miserable fate, of which he expects no alleviation (vers. 1-10); then claims an unlimited right of complaint (ver. 11); and finally enters into direct expostulation with God - an expostulation which continues from ver. 12 to the end of the chapter. At the close, he admits his sinfulness (ver. 20), but asks impatiently why God does not pardon it instead of visiting it with such extreme vengeance (ver. 21). Verse 1. - Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? rather, Is there not a warfare (or, a time of service) to man upon earth? Has not each man a certain work appointed for him to do, and a certain limited time assigned him within which to do it? And thus, Are not his days also like the days of an hireling? Since the hireling is engaged to do a certain work in a certain time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - As a servant (or, a slave) panteth for the shadow; i.e. longs for the shades of evening to descend and bring the day to a close. The slavery of Job's time was probably not unlike that of captive races in Egypt, so graphically portrayed in the early chapters of Exodus. The captive, working from morning to night at exhausting labour, would long intensely for the night to arrive, when his toil would come to an end. The inference is not drawn, but clearly is - so Job may be excused if he longs for death, now that he has reached old age, and that the work of his life is manifestly ended. And as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work; rather, for his wages. The word used (פעל) has the two meanings of \"work\" and \"the wages of work\" (see Jeremiah 22:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - So am I made to possess months of vanity. \"Months of vanity\" are \"months of which he can make no use \" - \"months which are no good to him.\" It has been concluded from this theft some considerable time had elapsed since Job was stricken by his disease. But he is perhaps looking to the future as much as to the past, anticipating a long, lingering illness. Elephantiasis is a disease which often lasts for years. And wearisome nights are appointed to me. To one stretched on a bed of sickness, the night is always more wearisome than the day. It has no changes, nothing to mark its flight. It seems almost interminable. In elephantiasis, however, it is a special feature of the disease that the sufferings of the patient are greatest at night. \"In elephantiasis ansesthetica\" says Dr. Erasmus Wilson, \"a sense of dulness and heat pervades the surface, and there are sensations of tingling and prickling, and of burning heat. While the integument is insensible, there are deep-seated burning pains, sometimes of a bone or joint, sometimes of the vertebral column. These pains are greatest at night; they prevent sleep, and give rise to restlessness and frightful dreams\" (Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1. p. 817).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? So Gesenius, Rosenmuller, and Delitzsch. Others translate, \"the night is long\" (Dillmann, Renan), or \"the night seems endless\" (Merx); comp. Deuteronomy 28:67, \"At evening thou shalt say, Would God it were morning!\" And I am full of tossings to and fro. Professor Lee understands \"tossings of the mind,\" or \"distracting thoughts;\" but it is more probable that tossings of the body are meant. These are familiar to every bad sleeper. Unto the dawning of the day. A little rest sometimes visits the tired eyelids after a long, sleepless night. Job may refer to this, or he may simply mean that he lay tossing on his bed all through the night, till morning came, when he arose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - My flesh is clothed with worms. The leas et origo mall in elephantiasis is a worm called filaria sanguinis hominid. It is a long, fine, thread-like creature, of a white colour, smooth; and devoid of markings (Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1, pp. 512, 513). And clods of dust. This is rather poetical than strictly medical. The special characteristic of elephantiasis, from which it derives its name, is that the integument, or outer skin, is \"formed into large masses or folds, with a rugose condition of the surface, not unlike the appearance of an elephant's leg\" (Quain, vol. 1. p. 431). But the swellings do not contain clods of dust. My skin is broken, and become loathsome. A common feature in elephantiasis is the development and gradual growth of solid papules or tubercles in the skin. These enlarge as the disease progresses, and after a time soften and break up; an nicer is then formed, and a discharge follows of a virulent and loathsome character. Presently the discharge steps; the ulcer heals; but only to break out again in another place. In the Revised Version the passage is rendered, My skin closeth up, and breaketh afresh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle. Though each day is a weariness, yet, on looking back upon my whole life, it seems to have come and gone in a moment (comp. Job 9:25). And are spent without hope. Job does not share in the hopes which Eliphaz has held out (see Job 5:17-27). He has no hope but in death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - O remember that my life is wind! (comp. Psalm 78:39). The wind is an image of all that is vain, shifting, unstable, ready to pass away (Job 6:36; Proverbs 11:29; Ecclesiastes 5:16; Isaiah 26:18; Isaiah 41:9; Jeremiah 5:13, etc.). Mine eye shall no more see good. Another protest against the hopes flint Eliphaz has held out (see the comment on ver. 6; and setup, Job 9:25). Job is still speaking of this life only, and not touching the question of another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more; that is, I shall go down to the grave, and be no more seen upon earth. Neither friend nor enemy shall behold me after that. Thine eyes. God's eyes. God still sees him and watches him; this is a certain consolation; but will it last? Are upon me, and I am not. I am on the point of disappearing. Even now I scarcely exist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As the aloud is consumed and vanisheth away. In mountainous countries one sees clouds clinging to a mountain-side, which do not float away, but gradually shrink, and at last wholly disappear. They are \"consumed\" in the strictest sense of the word - the hot rays of the sun drink them up. So he that goeth down to the grave; rather, to Sheol; i.e. to the lower world, the abode of the departed. What exactly was Job's idea of this world it is impossible to say, or whether it involved the continued separate identity of individual souls and their continued consciousness. In Isaiah's conception both seem certainly to have been involved (Isaiah 14:9-18), and perhaps in Jacob's (Genesis 37:35); but Job s creed on the subject can only be conjectured. It is certain, however, that both the Egyptians and the early Babylonians held the continuance after death of individual souls, their separate existence, and their consciousness (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 317-319; and 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 62-65). Shall come up no more. The Egyptian belief was that the soul would ultimately return to the body from which death separated it, and rein-habit it. But this belief was certainly not general among the nations of antiquity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He shall return no more to his house. This is best taken literally. Men do not, after death, return to their houses and resume their old occupations. From the life in this world they disappear for ever. Neither shall his place know him any mere (comp. Psalm 103:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; rather, I moreover will not refrain my lips; that is, \"You may do as you like under affliction, I claim the right of complaining.\" Job has already pointed out that nature teaches the animals to complain when they suffer (Job 6:5). Why, then, should not he? Complaint is not necessarily murmuring; it is sometimes merely expostulation, which God allows (comp. Psalm 4:2; Psalm 77:3; Psalm 142:2, etc.). I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. Extreme \"anguish\" and \"bitter\" suffering excuse complaints that would otherwise be, blare-able (comp. Job 6:2-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAm I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Job now begins his complaint, which is wholly addressed to God. The heads of it are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that he is confined and restrained, allowed no liberty (ver. 12);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he is terrified by visions in the night (vers. 13, 14);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that he is not \"let alone\" (ver. 16);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) that so much attention is paid to him (vers. 17-19);NEWLINENEWLINE(5) that he is made a butt for God's arrows (ver. 20); andNEWLINENEWLINE(6) that he is not pardoned, but relentlessly persecuted (ver. 21). Am I a sea, or a whale? rather, Am I a sea or a sea-monster? Am I as wild and uncontrollable as the ocean, as fierce and savage as a crocodile or other monster of the deep? Do I not possess reason and conscience, by which I might be directed and guided? Why, then, am I treated as if I were without them? The sea must be watched, lest it break in upon the land; in Egypt there had been many such breaches, as the configuration of the coast, with its narrow belts of sand and its vast lagoons, shows; and crocodiles must be watched, lest they destroy human life; but is there any need that I should be watched, restrained, coerced, hedged in on every side (Job 3:23)? Am I so dangerous? Surely not. Some liberty therefore might have been safely given to me, instead of this irksome restraint. That thou settest a watch over me; or, a guard; i.e. a set of physical impediments, which leave me no freedom of action.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint. Sometimes, notwithstanding his many \"wearisome nights\" (ver. 5), Job would entertain a hope of a few hours' rest and tranquillity, as, wearied and exhausted, he sought his couch, and laid himself down upon it, but only to be disappointed. Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions. Unpleasant dreams are said to be a symptom, or at any rate a frequent concomitant, of elephantiasis; but Job seems to speak of something worse than these. Horrible visions came upon him, which he believed to be sent directly from the Almighty, and which effectually disturbed his rest, making night hideous. Probably this was one of the modes in which Satan was permitted to try and test him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So that my soul chooseth strangling; i.e. \"so that I would prefer strangling to such horrid dreams,\" which are worse than any physical sufferings. Some see here a reference to suicide: but this is s very forced explanation. Suicide, as already observed, seems never even to have occurred to the thoughts of Job (see the comment on Job 6:8). And death rather than my life; literally, rather than my bones. Death, that is, would be preferable to such a life as he leads, which is that of a living skeleton.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I loathe it; rather, I am wasted away - \"ulceratus tabesco\" (Schultens). I would not live alway; rather, I shall not live alway. Let me alone; for my days are vanity; literally, cease from me; i.e. \"cease to trouble me\" - with, perhaps, the further meaning. \"cease to trouble thyself about me;\" for I am sufficiently reduced to nothingness - my life is mere vanity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? or, make so much of him - regard him as of such great importance (comp. Psalm 8:4). It seems, at first sight, an exalted idea of God to regard him as too lofty, too great, to be really concerned about so mean a creature, so poor a being, as man. Hence, among the Greeks, the Epicureans maintained that God paid no attention at all to this world, or to anything that happened in it, but dwelt secure and tranquil in the empyrean, with nothing to disturb, displease, or vex him. And the holy men of old sometimes fell into this same phase of thought, and expressed surprise and wonder that God, who dwelt on high, should \"humble himself to consider the things in heaven and earth.\" \"Lord,\" says David, or whoever was the author of the hundred and forty-fourth psalm, \"what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? Man k like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away\" (Psalm 144:3, 4). But all, except Epicureans, agree that God does, in fact, so concern himself, and a little reflection is enough to show us that the opposite view, instead of exalting, really degrades God. To bring conscious, sentient beings into the world - beings capable of the intensest happiness or misery, and then to leave them wholly to themselves, to have no further care or thought of them, would be the part, not of a grand, glorious, and adorable Being, but of one destitute of any claim to our admiration. And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? This strong expression is not used of God elsewhere. But it well expresses the extreme tenderness and consideration that God has for man, and the deep love from which that tenderness and consideration spring.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And that thou shouldset visit him every morning, and try him every moment? Our whole life is a probation, not merely particular parts of it. God \"tries us every moment\" if not with afflictions, then with blessings; if not with pains, then with pleasures. He is with us all the day long, and all our life long, equally in his mercies and in his chastisements. But Job was probably thinking only of the latter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - How long wilt thou not depart from me? rather, Wilt thou not look away from me? (see the Revised Version). Job does not go so far as to ask that God should \"depart from\" him. He knows, doubtless, that that would be the extreme of calamity. But he would have God sometimes turn away his eyes from him, and not always regard him so intently. There is something of the same tone of complaint in the psalmist's utterance., \"Thou art about my path, and about my bed, and spiest out all my ways\" (Psalm 139:3, Prayer-book Version). Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? Even, i.e., for the shortest space of time passible. A proverbial expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I have sinned. This is not so much a confession as a concession, equivalent to \"Granting that I have sinned,\" or, \"Suppose that I have sinned.\" In that case, What shall I do unto thee? or, What can I do for thee? How is it in my power to do anything? Can I undo the past? Or can I make compensation in the future? Neither seems to Job to be possible. O thou Preserver of men; rather, thou Observer of men. A continuation of the complaint that God's eye is always upon him. Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee? \"A mark\" (מפגע) is either \"a butt,\" \"a target for arrows,\" or else \"an obstacle,\" \"a stumbling-block,\" which God, by repeated blows, is removing out of his way. The latter meaning is preferred by Schultens and Professor Lee; the former by Rosenmuller and our Revisers. So that I am a burden to myself (comp. Psalm 38:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21 - And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? Job feels that, if he has sinned, which he is ready to admit as possible, though he has certainly no deep conviction of sin (Job 6:24, 29, 30; Job 7:19), at any rate he has not sinned greatly, heinously; and therefore he cannot understand why he has not been forgiven. The idea that the Almighty cannot forgive sin except upon conditions, is unknown to him. Believing God to be a God of mercy, he regards him also, just as Nehemiah did, as a \"God of pardons\" (Nehemiah 9:17) - a belief which seems to have been instinctive with men of all nations. And it appears to him unaccountable that pardon has not been extended to himself. Like his \"comforters.\" he makes the mistake of supposing that all his afflictions have been penal, are signs of God's displeasure, and intended to crush and destroy him. He has not woke up to the difference between God's punishments and his chastisements. Apparently, he does not know that \"whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,\" or that men are \"made perfect through sufferings\" (Hebrews 2:10). For now shall I sleep in the dust. Now it is too late for pardon to avail anything. Death is nigh at hand. The final blow must soon be struck. And thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be. The idea seems to be - God will relent at last; he will seek to alleviate my sufferings; he will search for me diligently - but I shall have ceased to be.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said. Bildad the Shuhite has the second place in the passage where Job's friends are first mentioned (Job 2:11), and occupies the same relative position in the dialogue. We may suppose him to have been younger than Eliphaz and older than Zophar. He does little more than repeat the arguments of Eliphaz, stating them, however, more bluntly, and with less of tact and consideration. The chief novelties of his discourse are an appeal to the teaching of past ages (vers 8-10), and the employment of new and forcible metaphors (vers. 11-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - How long wilt thou speak these things? An exclamation like that of Cicero, \"Quousque tandem?\" One or two outbreaks might be pardoned; but to persist was to abuse the patience of his hearers. And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? literally, be a strong wind; i.e. have all the bluster and vehemence of a tempest, which seeks to carry everything before it by sheer force and fury. The address is rude and unsympathetic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Doth God pervert judgment? This was, no doubt, what Job's words of expostulation might seem to imply. But he had never gone so far as to make the direct charge, and a true friend would have shrunk from taxing him with an impiety, witch could only be deduced from his speech by way of inference. It is our duty to put the best construction that we can on our friends' words, no less than upon their actions. Or doth the Almighty pervert justice? \"Justice\" is not altogether the same thing with \"judgment.\" Judgment is the act, justice the principle which underlies or ought to underlie the act. It is, of course, impossible for God to pervert either. \"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" (Genesis 18:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If thy children have sinned against him. Bildad assumes this absolutely; Eliphaz had only hinted at it (Job 10:4). Both presume to know what could be known only to the Searcher of hearts. And he have cast them away for their transgression; literally, and he have delivered them into the hand of their transgressions - abandoned them, that is, to the consequences of their wrong-doing. The allusion is, of course, to the fact recorded in Job 1:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes. Here we have again an echo of the words of Eliphaz (Job 5:8). There is a tacit assumption that Job has not had recourse to God, has not pleaded his cause with him or taken him into counsel; whereas all the evidence was the other way. Both when the first batch of calamities was reported to him (Job 1:14-19), and when the stroke of disease came (Job 2:10), Job cast his care on God, fell back on him, submitted himself to him unreservedly. \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord,\" he said in the one case; in the other, \"What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?\" And make thy supplication to the Almighty; literally, make the Almighty gracious to thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - If thou wert pure and upright. Job had asserted this, not in so many words, but substantially (Job 6:29, 30). We have God's testimony that it was true (Job 1:8; Job 2:3); not, of course, in the sense that he was absolutely free from sin, but in that qualified sense in which \"just,\" and \"righteous,\" and \"pure,\" and \"holy\" can be properly used of men. Bildad implies, without boldly asserting it, that he does not believe Job to deserve the epithets, either absolutely or in a qualified sense. If he were so, Surely now he (i.e. God) would awake for thee. This is a common anthropomorphism (see Psalm 7:6; Psalm 35:25; Psalm 44:23; Psalm 59:4, 5; Isaiah 51:9). And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous; or, make peaceful the habitation wherein thy righteousness dwelleth; i.e. make peaceful the habitation wherein thou, a righteous man ex hypothesi dwellest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Though thy beginning was small; rather, were small. Bildad does not refer to the past, but to the present. Though, if God were now to set to work to prosper Job, his beginning would be slender indeed, yet what the outcome might be none could know. God might prosper him greatly. Yet thy latter end should greatly increase. Here, once mere, Bildad does but follow in the steps of Eliphaz (see Job 5:18-26), prophesying smooth things, as be had done. It is difficult to believe that either comforter put any faith in the prospect which he held out, or imagined that Job would really be restored to prosperity. Rather there is a covert sarcasm in their words. If thou weft indeed so free from guilt as thou claimest to be, then thou wouldst be confident of a happy issue out of thy afflictions. If thou art not confident of such an issue, it is because thou art conscious of guilt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For inquire... of the former age. Put the matter to the test of experience - not the short-lived experience of living men, but the treasure of experience which has been handed down from generation to generation since the remotest times, and which is embodied in proverbs - the expression of the concentrated wisdom of antiquity. Search out and see what has in former ages been thought concerning prosperous men, like thyself, when suddenly cast down and afflicted. And prepare thyself to the search of their fathers. Go back, i.e., to the past age, but do not stop there - pursue thy researches further and further to their remote ancestors. Bildad implies that the records of these remote times have been, in some way or other, preserved, either in writings or by oral tradition. Writing was certainly known in Egypt and Babylonia from a time anterior to Abraham, and to the Hittites at a date not very much later. Books of advice and instruction embodied in proverbs, or moral precepts, were among the earliest, in Egypt certainly. See the \"Instructions of Amen-em-hat.\" in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. if. pp. 11-16, and the 'Proverbs of Aphobis,' published by the Revelation Dunbar Heath. Bildad's speech is thought to indicate \"special familiarity with Egypt.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For we are but of yesterday. \"We,\" i.e. \"of the present generation, old men though we may be, are but of yesterday; our experience is as nothing compared with the long, long experience of the past centuries, wherein the men of old \"hived wisdom with each studious year,\" not, like ourselves, hurried and pressed by the shortness of the term to which life is now reduced, but having ample time for reflection and consideration in their long lives of five, six, seven, centuries (Genesis 11:10-17), which enabled them to give their attention to everything in its turn, and to exhaust all the experiences that human life has to offer. And know nothing; i.e. comparatively. Sir Isaac Newton said that he felt like a child gathering shells upon the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay unexplored before him. Because our days upon earth are a shadow (comp. Job 14:2; Psalm 102:11; Isaiah 40:6). So brief and fleeting that they can scarcely be called a reality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart (see the comment on ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11 - Can the rush grow up without mire? The word translated \"rush\" (גמא) is that which occurs also in Exodus if. 3: Isaiah 18:2 and Isaiah 35:7, as designating a plant common in Egypt, and which is only found in these four places. It is generally admitted that the \"papyrus\" is meant \"a plant of the Cyperaceae or sedge family, which was formerly common in Egypt\" (Hooker, in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1019). The chief peculiarity of the papyrus is its triangular stem, which rises to the height of six or seven, sometimes even of thirteen or fourteen, feet, and terminates in a bunch of thread-like flowering branchlets. The pith of these stems was the material of which the ancient Egyptians made their paper. The papyrus is a water-plant, and needs an abundant supply, but would often spring up out of any small pool which the Nile left as it retired, and, when the water failed from the peel, would rapidly wither away. A fine papyrus plant was on view, with other water-plants, in the circular greenhouse in Kew Gardens, towards the end of the season of 1890. Can the flag grow without water \"The flag\" (אחוּ) seems to be the ordinary sedge, or marah-plant. Like the papyrus, it would often spring up in all its greenness from a pool or pond left by the retiring river, and then in a few days, when the water was dried up, would wither away. Both images represent the prosperity of the wicked, and were probably proverbial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not out down. It grows and flourishes in a rich greenness up to a certain point; no one touches it; but the water fails from the root, and it fades, collapses, and is gone. It withereth before any other herb. The ground may be all green around it with ordinary grass and other herbs, since they only need a little moisture - the water-plant will collapse unless it has its full supply.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - So are the paths of all that forget God. So, that is, do those proceed on their way by whom God has been forgotten, They spring up in apparent strength and lusty force; they flourish for a brief space; then, untouched by man's hand, they suddenly fade, fall, and disappear, before the mass of their contemporaries. Job is, of course, glanced at in the expression, \"all that forget God,\" though it is the last thing that he had done. And the hypocrite's hope shall perish; or, the hope of the ungodly man shall perish (comp. Job 13:16; Job 15:34; Job 17:8, where the LXX. translates by ἀσεβὴς or παράνομος).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Whose hope shall be cut off; or, break in sunder (Revised Version). Here the second metaphor begins to come in. The ungodly, who has built up around him a house, and a body of dependants and friends, is like a spider which has spun itself a magnificent web, and thinks to find a defense in it. The moment it is put to the proof it breaks in sunder;\" its delicate tracery is shattered; its fabric goes to nought. Job's house had gone to nought before his person was smitten, and, though it had once been so strong, in the hour of trial had lent him no support at all. And whose trust shall be a spider's web; literally, a spider's house. All the trust of the ungodly, in whatever it consists, shall be as fragile, as frail, as unsubstantial, as the filmy structure that a spider spins with such ears and skill, but which a wind, or a wasp, or an inconsiderate movement of its own may shatter to bits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. A spider's web, once damaged, rapidly goes to pieces. It cannot be patched up. To \"lean upon it\" is to put its structure to a test which it is unable to bear. It cannot \"stand\" or \"endure.\" The case is the same with all the supports of the ungodly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He is green before the sun. Bildad here introduces a third and more elaborate simile. The hypocrite, or ungodly man (ver. 13), is as a gourd (Jonah 4:6), or other rapidly growing plant, which shoots forth at sunrise with a wealth of greenery, spreading itself over a whole garden, and even sending forth its sprays and tendrils beyond it (comp. Genesis 49:22) - lovely to look at, and full, apparently, of life and vigour. And his branch shooteth forth in his garden; rather, over his garden, or beyond his, garden.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth (rather, he seeth) the place (literally, house) of stones. This passage is very obscure The word gal, translated heap, means sometimes a spring or stream of water (Song of Solomon 4:12); and many of the best Hebraists regard it as having that meaning here (Buxtorf, Lee, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). In this case we have to regard the rapidly growing plant as having its roots wrapped about the perennial spring, which was a not uncommon, and always a much-desired, feature of an Eastern garden. Thus nourished, it naturally increased and spread itself, and \"was green before the sun.\" May we suppose that it \"saw the house of stones,\" because the spring which nourished it gushed forth from the native rock so that its roots were in contact with both?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - If he destroy him from his place; or, if he be destroyed. The verb seems to be best taken as impersonal. If he be destroyed in any way, suddenly or gradually, by a Divine stroke, or by human agency, or by the comparatively slow process of nature, in any case the result is one, the flourishing plant is clean swept away, and the place of it knows it no more. Bildad's words are very dramatic and expressive. Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. The place shall be ashamed of having ever nurtured anything so vile, and shall declare that it never held such a growth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Behold, this is the joy of his way. Bitterly ironical - This is what his rapid and rampant greenery comes to; this is how his triumphant career ends! Utter destruction, disappearance, obliteration! And out of the earth shall others grow. The destruction leaves room for something better to follow - a sounder, healthier, and less short-lived growth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man. Bildad winds up with words of apparent trust in, and good will towards, Job. God is absolutely just, and will neither forsake the righteous man nor uphold the wicked one. If Job is, as he says, true to God, upright, and (humanly speaking) \"perfect,\" then he has only to go on trusting God; God will not leave him \"till he fill his mouth with laughing, and his lips with rejoicing\" (ver 21); then \"they that irate him shall be clothed with shame, and their dwelling-place shall come to nought' (ver. 22); but if, as we feel instinctively that Bildad believes, Job is not \"perfect,\" but \"an evil-doer,\" then he must expect no relief, no lull in his sufferings; he is obnoxious to all the threatenings which have formed the bulk of Bildad's discourse (vers. 8-20) - be may look to being cut off, like the rush and the flag (vers. 11, 12), crushed like the spider's web (ver. 14), destroyed, and forgotten, like the rapidly growing gourd (Vers. 16-19); he must look for no help from God (ver. 20); but must be contented to pass away and make room for men of a better stamp (ver. 19). Neither will he help the evil-doers; literally, neither will he grasp the hand of evil-doers; i.e. though he may support them for a while, he will not maintain them firmly and constantly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTill he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. This is very elliptical. The full phrase would be, \"God will not cast away a perfect man; therefore, if thou be such, he will not cast away thee, till he fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing,\" or \"with shouting for joy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame (comp. Psalm 35:26); and the dwelling-place (literally, tent, or tabernacle) of the wicked shall come to nought (literally, shall not be). The words are involved and obscure, because Bildad does not wish to make his meaning plain. He has to invent phrases which may cut both ways, and, while they seem directed against Job's enemies, may pain and wound Job himself.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Job.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Job answered and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-35. - Job, in answer to Bildad, admits the truth of his arguments, but declines to attempt the justification which can alone entitle him to accept the favourable side of Bildad's alternative. Man cannot absolutely justify himself before God. It is in vain to attempt to do so. The contest is too unequal. On the one side perfect wisdom and absolute strength (ver. 4); on the other, weakness, imperfection, ignorance. guilt (vers. 17-20). And no \"daysman,\" or umpire, between them; no third party to hold the balance even, and preside authoritatively over the controversy, and see that justice is done (vers. 33-35). Were it otherwise, Job would not shrink from the controversy; but he thinks it ill arguing with omnipotent power. What he seems to lack is the absolute conviction expressed by Abraham in the emphatic words'\" Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" (Genesis 18:25). Verses 1, 2. - And Job answered and said, I know it is so of a truth. \"I freely admit,\" is., \"all that has been said.\" God would not cast away a perfectly righteous man (Job 8:20); and, of course, he punishes evil-doers. But, applied practically, what is the result? How should man be just with God? or, before God? Apart from any knowledge of the doctrine of original or inherited sin, each man feels, deep in his heart, that he is sinful - \"a chief of sinners.\" Bradford looks upon the murderer as he mounts the scaffold, and says, \"But for the grace of God, there goes John Bradford!\" Job has a similar conviction, that in the sight of God, righteousness, such as it is, shrinks away into insignificance, and is as nothing, cannot anyhow be relied upon. Such must be the attitude before God of every human soul that is not puffed up with pride or utterly insensate and sunk in apathy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If he will contend with him; rather, if he should desire to contend with him; i.e. if, notwithstanding his knowledge of his own weakness and guilt, he should nevertheless be mad enough to desire to contend with God, then he will find that he cannot answer him one of a thousand. Of the charges which God might in his omniscience bring against him, he could not make a satisfactory reply to one in a thousand. It is not that Job admits any special guilt in himself; but such he feels to be the universal condition of humanity. \"All have sinned in ten thousand ways, \"and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. The sense is strengthened if we omit \"he is,\" and render, Wise in heart, and mighty in strength, who hath hardened etc.? God's combination of perfect wisdom with infinite strength renders it hopeless for any man to contend with him. Who hath hardened himself against him; and hath prospered? Job fully admits the wisdom of all that Eliphaz (Job 4:17) and Bildad (Job 8:3-6) have said, or hinted, with respect to his inability wholly to justify himself. No one has ever taken this line of absolute self-justification, and prospered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-13. - A magnificent description of the might and majesty of God, transcending anything in the Psalms, and comparable to the grandest passages of Isaiah (see especially Isaiah 40:21-24; Isaiah 43:15-20). Verse 5. - Which removeth the mountains, and they know not; which overturneth them in his anger. Earthquakes are common in all the countries adjoining Syria and Palestine, and must always have been among the most striking manifestations of God's power. There are several allusions to them in the Psalms (Psalm 8:8, 104:32). and historical mention of them in Numbers 16:32; 1 Kings 19:1; Amos 1:1; Zechariah 14:4, 5; Matthew 24:7. Josephus speaks of one which desolated Judaea in the reign of Herod the Great, and destroyed ten thousand people ('Ant. Jud.,' 15:5. § 2). There was another in 1181, which was felt over the whole of the Hauran, and did great damage. A still more violent convulsion occurred in 1837, when the area affected extended five hundred miles from north to south, and from eighty to a hundred miles east and west. Tiberias and Safed were overthrown. The earth gaped in various places, and closed again. Fearful oscillations were felt. The hot springs of Tiberias mounted up to a temperature that ordinary thermometers could not mark, and the loss of life was considerable (see the account given by Dr. Cunningham Geikie, in 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 2. pp. 317, 318). The phrases used by Job are, of course, poetical. Earthquakes do not literally \"remove\" mountains, nor \"overturn\" them. They produce fissures, elevations, depressions, and the like; but they rarely much alter local features or the general configuration of a district.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Which shaketh the earth out of her place. This is a still more startling figure of speech; but comp. Psalm 46:2; Psalm 68:16; Psalm 114:4, 6. And the pillars thereof tremble. The earth is conceived of, poetically, as a huge edifice, supported on pillars (comp. Psalm 75:3), which in an earthquake are shaken, and impart their motion to the entire building. Rosenmuller's quotation of Seneca, 'Nat. Quaest.,' 6:20 - \"Fortasse ex aliqua parle terra veluti columnis quibusdam et pills sustinetur, quibus vitiatis et recedentibus tremit pondus impositum\" - is apposite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not. A magnificent idea of God's power, and, of course, quite true. All the movements of the earth and of the heavenly bodies are movements which God causes, and could at any moment suspend. The sun only rises upon the earth each day because God causes it to rise. If he were once to intermit his hand, the whole universe would fall into confusion. And sealeth up the stars. Either covers them with a thick darkness, which their rays cannot penetrate, or otherwise renders them invisible. The idea is that God, if he pleases, can remove the stars out of man's sight, hide them away, seal them up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Which alone spreadeth out the heavens (comp. Psalm 104:2; Isaiah 40:22). The heavens are regarded as spread out over the whole earth, like a curtain or awning over a tent, everywhere overshadowing and promoting it. This \"stretching\" or \"spreading out\" is felt to be one of the mightiest and most marvellous of the Creater's works, and is constantly put forward in Scripture as a special evidence of his omnipotence (see, besides the pasages above quoted, Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:24; Isaiah 45:12; It. 13; Jeremiah 10:12). It adds to the marvellousness that God did it all \"alone,\" or \"by himself\" (comp. Isaiah 44:24). And treadeth upon the waves of the sea; literally, the heights of the sea; i.e. the waves, which run mountains-high. God plants his feet upon these, to crush them in their proud might (comp. Psalm 93:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades; literally, which maketh 'Ash Kesil and Kimah. The rendering of the LXX. (ὁ ποιῶν Πλειάδα καὶ Ἕσπερον καὶ Ἀρκτοῦρον), supported, as it is, by most of the other ancient versions and by the Targums, has caused the stellar character of these names to be generally recognized; but the exact meaning of each term is, to some extent, still a matter of dispute. On the whole, it seems most probable that 'Ash or 'Aish (Job 38:32), designates \"the Great Bear,\" called by the Arabs Nahsh while Kesil is the name of the constellation of Orion, and Kimah of that of the Pleiades. The word 'Ash means \"a litter,\" and may be compared with the Greek ἅμαξα and our own\" Charles's Wain,\" both of them names given to the Great Bear, from a fancied resemblance of its form to that of a vehicle. Kesil means \"an insolent, rich man\" (Lee); and is often translated by \"fool\" in the Book of Proverbs 14:16; Proverbs 15:20; Proverbs 19:1; Proverbs 21:20, etc. It seems to have been an epitheton usitatum of Nimrod, who, according to Oriental tradition, made war upon the gods, and was bound in the sky for his impiety - the constellation being thenceforth called \"the Giant\" (Gibbor)' or \"the insolent one' (Kesil), and later by the Greeks \"Orion\" (comp. Amos 5:8; and infra' Job 38:31). Kimah undoubtedly designates \"the Pleiades.\" It occurs again, in connection with Kesil in Job 38:31, and in Amos 5:8 The meaning is probably \"a heap,\" \"a cluster\" (Lee); which was also the Greek idea: Πλειάδες, ὅτι πλείους ὁμοοῦ κατὰ μίαν συναγωγήν (Eustath., 'Comment. in Hom. II.,' 18:488); and which has been also inimitably expressed by Tennyson in the line, \"Like a swarm of dazzling fireflies tangled in a silver braid.\" And the chambers of the south. The Chaldeans called the zodiacal constellations \"mansions of the sun\" and \"of the moon\" ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 575); but these do not seem to be here intended. Rather Job has in his mind those immense spaces of the sky which lie behind his southern horizon; how far extending, he knows not. Though the circumnavigation of Africa was not effected until about r c. 600, yet it is not improbable that he may have derived from travellers or merchants some knowledge of the Southern hemisphere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. An almost exact repetition of the words of Eliphaz in Job 5:9. The repetition may have been conscious or unconscious. Job may have meant to say, \"My view of God embraces all that you can tell me of him, and goes further;\" or he may simply have used words concerning the Divine unsearch-ableness which were common in the mouths of religious men in his time (comp. Psalm 72:18; and infra, Job 11:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not. Near as God is to us, close as he comes to us, we cannot directly see him, or feel him, or perceive his presence. We know it by faith, we may feel it in our inmost spirits; but there is no manifestation of it to our senses. A sharp line divides the visible and invisible worlds; and this line, if it is ever crossed, is very rarely crossed. Job possibly reflects upon the pretension of Eliphaz to have had a physical consciousness of the visitation of a spirit (Job 4:15, 16), and asserts, with a tinge of sarcasm, that it is otherwise with him - the spirit-worm passes him by, and he receives no light, no illumination, no miraculous direction from it. He passeth on also. The same verb is used by Eliphaz (Job 4:15) in speaking of his spiritual visitation. But I perceive him not. Eliphaz perceived the presence of the spirit (Job 4:15, 16) and heard its voice (Job 4:16-21). Job seems to mean that he is not so favoured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Behold, he taketh away; rather, he seizeth the prey (see the Revised Version). The expression is much stronger than that used in Job 1:21. Job seems to be smarting under the recollection of all that he has lost, and takes an aggrieved tone. Who can hinder him? (comp. Isaiah 45:9; Jeremiah 18:6; Romans 19:20). Who will say unto him, What doest thou? To have to do with such an irresistible Being, alone in his might, would indeed be terrible if, while absolutely powerful, unchecked and uncontrolled from without, he were not also absolutely good, and therefore controlled and checked by a law from within. This, however, Job, in his present mood, does not seem clearly to see.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. There is no \"if\" in the original; and the passage is best taken categorically: \"God does not withdraw his anger;\" i.e. the anger which he feels against those who resist him. \"The helpers of Rahab do stoop [or, 'are prostrate'] under him.\" Rahab in this passage, and also in Job 26:12, as well us in Isaiah 51:9, seems to be used as the proper name of some great power of evil Such a power was recognized in the mythology of Egypt, under the names of Set (or Typhon) and of Apophia, the great serpent, continually represented as pierced by Horus (Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 257; 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 395). In the earlier Aryan myths there is a similar personification of evil in Vitre, called Dasiya, \"the Destroyer,\" and at perpetual enmity with Indra and Agni ('Religions of the Ancient World,' p. 114). The Babylonians and Assyrians had a tradition of a great \"war in heaven\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 133-136). carried on by seven spirits, who were finally reduced to subjection. All these seem to be distorted reminiscences of that great conflict, whereof the only trustworthy account is the one contained in the Revelation of St. John, \"There was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels\" - the \"helpers\" of the present passage - \"and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven\" (Revelation 12:7, 8). Job, it seems, had inherited one of such traditions, one in which the power of evil was known as Rahab, \"the Proud One;\" and he means here to say that God not only holds men in subjection, but also beings much more powerful than man, as Rahab and his helpers, who had rebelled and made war on God, and been east down from heaven, and were now prostrate under God's feet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - How much less shall I answer him? If he be the Lord of earth and heaven, if he rule the sun and the stars, if he tread down the sea, if he be impalpable and irresistible, if he hold the evil power and his helpers under restraint, how should I dare to answer him? How should any mere man do so? And choose out my words to reason with him? Job feels that he would be too much overwhelmed to choose his terms carefully, and yet a careless word might be an unpardonable offence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer. Even perfect righteousness, so far as possible in a creature, would not enable a non to stand up in controversy with him who \"charges his angels with folly\" (Job 4:18); and, moreover, to such righteousness Job does not pretend (see Job 7:20, 21). But I would make supplication to my Judge; rather, to mine adversary (see the Revised Version). Prayer is the only rightful attitude of even the best man before his Maker - prayer for mercy, prayer for pardon prayer for grace, prayer for advance in holiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - If I had called, and he had answered me. \"If,\" that is, \"I had challenged God to a controversy, and he had granted it, and bidden me to plead my cause at his bar, yet could I not suppose that he had really hearkened to me, and would allow me boldly to stand up before him and freely to challenge his doings. Such condescension on his part, such an abnegation of his supremacy, is inconceivable, and could not have acted on it.\" Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice; rather, yet could I not believe. It was not that he would not have wished, but that he would not have been able, to believe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For he breaketh me with a tempest. \"God\" that is, \"would not be likely patiently to hear my justification, and calmly to weigh it, when he is already overwhelming me with his wrath, breaking and crushing me (comp. Genesis 3:15, where the same word שׁוּפ is used) with a very storm of calamity.\" The sentiment can scarcely be justified, since it breathes something of a contamacious spirit. But this only shows that Job was not yet\" made perfect through sufferings\" (Hebrews 2:10). And multiplieth my wounds without cause. A further assertion, not of absolute sinlessness, but of comparative innocence - of the belief that he had done nothing to deserve such a terrible punishment as he is suffering (comp. Job 6:24, 29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He will not suffer me to take my breath. \"He gives me no breathing-space,\" that is, \"no time of relaxation or refreshment. My existence is one continual. misery.\" (comp. Job 7:3-6, 13-19). But filleth me with bitterness; literally, with bitter things or bitterness (Hebrew, מַמְּר ורִים).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong. Still the idea is, \"How can I contend with God? If it is to be a trial of strength, it is he who is strong, not I; if it is to be a suit, or pleading for justice, who will appoint me a day?\" And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? (comp. below, ver 33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me. Since he could not wholly justify himself. \"All men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). Job has already admitted the utterance of \"rash words\" (Job 6:3), and, at least hypothetically, that he \"has sinned\" (Job 7:20), and needs \"pardon\" for his \"transgression\" (Job 7:24). Job, if he tried to \"justify himself,\" would have to acknowledge such shortcomings, such imperfections, such sins - at any rate, of infirmity - as would make his attempted justification a real self-condemnation. If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse; rather, even were I perfect it (i.e. my mouth) would prove me perverse; i.e. supposing I were actually perfect, and tried to prove it, my speech would be so hesitating and confused, that I should only seem to be perverse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. The original is very elliptical and very obscure. The words run, I perfect - I know not myself - I abhor my life which some explain as meaning, \"Were I perfect, I should not know it myself; I despise my life under such conditions\" (Stanley Loathes); others, \"I am perfect\" (i.e. guiltless of any plain offence), \"but do not understand myself, and care not what becomes of me\" (Canon Cook); others again, \"Were I perfect, should I not know myself, and, knowing myself, despise my own life?\" (Professor Lee). The Septuagint gives us no help, as it plainly follows a different reading. Probably our present text is a corrupt one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - This is one thing; rather, the matter is one or it is all one. There is no difference, that is, between the case of the righteous and the wicked; all are alike sinful in God's sight, all equally \"concluded under sin\" (Galatians 3:22), and all consequently obnoxious to punishment at his hands (comp. Ecclesiastes 9:2). In a certain sense the statement is true, and corresponds with the argument of Romans 1-3; but no account is taken here of God's gracious forgiveness of sin, much less of the general scheme of redemption, or the compensation for earthly sufferings in an eternity of happiness, on which the hope of the Christian rests. Therefore I said it; rather, therefore I say with the Revised Version. He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. As far as this world is concerned, it is undoubtedly true that calamities fall alike upon the just and upon the unjust. Death is the lot of all; trouble, suffering, grief, the lot of all (Job 6:7). Nor can it even be said that the wicked in this world suffer more than the good (comp. 1 Oct. 1529). Their sufferings are more the natural consequence of their actions, but do not seem to exceed in amount or severity the sufferings of the good. But this only shows that there must be a future life to redress the apparent injustice of the present one, and set the balance right.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - If the scourge slay suddenly. Such a \"scourge\" as war, or pestilence, or famine, is probably meant. If one of these be let loose upon a land, and slay, as it always does slay, indifferently the good and the bad, the innocent and the guilty, what is God's attitude? Does he interpose to save the righteous? By no means. He looks on passively, indifferently. Job even goes further, and says, with an audacity that borders on irreverence, if it does not even overstep the border, He will laugh at the trial of the innocent. St. Jerome says, \"There is nothing in the whole book harsher than this.\" It may, perhaps, be excused, partly as rhetorical, partly as needful for the full expansion of Job's argument. But it is a fearful utterance. (Professor Lee's attempt to explain the whole passage differently is scarcely a successful one.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. As a further proof of God's indifference to the sufferings of the innocent, Job adduces the fact that, in the high places of the earth, are mostly set wicked persons, who oppress and persecute the righteous. This has probably been true, in the East at any rate, at all times. He covereth the faces of the judges thereof. God covers up the eyes of those who have to judge between the oppressors and the oppressed, so that they pervert judgment, and side with the oppressors. He does this, since he permits it to be done. Corrupt judges are among the perennial curses of the East. If not, where, and who is he? rather, If it be not he who then is it? (see the Revised Version). Job argues that the established condition of things in human society must be ascribed to God, since (at least) he allows it. There is no one else to whom it can be ascribed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Now my days are swifter than a post. Life slips away so fast that before it is well begun, it is ended. Job compares it to the swift passage of the trained runner, or messenger, who carried despatches for kings and other great personages in the olden times (see 2 Chronicles 30:6; Esther 3:13; Esther 8:10, 14). Herodotus says of the trained runners employed by the Persians, \"Nothing mortal travels so fast as these Persian messengers\" (Herod., 8:98). There is abundant evidence of the employment of such persons in ancient Egypt. They flee away, they see no good. It seems to Job that his prosperity (Job 1:2-5) was only for a moment. He scarcely could look on it before it was gone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They are passed away as the swift ships; literally, like the ships of reed. The allusion is probably to the frail reed vessels of the Egyptians, of which many ancient writers speak (see Theophrastus, 'Hist. Plant.,' 4:9; Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:56; 13:11; Luean, ' Pharsalis,' 4:36, etc.). They were long, light canoes, formed generally of the papyrus plant, and propelled either by a single paddle or by a punting-pole. They were fiat-bottomed and broad, like punts, with a stem and stern rising considerably above the level of the water (see the authofs 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 507, 508). Isaiah speaks of them as \"vessels of bulrushes,\" in which \"swift messengers\" were sent by the nations peopling the banks of the Nile (Isaiah 18:1, 2). The Euphrates boats described by Herodotus (1:194) were of an entirely different construction, and cannot be here intended. They consisted of a framework of wood, which was covered with skins, and then coated with bitumen, and resembled the Welsh \"coracles.\" As the eagle that hasteth to the prey; or, as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey (Revised Version). Job's observation presents to him three types of swiftness - the trained runner upon the earth, the swift ships upon the waters, and the hungry eagle in the air. It seems to him that his life passes away as swiftly as any of these.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - If I say, I will forget my complaint (comp. above, Job 7:13). Job represents himself as sometimes, for a moment, imagining that he might put aside his load of sorrow by not thinking of it. He tries, and says to himself, \"I will forget,\" etc.; but in vain. The whole mass of his sufferings seems to rise up against him, and make even momentary forgetfulness impossible. I will leave off my heaviness; or, my black looks. And comfort myself (comp. Job 10:20 and Psalm 39:13, where the same verb is rendered \"recover strength\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - I am afraid of all my sorrows (see the comment on ver. 27). I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. The worst of all Job's sorrows is the sense of alienation from God, which his unexampled sufferings have wrought in him. Though unconscious of having deserved them, he still, not unnaturally, looks upon them as marks of God s displeasure, proofs that God does not regard him as innocent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - If I be wicked; rather, I am wicked; i.e. I am accounted so - I am already condemned. The extreme afflictions raider which I suffer indicate that God has passed sentence upon me, and awarded me my punishment. Why then labour I in vain? i.e. Why argue? Why seek to justify myself, since no result is likely to follow? Nothing that I can say will alter God's foregone conclusion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - If I wash myself with snow-water (comp. Psalm 51:7). If I should succeed in purging myself of all guilt, and establishing, so far as words can do it, my spotless innocence even then what advantage should I gain? Snow-water does not really cleanse what is defiled better than any other water, but a lively fancy might suppose it to do so. Job indulges in this fancy, but then checks himself, and adds a prosaic alternative. And make my hands never so clean; rather, and make my hands clean with lye. Lye, or potash, is the principal and most essential ingredient in soap. and the readiest and best detergent. If Job cleanses himself to the very utmost, \"Cut bone?\" he asks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch. Yet would God with ease undo his work, show his purity to be impure, his righteousness to be filthy rags, and thus, as it were, replunge him in the mire and clay from which he had sought to free himself, and hold him forth a more loathsome wretch than ever. And mine own clothes shall abhor me. So loathsome would he be that his very garments, stained and fouled by his disease, would shrink away from him and hate to touch him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; and we should come together in judgment (comp. vers. 2-14). On one of two conditions only, Job thinks, could the contest be even between himself and God.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) If God, divesting himself of all his Divine attributes, became man;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) if some thirdsman could be found, some umpire or arbitrator, to preside over the contest, and decide it. Neither condition, however, was (he thought) possible; and therefore no satisfactory judgment could take place. Recent commentators observe that the Christian scheme, which Job could not anticipate, provides almost a literal fulfilment of both conditions, since the God who is to judge us is \"true Man,\" and is also a Mediator, or \"Thirds-man,\" between us and the offended Father, with authority to make the final decision, 'the Father having committed all judgment unto the Son \"(John 5:22), and\" given him authority to execute judgment also'\" for the very reason that he is \"the Son of man\" (John 5:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Neither is there any daysman betwixt us; literally 'judge or arbitrator called a \"daysman,\" since he appoints the day on which the arbitration is to come off. The LXX. renders by μεσίτης, \"mediator.\" That might lay his hand upon us bosh. Moderate between us, that is; keep us both in cheek; assert an authority to which we must both submit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Let him take his rod away from me; rather, who would remove his rod from me. Job means that it would be a part of the duty of the \"daysman\" to see that God's rod was removed from him before he was called upon to plead, so that he might not labour under so erect a disadvantage as his sufferings would place him under. And let not his fear terrify me; or, and would not suffer his fear to terrify me; i.e. would not allow Job to be placed under the disadvantage, either of pain or of fear, either of actual or prospective suffering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJob9:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Then would I speak, and not fear him. Job has imagined conditions which are impossible (though they may, to some extent, be compensated for in the actual scheme of man's redemption); and says that, under the circumstances which he has imagined, he would not fear to justify himself before God. The assertion is over-daring, and, as Schultens says, shows the patriarch to be no longer master of himself, but carried away by the force of overwrought feeling. But it is not so with me; i.e. \"I am not in such a position as to enter on my justification.\" I am weighted by my sufferings, and also by my fears. I therefore decline the contest.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
