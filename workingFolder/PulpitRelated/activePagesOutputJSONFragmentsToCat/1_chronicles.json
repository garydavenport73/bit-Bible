"1Chr.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - No abruptness marks this narration in 1 Samuel 31. On the contrary, it is there the natural conclusion of the wars between the Philistines and Saul. This engagement took place (1 Samuel 28:4; 1 Samuel 29:1, 11) on the plains of Jezreel. The name Jezreel marks either the city (Joshua 19:18; 1 Kings 21:1, 11), or the celebrated valley or plain called in later times Esdraelon, the Greek form of the word. The plain in its largest proportions may be said to have been bounded by the Mediterranean (although it is called the plain of Accho, where it abuts on that sea) and the Jordan, and by the Samaria and Carmel ranges on the south and south-west, and those of Galilee on the north and northeast. While called a \"plain\" and \"the great plain\" in Judges 1:8, its name in the Old Testament is \"valley.\" It lay like a scalene triangle, with its apex in the direction of the Mediterranean, opening into the above-mentioned plain of Accho, and its sides going from right to left, about fifteen, twelve, and eighteen miles long respectively. The allusions to it in Old Testament history are frequent. Its exceeding richness is now turned into desolation unexceeded. Megiddo (Joshua 12:21; Judges 1:27), the city, centre of a smaller valley called by the same name (1 Chronicles 7:29; Judges 5:19), was situated within it, in the direction of Carmel. (For very full and interesting account of the Jezreel with which we have here to do, and of Esdraelon, see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 336-356, edit. 1866.) Mount Gilboa identifies for us the exact battle-field of the text. It is the same with that on which Gideon triumphed (Judges 7:1, 8). It is in the lot of Issachar, flanked by the Little Hermon ridge on the north-east, and by Gilboa on the south-east, a mountain range of ten miles long, about six hundred feet high, and mentioned only in the melancholy connection of this history. The flight of the men of Israel and of Saul was from the plain back to their position on Mount Gilboa, where they were pursued, overtaken, and slain. The modern name of the town Jezreel is Zerin, the depraved aliases of which appear as Gerin and Zazzin (Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 3:162-165, 3rd edit.), and Jezreel, Shunem, and Beth-shean are the three most conspicuous places in this part of the whole plain of Esdraelon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Followed hard after. The Hebrew verb implies all this and rather more, viz. that they made the pursuit of Saul and his sons their one special object. Luther's \"Hingen sich au Saul\" expresses this forcibly. Abinadab; or Ishui (see 1 Chronicles 8:33; 1 Samuel 14:49). The sons of Saul. Omit the article, which is not present in the Hebrew text. The fourth son, not withstanding our ver. 6, survived (2 Samuel 2:8-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The archers hit him. The literal translation would be, the shooters, men with the bow, found him. The context makes it plain that the meaning is that the arrows of the pursuers rather than the pursuers themselves \"found\" him, and these made him argue all the rest. To this our Authorized Version has jumped by the one word \"hit\" him. It is evident from ver. 8 that the Philistines did not find the body of Saul to recognize it till next day. And he was wounded of the archers. The radical meaning of the verb (חוּל) is rather \"to twist\" (torquere) or \"be twisted,\" \"writhe\" (torqueri). And the meaning here is in harmony with it, that Saul trembled from fear or writhed with the pain already inflicted of the arrows. Hence the parallel passage couples with this same verb, the adverb מְאֹך.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And abuse me. The main idea of the Hithp. of the verb here used is to satisfy the thirst of lust or cruelty. Saul probably feared not the abuse of mocking only, but that of torture. In the corresponding passage this verb is preceded by the clause, and thrust me through. His armour-bearer would not. He refused the request or bidding of Saul, no doubt mainly in respect of the fact that Saul was still \"the anointed.\" We have a full description of both the loose arms and of the armour of the body in the case of the Philistine Goliath (1 Samuel 17:4-7). It is one of the world's surprising facts that the making of arms and armour, and the acquiring of skill in the using of them, should, as in fact all history attests, date from so early a period (Genesis 31:26; Genesis 34:25). As compared with the history and the fragmentary re. mains of classical antiquity, those of Scripture are remarkably scanty on this subject. The sword is the earliest mentioned in Scripture, carried in a sheath (1 Samuel 17:51; 2 Samuel 20:8; 1 Chronicles 21:27); though the Hebrew word is here different from that used in Samuel. It was slung by a girdle (1 Samuel 25:13), rested on hips or thigh (2 Samuel 20:8; Judges 3:16; Psalm 45:3), and was sometimes \"two-edged\" (Judges 3:16; Psalm 149:6). Then follows the spear in several varieties, as in 1 Samuel 17:7; 1 Chronicles 11:11; 1 Chronicles 20:5; 1 Chronicles 23:9. Again as a javelin (Joshua 8:14-25; Job 29:23; 1 Samuel 17:6, where in the Authorized Version it is called target, or gorget). Again as a lancet (1 Kings 18:28; 1 Chronicles 12:8, 24; 2 Chronicles 11:12; Nehemiah 4:13; Ezekiel 39:9). In addition to these three chief varieties of spear - the spear proper, the javelin, end the lancet - there is mention of two other weapons used at all events as the dart of a light kind would be used, in 2 Chronicles 23:10, and elsewhere, and in 2 Samuel 8:14, respectively. After sword and spear rank the bow and arrow (Genesis 21:20; 1 Samuel 31:3; 1 Chronicles 8:40; 1 Chronicles 12:2; Psalm 68:9; Psalm 120:4; Job 6:4) And lastly, the sling (Judges 20:16; 1 Samuel 25:29; 2 Kings 3:25), and a very strong weapon of the same kind mentioned in 2 Chronicles 26:15. The chief articles worn as bodily armour were the breastplate (1 Samuel 17:5, 38); the somewhat obscure habergeon, mentioned only twice, in no connection then of battle (Exodus 28:32; Exodus 39:23), the original name of which, tacharah, is found on Egyptian papyri of the nineteenth dynasty, - it seems to have been a species of doublet or corselet; the helmet (1 Samuel 17:5; ch. 26:14; Ezekiel 27:10); greaves (1 Samuel 17:6); two kinds of shield (1 Samuel 17:7, 41, compared with 1 Kings 10:16; 2 Chronicles 9:15); and lastly the article mentioned in 2 Samuel 8:7; 1 Chronicles 18:7; 2 Kings 11:10; 2 Chronicles 23:9; Song of Solomon 4:4; Jeremiah 51:11; Ezekiel 27:11; and of which we can say nothing certainly bearing upon its nature or its use, except that it was made of gold. Armour-bearers, then, the first distinct mention of whom we find in Judges 9:54, may well have been a necessity for kings and for the great. Joab had ten (2 Samuel 18:15). The word is not expressed as a compound in Hebrew, but as \"one carrying (כֵלַים) arms.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And died. The parallel (1 Samuel 31:5) adds \"with him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - All his house. In place of these words, the parallel (1 Samuel 31:6) has, \"And his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.\" This reading avoids the ambiguity referred to already (ver. 2). In either passage the moral is plain, that the end and ruin of Saul's family as a whole had arrived, rather than literally that the whole, including every member, of that family had perished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In the valley. In place of these words, the parallel (1 Samuel 31:7) has, \"On the other side of the valley, and.., on the other side Jordan.\" We have here a clear instance of the desire of the compiler of Chronicles to compress his narrative, while the fidelity of the parallel narrative is testi-fled in the naturalness of its statements, amounting to this, that, quick as the intelligence or report could reach all those Israelites who were at all within the range of the victorious Philistines, they hastened to vacate their abodes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And his sons. The parallel (1 Samuel 31:8) says explicitly, \"And his three sons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour. Some comparing this with the parallel (1 Samuel 31:9), \"They cut off his head, and stripped off his armour,\" say \"our author\" leaves the beheading unmentioned! It is certainly sufficiently implied. To carry tidings unto their idols. This sentence is more clearly explained, and brought into rather unexpected and perhaps unwished accord with the most modern of our ecclesiastical habits, when in the parallel as above, we find \"to publish it in the house of their idols \"as the form of expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The house of their gods. In place of this general designation, the parallel (1 Samuel 31:10) designates the house more exactly as \"the house of Ashtaroth\" (Genesis 14:5; the Phoenician female deity, as Baal was their male deity. The Greek form of the name is Astarte. See also Cic., 'De. Nat. Deo.,' 3:23). And fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. The parallel, as above, gives us, \"And fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shah\" (which account is corroborated in 2 Samuel 21:12-14), and does not say what further was done with the head. It is no doubt remarkable that one historian puts on record the one fact and the other the other; and it is one of the clearer indications that both took from some common sources. It is perhaps something to be remarked also that, while the historian in Samuel says nothing further about the head (though allusion to it is probably included in the \"body\" and the \"bones,\" the further account of which is given in vers. 12, 13, as well as in 2 Samuel 21:12-14), the compiler of Chronicles does revert to mention of \"the body of Saul,\" ver. 12, infra, though without any corresponding naming of Beth-shah. Bertheau finds little difficulty in the question, by simply supposing that the omission in Chronicles is another instance of the desire to compress; while others suppose corruption in our text, or, as Thenius and Ewald, the loss of a sentence to our text. After all said, the omission in Samuel of the fate of the head would seem to be fully as remarkable as the omission, so far as this verse is concerned, in Chronicles of the fate of the body. It is reasonable to suppose that the head and trunk of the body of Saul were brought together again, or it were likely some allusion to the contrary would have transpired in the following verses of this chapter or in 2 Samuel 21:12-14. With regard to the act of the Philistines in dedicating the armour of Saul, and fixing his head in the temple of Dagon, as though trophies, the custom was both ancient and not uncommon (Judges 16:21-30; 1 Samuel 5:1-5; 1 Samuel 21:9). The house of Dagon (Joshua 15:41; Joshua 19:27) here spoken of was that at Ashdod (Joshua 15:47), between Gaza and Joppa. Though belonging to Judah's lot, it was never subdued by Israel, and remained throughout their history one of their worst foes. It is the Azotus of Acts 8:40. There was another Dagon temple at Gaza (Judges 16:21-31). Dagon's representation was the figure of a man, as to head, hands, and bust, but for the rest that of a fish, which was a symbol of fruitfulness. As Ashdod was situate on the extreme west of Palestine, so Beth-shah - generally written Beth-shean, a city of Manasseh (ch. 7:29), though within the borders of Issachar (Joshua 17:11), flora which the Canaanites were not expelled (Judges 1:27) - was on the extreme east near the Jordan. It was afterwards called Scythopolis. Considering the distance these were apart, and their contrary directions, we may suppose that some suggestion was intended by the fixing the head in the one place and the body in the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Jabesh. This is the only place where \"Jabesh\" is used as an abbreviation for Jabesh-gilead, of which it was the chief city. Gilead comprised the lots of Reuben and Gad (Numbers 32:1-5, 25-32, 39-41) and of half Manasseh (1 Chronicles 27:21). Saul had on a celebrated occasion (1 Samuel 11:1-13) befriended the people of Jabesh-gilead, coming to their rescue against Nahath the Ammonite, of which kindness they are now mindful, show that rarest of virtues, gratitude to a fallen monarch, and are further on (2 Samuel 2:5) commended for it by David. This verse does not tell us, as the parallel (1 Samuel 31:12) does, of the first burning of the bodies, and then of the burying of the calcined bones. The silence is very remarkable. It does name the kind of tree, the \"oak\" or \"terebinth.\" The word for the tree, however, in both passages is of doubtful and perhaps only generic signification. The several Hebrew words translated in various places as \"oak,\" all share a common root, significant of the idea of strength. Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 243, 244) says that the country owns still to an abundance of oaks of very fine growth in some cases, and that these are exceedingly more plentiful and altogether a stronger tree than the \"terebinth.\" The different names, though all connected with one root, referred to are probably owing to the large variety of oaks. With the statement of the burying of the bones under a tree, and the fasting of seven days on the part of these brave and grateful men of Jabesh-gilead, the parallel account comes to its end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - So Saul died for his transgression. (For this transgression and the stress laid upon it and its predicted consequences, see 1 Samuel 15:1-9, 11, 14; 1 Samuel 28:18.) For asking... of... a familiar spirit (1 Samuel 28:7-24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And inquired not of the Lord. Saul seems to have, in point of fact, inquired in some sense (1 Samuel 14:37; 1 Samuel 28:5, 6, 15). But the probable meaning is that he did not inquire in the first instance (see vers. 3, 4); and when he did inquire, he did not await the reply solely and exclusively of Jehovah. Therefore he slew him (so see 1 Chronicles 2:3). David the son of Jesse. The compiler, having heretofore given so scrupulously whatever of genealogical fact he could, is now careful to use it. And he identifies the future chief hero of his history as him who had already been instanced (1 Chronicles 2:15), \"son of Jesse.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Upon the death of Saul, Abner, for a while espousing the cause of Ishbo-sheth, the only surviving son of Saul, \"made him king over\" a large proportion of the people, exclusive of Judah (2 Samuel 2:8-10). Already David had been anointed at Hebron by \"the men of Judah, king over the house of Judah\" (2 Samuel 2:1-4). And David continued \"king in Hebron over the house of Judah seven years and six months\" (2 Samuel 2:11; 2 Samuel 5:5; 1 Kings 2:11; 1 Chronicles 3:4). Notice the agreement of this date with the account of the six sons born to David in Hebron (2 Samuel 3:2-5). The explanation of the chronology for Ishbosheth affecting this period is not easy. It is said that he reigned over Israel \"two years\" (2 Samuel 2:10). Where was the difference of five and a half years lost? Our first verse here, with its apparently emphatic then (comp. 2 Samuel 5:1), would seem to make it very unlikely that it was lost between the death of Ishbosheth and the kingship of David over \"all the tribes of Israel\" together with Judah. On the other hand, the interval in question might find its account in the \"long war (2 Samuel 3:1, 6, 17-21) between the house of Saul and the house of David.\" There is, however, still possible the supposition that the historian intends to give the intrinsically correct facts of the case, and means that, what with delay before getting the adhesion of the people to Ishbosheth, and what with the early decay of his sovereign power, he could not be said to have reigned more than two years. This verse, then, shows that the history proper of Chronicles purports to begin from the time of David's rule over the entire and united people, at the exact date of seven and a half years after Saul's death, while no mention is here made of his intermediate partial rule over Judah, or of Ishbosheth's temporary rule over Benjamin and Israel. All Israel; i.e. \"all the tribes of Israel\" (2 Samuel 5:1), by their representatives, \"the elders of Israel\" (2 Samuel 3:17; 2 Samuel 5:3; as well as our ver. 3). The first nine verses of this chapter cover the same ground as the first ten verses of 2 Samuel 5. Unto Hebron. We learn how David came to be here from 2 Samuel 2:1. \"And it came to pass after this\" (i.e. after David's \"lamentation over Saul and Jonathan\") \"that David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.\" Hebron was the \"earliest seat of civilized life, not of Judah only, but of all Palestine.\" It and Bethlehem are two of the most special memorials of David. An interesting sketch of the topography and natural features of this place, and a succinct Biblical history of it in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 164 (edit. 1866), from which comes the following quotation: - \"Hebron, according to the Jewish tradition, was the primeval city of the vine. Its name indicates community or society. It was the ancient city of Ephron the Hittite, in whose gate he and the elders received the offer of Abraham, when as yet no other fixed habitation of man was known in central Palestine. It was the first home of Abraham and the patriarchs; their own permanent resting-place when they were gradually exchanging the pastoral for the agricultural life. In its neighbourhood can be traced, by a continuous tradition, the site of the venerable tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and of the double cavern in which he and his family were deposited and perhaps still remain. It was the city of Arba, the old Canaanite chief, with his three giant sons, under whose walls the trembling spies stole through the land by the adjacent valley of Eshcoh Here Caleb chose his portion when, at the head of his valiant tribe, he drove out the old inhabitants, and called the whole surrounding territory after his own name; and here the tribe of Judah always rallied, when it asserted its independent existence against the rest of the Israelite nation. It needs but few words to give the secret of this early selection, of this long continuance of the metropolitan city of Judah. Every traveller from the desert must have been struck by the sight of that pleasant vale, with its orchards and vineyards and numberless wells, and we must add, in earlier times, the groves of terebinths and oaks which then attracted from far the eye of the wandering tribes. This fertility was in part owing to its elevation into the cooler and the more watered region above the dry and withered valleys of the rest of Judaea - and commanding this fertile valley, rose Hebron, on its crested hill.\" Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. This is a figurative expression, the pedigree and lineage of which it is interesting to note (see 2 Samuel 19:12; Judges 9:2; Genesis 29:14; Genesis 2:23). The highest service to which it was promoted may be said to be reached, however, in Ephesians 5:30.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou shalt feed my people Israel (so 2 Samuel 5:2; 2 Samuel 7:7; Psalm 78:71). Thus to the servant is condescendingly vouchsafed the same description as the Master takes through the Spirit for himself - to the under-shepherd the same as the Chief Shepherd acknowledges; note same psalm, ver. 72; Psalm 23:1-4; Psalm 100:3; 1 Peter 5:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Made a covenant... before the Lord. A forcible use of this phrase occurs in Judges 11:11. It implies that the engagement was ratified in the presence of a holy place, a holy vessel of the sanctuary, or a holy person (1 Samuel 21:6, 7; Joshua 18:8; Leviticus 1:5). Whether the tabernacle was now at Hebron is doubtful, but the two priests, Abiathar and Zadok, were. They anointed David. The first time of David's being anointed (l 1 Samuel 16:1, 13) Samuel the prophet officiated. The second time (2 Samuel 2:4) was when the \"men of Judah\" anointed him king over \"the house of Judah.\" This third time when David was anointed king over the united people, it was at all events at the special instance of \"all the elders of Israel,\" although who officiated on these two last occasions is not mentioned. According to the word of the Lord by Samuel. The sentence marks the complete fulfilment of what had been foreshadowed in 1 Samuel 16:12, 13; and it may probably have been the more carefully introduced by the compiler of Chronicles, in consideration of the absence from his own work of previous details and of the previous anointings of David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Jerusalem, which is Jebus. This ancient name of Jerusalem, of Canaanitish date, is found only once beside, viz. in Judges 19:10, 11; the Gentile form of the noun, however, Jebusi, is of more frequent occurrence, and sometimes it is found even as the name of the city (Joshua 15:8, 63; Joshua 18:16, 28). The derivation and meaning of the word are unascertained. Gesenius explains it to mean \"a place dry or downtrodden like a threshing-floor.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5 - Thou shalt not come hither. The inhabitants of Jebus added something beside (2 Samuel 5:6). They had said, \"Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.\" The castle of Zion. This fort became the site of the temple. It is the Acra of Josephus, and is different from the modern Zion. It was the eastern hill in the city, was the second highest elevation in the city, and up to the time of the destruction of the city of Jerusalem was uniformly named Zion, though from the time of Constantine it has been used for the name of the western hill, the site of Jerusalem. There is but little doubt of the identity of the hill of Moriah with the hill of Zion, though no individual passage of Scripture asserts it. The passage before us, however, with its parallel, tells us plainly enough that the city of David, and that which became the sacred hill of Zion are one; and many passages in the Psalms and the prophets both confirm this and point out the difference between Zion and Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The name and fresh glory of Joab, as given here, are not given in 2 Samuel 5:3-10; and we could suppose that they were purposely withheld there. It is true that Joab already held high office, probably the first place as captain of David's men, but Bertheau's objection to the statements of this verse on such grounds easily yields to the considerations - first, that there can be no doubt Joab had fallen into disfavour with David and others, upon his slaying of Abner (2 Samuel 3:26-29, 36, 37); and further, that this was a great occasion, exceedingly favourable for evoking any very special ability of younger or unknown men, at present lost under the shadow of larger growths. The advantage which Joab gained now was one that confirmed his position and increased largely his influence; and an indication that he was not slow to avail himself of it is probably to be traced in the eighth verse, where it is said while \"David built... even from Millo round about,... Joab repaired the rest of the city.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Millo. There is great uncertainty as to the derivation and the meaning of this word. It is probably not really of Hebrew extraction, but of the oldest Canaanitish origin. In the Hebrew it is always used with the article, and would presumably come from the Hebrew root \"to fill.\" Josephus seems to use, as synonymous expression for \"David's wall round Millo,\" this, viz. \"buildings round about the lower city\" ('Jud. Ant.,' 3:2, compared with 5; 'Wars,' 6:1, where he identifies those \"buildings,\" etc., with Acra). As the name of a family, it is mentioned in connection with Shechem, known specially as a place of the Canaanites (Judges 9:6, 20). The Septuagint represents it by the word ἡ α}κρα. In the remarkable passage, 2 Kings 12:20, the word \"Silla\" is even a greater enigma, which, however, may designate the \"steps from the city of David\" (Nehemiah 3:15), or \"the causeway of going up\" to the west of the temple (1 Chronicles 22:16). The likeliest view of Mille is that it was a very strong point of fortification in the surrounding defences of the hill of Zion (1 Kings 9:24; 1 Kings 11:27). In 2 Chronicles 32:5 the otherwise unvarying translation (ἡ α}κρα) of the Septuagint is superseded by τὸ ἀνάλημμα, a word itself of doubtful signification. For while some would render it by the word \"foundation,\" Schleusner translates it \"height.\" Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:367) puts it in \"the neighbourhood of the Tyropaean valley at the foot of Zion.\" Some clue may lie in the word \"inward,\" applied to the building by David. Does it imply a covering by edifices of the space, or some portion of it, that lay between Zion and the rest of the city? (See also Keil on Kings, vol. 2:163.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-25. - This list of chiefs of David's \"mighty men' finds a more appropriate position where it is placed here, than where it is found, after the close of the very dying speech of David, in 2 Samuel 23:8-23. It plainly belongs to the time of the establishment of David's sway over the whole people. The different position of the list here is itself an indication of some force, that the writers of the work of Samuel and of Chronicles availed them- selves independently of the common source, and that the latter did not take through the former.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - This is the number. The Hebrew has,\" These are the number.\" The sentence should probably be, \"These are the names\" (2 Samuel 23:8). Jashobeam. In the parallel passage, this name is supplied by the words \"The Tachmonite ישֵׁב בַּשֶּׁבָת, Authorized Version, \"that sat in the seat\" (see the previous verse), probably in error for our יָשָׁבְעָם (see Kennicott's 'Dissert.,' 82). His immediate paternal ancestor seems to have been Zabdiel (1 Chronicles 27:2). The only other notices of him are in 1 Chronicles 12:6; 1 Chronicles 27:2, in which latter passage he is mentioned as \"over the first course for the first month and in his course were twenty and four thousand.\" The chief of the captains. The Authorized Version follows the Keri (which is distinguished from the Chethiv by a yod in place of a vau), and translates captains. It seems better (vers. 15, 25; 1 Chronicles 12:1, 18; 1 Chronicles 27:6) to abide by the Chethiv, and translate \"the chief of the thirty.\" He lifted up his spear. Notice the probable error in Samuel, occasioned by some similarity in the Hebrew letters. \"The same was Adino the Eznite.\" The number of Jashobeam's victims is stated at \"eight hundred\" in the parallel passage (2 Samuel 23:8). (For analogous idioms, see Exodus 7:20; Exodus 20:25; Deuteronomy 27:5; Joshua 8:31; Psalm 41:9; Psalm 74:5; Isaiah 2:4; Ezekiel 26:28.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Eleazar. Perhaps the same as Azareel in the list at 1 Chronicles 12:6, in which Jashobeam is also found. Dodo. This name is found in three forms, the Chethiv being Dodi; the Keri, Dodo; and Dodai being found in 1 Chronicles 27:4. He is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 27:4 as \"over the course of the second month... in his course likewise twenty and four thousand.\" The Ahohite. In the parallel passage (2 Samuel 23:9), for הָאְחַוחִי here, we find בֶןאּאֲחוחִי. Ahohite is the patronymic of the Ahoah, who (1 Chronicles 8:4) was given among the sons of Bela, the firstborn of Benjamin. The three mighties. Who is the third? We have here but two - Jashobeam and Eleazar. The parallel passage supplies the omission by the name of Shammah the Hararite (2 Samuel 23:11, 33; comp. our ver. 27). And a careful comparison of the passages suggests how the omission came about, and that it was but part of a larger omission. Between the sentences, \"and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle,\" and \"where was a parcel of ground full of barley\" (in our next verse, 13) there is an hiatus of two verses (viz. those found in 2 Samuel 23, as latter half of ver. 9, ver. 10, and former half of ver. 11), and this hiatus was occasioned probably by the recurrence of the expression,\" and the Philistines were gathered together,\" in the remaining half of ver. 11 (see Kennicott's Bible, and 'Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Pas-dammim. This word, הַפַּס דַּמִּים, appears in 1 Samuel 17:1 as אֶפֶס דַּמִּים, and is supposed to mean, in either form, \"the boundary of blood;\" it was the scene of frequent conflicts with the Philistines, and was the spot where they were encamped at the time of Goliath's challenge to Israel. It was near Shocoh, or Soech, in Judah, some fourteen miles south-west of Jerusalem. Full of barley. The Authorized Version reading in the parallel passage (2 Samuel 23:11) is \"full of lentiles,\" the Hebrew for \"barley\" is שְׂעורִים, for \"lentiles\" עֲדָשִׁים. Possibly the words should be the same, one being here spelt, by accident, wrongly for the other (so Kennicott). The first Bible mention of \"barley\" occurs in Exodus 9:31, 32, from which verses we learn that it, together with \"flax,\" was an earlier crop than \"rye\" and \"wheat.\" It was not only used for food for man (Numbers 5:15; Judges 7:13; Ezekiel 4:12), but also for horses (1 Kings 4:28). That it was nevertheless of the less-valued grain, we have significant indications, in its being prescribed for the \"jealousy offering\" (Numbers 5:15, comp. with Leviticus 2:1), and in its being part of the purchase price of the adulteress (Hosea 3:2). Its derivation in the Hebrew, from a verbal root signifying \"to bristle,\" is in noticeable analogy with the Latin hordeum, from horreo. Gesenius's observation, that the singular of the word given above in the Hebrew marks the \"growing crop,\" and the plural the \"grain\" itself, seems hardly corroborated by this single passage at all events. The lentile, on the other hand, was a species of bean, and used much for soup, of which Egyptian tomb-paintings furnish illustration (Genesis 25:29-34; 2 Samuel 17:28; Ezekiel 4:9). Sonnini, in his 'Travels' (translation of Hunter, 3:288), tells us that still the Egyptian poor eat lentile-bread, but, what is more apropos of this passage, that in making it they prefer to mix a little \"barley\" with it. This apparent discrepancy between the parallel accounts not only counts in itself for very little, but may easily be surmounted by supposing that, though it be written that the \"parcel\" of ground was \"full of lentiles,\" and again \"full of barley,\" the description may only amount to this, that such parcels were in close juxtaposition. But if not, our allusion above to the possible error in the Hebrew words will sufficiently explain the variation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This, as well as the latter half of the preceding verse, belongs to the account of Shammah the Hararite (2 Samuel 23:11), and in the parallel the verbs are accordingly in the singular number. In that same place Shammah is called the \"son of Agee,\" which probably answers to the \"Shage\" of the present chapter (ver. 34), where our reading should rather be, \"Jonathan the son of Shammah the son of Shage, the Hararite.\" The word \"Hararite\" designates, according to Gesenius, \"one from the hill-country,\" i.e. the hill-country of Judah or Ephraim, and would be equivalent with us to such a description as \"the mountaineer.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Three of the thirty. The thirty here alluded to have not been mentioned either in the Book of Samuel or here, except by implication of our ver. 11, where we might imagine the sense to be, \"Now these are the names of the mighty men, in number thirty, whom David had, viz. Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty.\" Nor are we told in either place who were the \"three\" here spoken cf. The article is absent in both places, or it would be convenient and natural to suppose that the three just mentioned are those intended, which cannot, however, be taken for granted. The language of vers. 20-22, 25, might rather indicate that the three mentioned in those verses are those in question. The repeated uncertainty in which we are left on matters to which no intrinsic difficulty adheres seems evidence of injured manuscripts rather than of anything else. To the rock to David. This is the right reading, עֵל־חֵצֻּר אֶל־דָּוִד; and that in the parallel passage (\"to David in the harvest-time\") is not correct, אֶל־קָצִיר אֶל־דָּוִד. The cave of Adullam. Adullam, evidently a place of great antiquity (Genesis 38:l, 12, 20), is mentioned in Joshua 12:15; Joshua 15:35; it was the seat then of a Canaanite king. It afterwards lay in Judah, in that lowland (called often the Shephelah) that ran from Joppa to Gaza, near the Mediterranean Sea. It kept name and fame to the last (2 Chronicles 11:7; Nehemiah 11:30). The \"rock\" marks the limestone cliffs of the region (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 254-259, edit. 1866). We read of it, as David's refuge (1 Samuel 22:1, 2). From our present passage, and its parallel we should have concluded that it could not have been far from Bethlehem. In this sense Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607) refers to the tradition that fixes the cave at a spot now called Khureitun, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, and says, \"Leaving our horses in charge of wild Arabs, and taking one Arab for a guide, we started for the cave, having a fearful gorge below, gigantic cliffs above, and the path winding along a shelf of the rock, narrow enough to make the nervous among us shudder. At length from a great rock, hanging on the edge of this shelf, we sprang by a long leap into a low window, which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the hold of David, and creeping half-doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had Lime to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lion-hearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance, and would not even have attempted it.\" The host. For this word \"host\" (מַחֲגֵה) the parallel (2 Samuel 23:13) has the \"life of the Philistines\" (but the Authorized Version, the \"troop of\"), i.e. the beasts and cattle of the Philistines. So also the Syriac Version translates, The Septuagint shows in this place παρεμβολή, and in Samuel τὰγμα. The valley of Rephaim. The situation of this notable valley is not certain. Yet there can be little doubt, in spite of Furst ('Handwortbuch,' 2:383), who supposes a situation north-west of Jerusalem, that it must be near Bethlehem, and therefore south-west of the city. The word employed Here for \"valley\" (עִמֶק should mark an enclosed one. Rephaim means \"giants.\" Hence our Authorized Version, \"The valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward\" (Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:16; also 2 Samuel 5:18; comp. with our present passage; and 2 Samuel 5:22 comp. with 1 Chronicles 14:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - David was then in the hold. This statement may, perhaps, sufficiently identify this occasion with that of 2 Samuel 5:17, 18; where it is expressly said that \"David went down to the hold\" (מְצוּדָה being the word found there as here). Garrison. The Hebrew here says \"officer\" (נְצִיב), but the parallel passage has \"garrison\" (מַצָּב); yet, according to Gesenius ('Thes.,' 903), the former word has both meanings. He is right, certainly, if he means that it has received both translations, for see 1 Kings 4:19 for the one, and our present passage supplies the other (1 Samuel 10:5; 1 Samuel 13:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The well of Bethlehem... at the gate. Nothing else is known of this well. No trace of it exists now, according to Dr. Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 1:473). The traditional well is half a mile distant, to the north of the town, and consists of a group of three cisterns, while the present town is supplied with water by an aqueduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - David... poured it out to the Lord. This was done after the nature of a libation (1 Samuel 7:6; Judges 6:20; Exodus 30:9; Genesis 35:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - My God forbid it me. Compare the Hebrew of this with that of the expression in the parallel (2 Samuel 23:17), where יְהוָה is found in the place of our מֵךאלֹהַי. It is probable that the preposition nieni is lost from before \"Jehovah.\" Shall I drink the blood, etc.? i.e. the water which has been obtained at the imminent peril of the life of these three brave men (comp. Genesis 4:10, 11; Genesis 9:4-6; John 6:53, 54).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Abishai... was chief of the three. It is remarkable that again the name of one of the three is wanting, even if we take Benaiah of ver. 22 for the second.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Than the two. The Hebrew (בַשְׁנַיִס) cannot be thus translated, but possibly the words may mark the second set of three.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBenaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Benaiah, His father Jehoiada was chief priest (1 Chronicles 27:5). Benaiah was, therefore, a Levite by tribe, though Kabzeel (Joshua 15:21) was in Judah far south. He was \"captain of the host for the third month... and in his course were twenty and four thousand\" (1 Chronicles 27:5). When in our ver. 25 it is said that \"David set him over his guard,\" the allusion probably is to his uniform and prolonged command of \"the Cherethites and Pelethites\" (2 Samuel 8:18; 2 Samuel 20:23; 1 Kings 1:38; 1 Chronicles 18:17). His fidelity and influence remained into Solomon's time (1 Kings 1:8, 10, 32, 38, 44; 1 Kings 2:35; 1 Kings 4:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Five cubits high. This height is not given in the parallel passage; it means seven feet six inches. A spear like a weaver's beam (so 1 Samuel 17:7; 2 Samuel 21:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The name.

If the reference is not as above (see ver. 22), the margin of the parallel (2 Samuel 23:23) may be followed, which would translate \"guard\" as council. This Gesenius adopts, and translates \"privy council.\" There seems, however, no necessity for this, with the references before us above given (2 Samuel 8:18, etc., to which may be added ch. 27:6, which shows Benaiah to be captain of the third division).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-41. - These verses correspond with vers. 24-39 in 2 Samuel 23, and with them the subject ends there, though not here. The list announced here as comprising \"the valiant men of the armies,\" is unannounced there, but, beginning with the same name, Asahel, it calls him \"one of the thirty,\" and suggests the inference that those who follow will make up the rest. The number that follows (coinciding in this respect strictly with our list here) is itself thirty, which, though one too many, may be considered satisfactorily accounted for in the fact of the untimely death of Asahel, already recorded (2 Samuel 2:23). Considering the exact crisis at which he died, it is very likely that his place should be compensated for, although his name were unremoved from the honourable list. Amid the difficulties that develop themselves in the contents of these lists, when compared, the comparison of them aids the conviction that, so far as they go together, they do stand for \"the thirty\" spoken of in both places, and that a sentence or two here and there, now lost or corrupted beyond recognition, would clear up the whole subject. The comparison also seems to make it clear that the compiler of Chronicles, meaning to go beyond an enumeration of the thirty, nowhere speaks of thirty after ver. 25. On the other hand, the writer of the account in Samuel carefully sums up all (ver. 39) in the words, \"thirty and seven in all \" - an addition which means either the actual thirty-one given and the two sets of three each; or the thirty, with the two sets of three each and Joab ever all. Our present chapter, however, goes on to the number forty-eight in all, vers. 41-47, adding sixteen to the thirty-two which precede. Beside some minor differences, it must be said that at fewest three names, Hepher, Ahijah, and Mibhar, in Chronicles, resist identification with those that should (from position) correspond with them in the list of Samuel and with any others. And the same thing may be said of the same number in the list of Samuel (Elika, Eliam, Bani) when compared with the list now before us. The points of contact and clearest identification are, therefore, in so great a majority and are so uniformly distributed that, although it is left hard to decide the causes of them, these differences cannot throw any discredit upon the list as a whole. Perhaps the most probable suggestion to be offered is that the knowledge of the writer of the Book of Samuel enabled him to supersede the names of such as were soon lost to their brave career by death by other names; or, resting on the same fundamental reason, there may have been two different editions of the list, to one of which the writer of Samuel was indebted, and to the other the compiler of Chronicles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Harorite. The parallel passage has Harodite, the local identification of Shammoth, as from Hated, known for its spring (Judges 7:1), by which Gideon encamped, where also the army was tested by its mode of drinking. Some think it the same with the fountain of Jezreel (1 Samuel 29:1). Izrahite seems to have been the family distinction of Shammoth (1 Chronicles 27:8), from Zerah son of Judah. He is the fifth captain. In the parallel his name is followed by Elika, who is also called \"the Harodite.\" Helez the Pelonite. Though the parallel place has Paltite, the present form probably should hold its own. Helez is the seventh captain of division, and said to belong to the \"sons of Ephraim\" (see 1 Chronicles 27:10, and Septuagint in all three passages).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIra the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Sibbecai; Ilai. Both of these names are conceivably reconcilable with the Mebunnai and Zalmon of the parallel place, through the very possible mistake and substitution of one Hebrew character for another. Sibbecai was the eighth captain; he was of the family of Zerah, and of the town of Hushah (1 Chronicles 4:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMaharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIthai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAzmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The sons of Heshem the Gizonite. This sentence is unmanageable as it stands, and is insufficiently assisted from its parallel But if from this latter we take the suggestion of the preposition \"from\" (Authorized Version) before \"the sons\" (which, however, is not in the Hebrew), and from the Alexandrian Septuagint, the suggestion of the name Gouni (גּוּנִי), Guni, (1 Chronicles 5:15) in the place of Gizonite (גּוזנִי), we should obtain a coherent reading. But this would be mere conjecture suggested by the Septuagint, and \"the Gizonite\" offers the difficulty of the presence of the article, which would not subsist with the proper name Guni. Were it not that the word בְּנֵי is found in both passages all difficulty would disappear with its disappearance. The remainder of this verse, in relation to vers. 32 and 33 of the parallel, illustrates opportunely the uncertainties of the text. For, as seen above, Jonathan is the grandson of Shage (Agee, 2 Samuel 23:11), and son of Shammah, while (2 Chronicles 23:32, 33) the parallel reads \"Jonathan,\" with no connective word \"son\" at all, yet supplies the right name, \"Shammah the Hararite\" for the father, and omits all mention of Shage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAhiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Sacar...

Although this name is not found in the parallel passage, it is tolerably plain that the niche for it is left before the words (ver. 34), \"the son of the Maachathite,\" which last word answers to our Mecherathite. Ahijah the Pelonite. This name cannot be identified with the \"Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,\" which answers to it in the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Hezro appears as Hezrai in Samuel. (For Carmel, which lay south of Hebron, see Joshua 15:55.) Naarai the son of Ezbai. The differences between these words and those of the parallel (ver. 35), \"Paarai the Arbite,\" or Arab (Joshua 15:52), are not formidable to reconcile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJoel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Joel. This name is also easily to be reconciled with the Igal of the parallel passage (ver. 36), though there is nothing to evidence which should stand. Mibhar the son of Haggeri. For this we have in the parallel place (ver. 36) the names \"Bani the Gadite;\" but before these comes the last word of the previous clause, \"of Zobab.\" When these three words are compared with the three of our present passage, it is very possible to bring them into harmony ('Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.). Zobah was a district of Syria in the time of Israel's first three kings, stretching north-east and east towards the Euphrates (1 Samuel 14:47; 2 Samuel 8:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTZelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Zelek the Ammonite,... the Berothite. Among David's great men were evidently numbered some foreigners, whose admiration and fidelity he must have won. Hence the mention (ver. 38) of Zobah, and here of the Ammonite (2 Samuel 8:12; 2 Samuel 12:26-31), the Beerothite (Beeroth, originally a Hivite city, Joshua 9:17, fell to the lot of Benjamin, Joshua 18:25; to it belonging Rimmon and his two sons, Reehab and Baanah, possibly native Canaanites, the murderers of Ishbosheth, as above), and (ver. 41) the Hittite.

Also, while the Reubenite and the Gentile nouns Ashterathite and Aroerite are at once recognized, the Mithnite, Tizite, Mahavite, and Mesobaite are not traceable elsewhere, the plural form of the last but one being an additional source of obscurity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAdina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Thirty with him.

As the writer of Chronicles indicates no difference, nor any sense of a change of persons enumerated, when he has reached (ver. 41) Uriah the Hittite, it would all the rather be consistent with his own superscription when (ver. 26) he proposes to set forth simply \"the valiant men of the armies\" without confining their number to the \"thirty.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - The Ashterathite.

The occasion referred to is evidently that recorded in 1 Samuel 27:1, 2, 6, 7; 1 Samuel 30:1, 26; and generally in those and the intermediate chapters. David stayed at Ziklag a year and four months, a period which closed for him with the death of Saul. Ziklag, in Joshus's original allotment, was the possession of Simeon (Joshua 19:5). It was situated south of Judah, and came into the hands of Judah when Achish made it a gift to David for a rest-deuce (1 Samuel 27:5-7). The site of it has not been identified in later times. It witnessed one of the narrowest and most remarkable of the escapes of David, on an occasion which brought danger, not so much from acknowledged foes, as from the maddened grief and despair of his own friends and people (1 Samuel 30:3-6). The whole scene of the broken-hearted grief of David and his people, when, on discovering the successful raid of the Amalekites upon Ziklag, \"they lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep,\" is one of the most dramatic on record. The rapid reverse to good fortune, when David turns away their heedless anger against himself and proposal to stone him, by pursuing and overcoming the enemy, and recovering their captives and their goods near the brook Besor, completes the effectiveness of the scene. The middle voice form of expression in this verse, kept himself close, means to say that David was, by fear of Saul and by force of his enemies, more or less hemmed up in Ziklag.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Of Saul's brethren of Benjamin. It would be better to read these words as the commencement of the next verse. Prominence is given to the fact that this set of helpers of David, counting in all twenty-three, comprised Benjamites - men of the same tribe with Saul (ver. 29). They had seen and been impressed by the wrongness and cruelty of Saul, and found themselves unable to keep in sympathy with him. Of such were Eleazar, Ilai, and Ithai, mentioned in the preceding chapter (1 Chronicles 11:12, 29, 31, respectively). The Benjamites were noted both for their use of the bow, and of their own left hand (Judges 3:15, 21; Judges 20:15, 16; 1 Chronicles 8:39, 40; 2 Chronicles 14:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite. The Peshito-Syriac has בְּנו instead of בֵּנֵי. This has the effect of making Joash the son of Ahiezer, and it makes Shemaah a third name in the list. This name has in the Hebrew the form for the article before it, and should appear in our version either as \"Has-Shemaah,\" or \"the Shemaah.\" The name, together with that of Azmaveth, is found in 1 Chronicles 8:13, 36, as belonging to the Benjamite tribe. The name Jeziel is omitted in the Syriac Version, and the two names Pelet and Berachah appear as sons of Azmaveth (1 Chronicles 11:33; 2 Samuel 23:31, where the Baharmite means the Baharumite, i.e. the man of Bahurim, in Benjamin). The Antothite; that is, native of Anathoth. The place is not given in Joshua 18; but it was a \"priests' city\" with \"suburbs,\" belonging to Benjamin (1 Chronicles 11:28; Joshua 21:18; 1 Kings 2:26; Jeremiah 1:1; Jeremiah 29:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Among the thirty, and over the thirty. Yet the name of Ismaiah does not appear in the list of the preceding chapter, nor in its parallel; nor is it possible to identify it with any that does appear there. The suggested explanation is that he was in the first edition of that list, and died early. The expression, \"among the thirty, and over the thirty,\" may possibly mean that, from distinction as one of them, he was promoted above them to be leader of them. Josabad the Gederathite. The name should be spelt Jozabad. The Gederah here suggested cannot to all appearance be that of Joshua 15:36, in the Shephelah of Judah, as Jozabad was a Benjamite. If otherwise, it must be supposed to have come in some way into the possession of Benjamin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Jerimoth. This name is found also among Benjamites (1 Chronicles 7:8). Bealiah. This name comprises both the word Baal, and Jah! Haruphite. The Masoretic word is חחֲרִיפי (Nehemiah 7:34). The sons of Hariph (Nehemiah 7:24) may have belonged to the tribe of Benjamin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Jashobeam. Possibly the same with him of 1 Chronicles 11:11; 1 Chronicles 27:2. Korhites. Some authorities are as positive that this name designates Levitic Korahites, as others are sceptical about it. Bertheau explains the name as meaning descendants of Korah of Judah (1 Chronicles 2:43). Others surmise that a Benjamite Korah, otherwise unknown to us, is pointed to. There does not seem any intrinsic difficulty in supposing that these were some of the Levite Korahites, whose proper and allotted abode was in Benjamin, or perhaps in Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Of Gedor. The place apparently here spoken of (yet see 1 Chronicles 8:31; 1 Chronicles 9:37) is unknown, and it is to be observed that in the Hebrew the article precedes the word (הַגְּדור). If it be the Gedor in Judah (1 Chronicles 4:4), it is to be noted still that Jeroham is a name of a Benjamite (1 Chronicles 8:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - As ver. 1 is introduced by the description of those who came together \"to David to Ziklag\" at a certain time, so it seems evident that this verse introduces the mention of certain others who befriended David at another time, by coming to him into the hold to the wilderness. These others were Gadites in part, and the hold none more likely than that of Adullam (ver. 16 of last chapter), although the word here employed (לַמְצַד) for \"hold\" is a different form of the word (מְצוּדָה) found both there and in the parallel (2 Samuel 23:14). There is, however, nothing to negative the choice of other spots and occasions (1 Samuel 22:5; 1 Samuel 23:14, 19, 24, 29, Authorized Version; 1 Samuel 24:1, Authorized Version). This graphic description of the military and indeed native qualities of these Gadites, is in harmony with many other glimpses we get of them and their character (1 Chronicles 5:19-22; 2 Samuel 1:23; 2 Samuel 2:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEzer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-13. - The eleven names of these verses are all known elsewhere, but none of them as designating the same persons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAttai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJohanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - One of the least was over an hundred. This, evidently an incorrect translation, is easily superseded by the correct literal version, One to a hundred the little one, and the great one one to a thousand. The preposition lamed prefixed to the two numerals,\" hundred\" and\" thousand,\" will signify either that the \"little one was as good as a hundred, and the great one as good as a thousand;\" or that the \"little one was rare as one of a hundred, and the great one rare as one of a thousand.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - In the first month. This corresponds with our end of March. The interesting incident of this verse is unrecorded in detail elsewhere (Joshua 3:15; Jeremiah 12:5; Jeremiah 49:19; Jeremiah 50:44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - In addition to the Gadites, some others of Benjamin and Judah join David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The solemn tone of David's language recorded here, and the beautiful pathos and religious appeal of the last two sentences of the verse, bespeak sufferings and disappointments experienced by David heretofore through deception. It is, however, noticeable that there is no direct testimony of anything of this kind, least of all of any flagrant instance of it, on the part of such detachments of friends as had come to him; and that, though they had occasionally been contributed from sources not the most desirable (1 Samuel 22:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The response of the band, by the mouth of Amasai was worthy of the character of the appeal that David made, both in its heartiness and its high tone. Amasai. Possibly the same with Amasa (1 Chronicles 2:17), the son of Abigail (David's sister), wife of Jether (2 Samuel 17:25; 2 Samuel 18:6; 2 Samuel 19:13; 2 Samuel 20:10). Ewald discusses this point ('Genesis Int.,' 2:544). He was made captain of the host by Absalom, afterwards by David, and Joab put an end to his life. The Spirit (see Numbers 11:26; Nehemiah 9:30). The more literal translation of the verb came upon is clothed. Most interesting and instructive is the subject of the gradually developing manifestation of the agency of the eternal Spirit from the beginning of the world. Through the ascending illustrations of his natural work in creation (Genesis 1:2), his relation to human bodily life (Genesis 2:7; Job 27:3), his intellectual work of various kinds (Genesis 41:38; Exodus 28:3; Numbers 24:2; Judges 9:29), we are led on to his highest spiritual functions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And there fell... of Manasseh to David. Of this use of נָפַל עלאּ there are many other examples (2 Chronicles 15:9; Jeremiah 37:14; Jeremiah 39:9). The phrase does not correspond with our own idiom of \"falling to\" one's lot, but with that of\" falling away\" from the service or love of one to another, i.e. deserting. The occasion here spoken of is described in full in 1 Samuel 29:2-11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Although those of Manasseh who wished to ally themselves with David did not - most providentially for David and his Ziklag people - have the opportunity of aiding him when, on the eve of Gilboa, he was about to aid Achish the prince of the Philistines against the Israelites and Saul, yet their help must have come in useful when, on his return \"to Ziklag on the third day,\" he found what the Amalekites had done, and pursued them (1 Samuel 30:1-6, 11-25). Seven is the number also of Eastern Manasseh mentioned in 1 Chronicles 5:24. Nothing is now said of the men belonging to them joining with them. Jozabad. One manuscript quoted by Kennicott has for this name on its first occurrence Jechabar. It is scarcely likely that the same name should appear twice in this short list, without some qualifying mark being put to one of the two. Nothing else is known of these seven cap-talus of the thousands of Manasseh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The band.

A forcible comment on the metaphorical use of this phrase is found in 1 Samuel 14:15; Authorized Version, \"a very great trembling\" is the translation of Hebrew \"trembling of God.\" The for with which this verse commences probably explains the call there was for many and able \"captains\" for a host becoming daily larger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. The bands; rather, the chief men, or captains, by one or the other of which words this same term has been several times hitherto rendered in the immediate context (yet see Judges 9:37, 44, and Judges 5:30 for yet a third signification). There follow (vers. 24-37) the numbers of each tribe (the full thirteen being enumerated) who \"came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel.\" The large numbers of some of the joyful pilgrims to Hebron, as for instance of the trans-Jordanic tribes, the very small number that came of the tribe of Judah (in fact, lowest but one, i.e. Benjamin, and yet nearest home), and of some others, help to invest with doubt the numerals of this passage, although it is not at all difficult to suggest some very passable explanations of these phenomena. This doubt is not lessened by the total, which, according to this list, must make a figure between three hundred and forty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand men. To the host have to be added, as we are expressly told, the \"asses, camels, mules, and oxen,\" which carried the \"bread, meat, meal, cakes of figs and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance,\" for the consumption of the host during their \"three days' \"stay \"with David,\" and their journeys to and fro. In the presence of such numbers, and the celebration of such an occasion, Hebron must indeed have beheld the reflection of its own probable meaning, of the \"fellowship\" or \"community\" of society. To turn the kingdom of Saul to him (so 1 Chronicles 10:14). The phrase is not a common one. According to the word of the Lord (so 1 Chronicles 11:3; 1 Samuel 16:1, 12, 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - David had already found friends and adherents in these two southern tribes of Judah and Simeon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Jahoiada.

Compare Tacitus, \"gnarus temporum\" ('Agricola,' §6). This verse does not tell the number of the \"children,\" but only of the \"heads\" of Issachar. It is possible that the number has slipped out.

To sum the number of the men here described, we should require to allow for those of Issachar and of the Aaronites and Zadokites added to the Levites (vers. 26-28).

The meaning is that not only the \"brethren\" of Judah and of the nearer neighbourhood of Hebron joined to entertain and to show hospitality to the immense throngs of visitors, but that others did so in ever-widening circles, even as far as the remoter Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali. For there was joy in Israel. The joy must have been largely enhanced by the national consciousness of divided rule coming to an end, and of the cloud and frown of the Divine countenance having cleared mercifully away.

For we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. The allusion may be considered delicately worded, but an inexpressible pathos and unmeasured condemnation must be imagined as clinging to this sentence, illustrated further by 1 Samuel 7:2; 1 Samuel 28:6, 15, 16; 1 Chronicles 10:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - All Israel. The parallel gives the number as thirty thousand men (2 Samuel 6:1, 2). Shihor of Egypt. According to Gesenius, this Shihor is from root שָׁחֲר meaning \"to be turbid\" or \"black\" (so Latin melo, from the Greek; Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:278, 291; Catullus, 67:33). There can surely be little doubt that it is the river Nile which is here spoken of, after comparison of the following passages: - Joshua 13:3; Isaiah 23:3; Jeremiah 2:18. Though others, quoting Joshua 13:3 and Joshua 19:26, and interpreting Shihor generically as applicable to any dark, turbid stream, make it the modern Wady el-Arish, However, the parallel, 1 Kings 8:65, does not necessarily dissever the נַחַל from נָהַר of Egypt (Genesis 15:18), but rather tends to identify them. The entering of Hemath; i.e. the way to Hamath (Hebrew, חְמָת; Numbers 34:7, 8). Hamath was one of the great cities of the Orontes valley, in Upper Syria, which formed the boundary in especial of the empire of Solomon. This valley is watered by the Orontes, the river of Antioch, a river remarkable for its abundant spring (situate immediately north of the source of the Leontes), which won for it the name, among all the other springs of Syria, of \"The Spring,\" and remarkable for \"the length of its course, the volume of its waters, and the rich vegetation of its banks.\" It is the one of the four rivers which take their rise beneath the heights of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon which becomes really worthy of the name of river, the other three, viz. the Jordan, the Leontes or modern Litany of Phoeicia, and the Abana or modern Barada of Damascus, more resembling the nature of the mountain stream. This river was to the ancient Romans \"the representative of Syria, as the Timings might be said to be of England, and in later times the region formed the chief point of contact between this part of Asia and the West\" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 414, e,f, edit. 1866). The kingdom of Hamath comprised the tract of this valley of the Orontes, skirted by the hills separating the Leontes from the Orontes, and extending to the Pass of Daphne below Antioch. Riblah (Numbers 34:11; 2 Kings 23:33) lies on the east bank of the Orontes, thirty-five miles north-east of Baal-bek, or Baal-gad. The people of Hamath were of the race of Ham, of the descendants of Canaan (Genesis 10:18), and are not to be reckoned as of Phoenician origin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - To Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim (see Joshua 15:9-11; 1 Samuel 4:7; 2 Samuel 6:2; where the name is spelt with a final yod instead of he). A third name of this same place, Kirjath-baal, is found in Joshua 15:60; Joshua 18:14. Probably the present 'Arms, a ruin (i.q. Kirjath-arim, Ezra 2:25) on the brink of the valley of Sorek, may be the place (see Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' p. 419, 2nd edit.). We read in Joshua 9:17-27 how the men of Kirjath-jearim had been made by Joshua \"hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord.\" Hither to this Kirjath-jearim the ark had been conveyed from Bethshemesh (1 Samuel 7:1, 2), and here it \"abode\" long time, \"for it was twenty years.\" Perhaps the word \"abode\" in this passage may be equivalent to abode unmoved (1 Samuel 14.18, 19). For though the chronology from the death of Eli, through the remainder of Samuel's career and of Saul's, seems almost hopelessly uncertain, yet it would appear certain that the interval exceeded twenty years, to the time that David now takes in hand to bring home, as it were, the ark. The ark of God, the Lord. Though the Authorized Version of this passage is better and cleverer than that of the parallel (2 Samuel 6:2), yet it is left somewhat obscure. The comma should follow the name God. Jehovah sitting upon the cherubim then follows as a clause in apposition, while the last three words (as the name is called, rather than whose name) state that clause to contain \"the Name of the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 10:8; Deuteronomy 31:9; 1 Samuel 4:4; 1 Samuel 5:3; 1 Samuel 6:8). Bertheau, following Thenius, proposes to change the Hebrew ֵשם into שָׁם. But there are abundant objections to this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They carried; the Authorized Version of the parallel \"they set\" But the verb is the Hiph. of רָכַב, a word carrying more of majesty in its use (Deuteronomy 33:26; Job 30:22; Psalm 18:11; 68:38; Isaiah 19:1). A new cart. The stress laid on the newness of this cart, the term being twice repeated in the parallel passage, may justly remind of Mark 11:2; Matthew 27:60 (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on 2 Samuel 6:3). The house of Abinadab. There is no mention of Abinadab that would indicate that he still lived, even when twenty years before, the ark was placed in his house. Eleazar was his eldest son (1 Samuel 7:1), and was \"sanctified to keep the ark of the Lord.\" Uzza and Ahio were possibly sons of Eleazar, and not sons of Abinadab, and Eleazar's younger brothers. The Septuagint translates Ahio, and accordingly reads, \"Uzza and his brethren drave the cart.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Played before God. The Hebrew word is the Piel of שׂחק, the root of which, from the simplest meaning of \"to laugh\" (and with the two appropriate prepositions used for laughing with an expression of derision or contempt), through the two further meanings of \"sporting\" and \"jesting,\" passes to the signification of dancing\" (1 Samuel 18:7; Jeremiah 31:4). Its deepest idea seems to be \"to make merry,\" and to savour of the very same ambiguity attaching to that idiom with ourselves. The parallel of this passage exhibits \"before the Lord.\" With all their might. See the evident mistake of the parallel (\"on all manner of instruments made of firwood,\" literally, with all firwoods) through similarity of the Hebrew characters. Cymbals and... trumpets. Of the five names of musical instruments, the same in number in both passages, the first three are the same in the Hebrew, but these last two are different words, וּבִמְצִלְתַּיִם וּבַחֲלֺצצְרות here for וּבִמנַענִעים וּבְצלְצליִם A variation of this particular kind again indicates with some decisiveness the different character and the number of the sources from which the writers of the Books of Samuel and those of Chronicles took.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The threshingfloor of Chidon. For Chidon, the parallel place has Nachon; possibly these are two names of the same place, or one form is a corruption of the ether; but there is nothing to determine for us which. Owing to the meaning of Nachon being \"prepared,\" the version of Aquila is \"to the prepared threshingfloor,\" with which the Jonathan Targum agrees, and (for this Chronicles passage) the Joseph Targum gives אֲתַר מְתַקַּן. The threshing-floor was a circular plot of hard ground, from fifty to one hundred feet in diameter, on which the oxen trampled out the grain. Threshingfloors evidently often became landmarks, and helped to designate places (Genesis 50:10; 2 Samuel 24:16). The oxen stumbled. In the parallel place the Authorized Version renders \"shook it.\" The Hebrew verb is the same (שָׁמַט) in both places. Its elementary meanings are \"to strike\" and \"to throw down.\" Perhaps the meaning is near the Vulgate rendering, calcitrabant, and equivalent to the rendering, became restive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - There seems some little uncertainty as to why Uzza was to blame in a desire that would appear both praiseworthy and instinctive, to steady the ark or save it from actually falling. Uzza was probably not a priest or Levite, and it is so distinctly said his sin consisted in putting his hand to the ark, that perhaps the direction of Numbers 4:15 may be sufficient account of the matter. Special injunction had been given (Exodus 25:14, 15) that the poles with which to bear it should not be taken out of the rings, but be always stationary there. If we suppose that it was not a question of the ark being absolutely overthrown, but simply of its riding unsteadily, his presumptuousness would not have the further defence of an instinctive impulse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Displeased. The Hebrew root. (חָרָה) betokens a mixture of anger and grief. It is the word used of Jonah (Jonah 4:1, 9), and perhaps our English word \"vexed\" or \"hurt,\" would convey its meaning. Had made a breach; literally, had broken forth a breaking forth on Uzza; i.e. had fiercely broken forth on Uzza. There are many exactly analogous uses of both verb and noun in the Hebrew. To this day. This phrase, also found in the parallel place, indicates the lapse of time from the historical point of time to the point of record.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Obed-edom the Gittite. That Obed-edom is called \"the Gittite,\" i.e. of Gath-rimmon, a Levite city of Dan (Joshua 21:24), might probably indicate that there was another Obed-edom, from whom to distinguish him. Such a one would appear readily to offer in the name of Obed-edom, son of Jeduthun, a \"Merarite Levite\" (ch. 15:18-24; 16:5, 38; 26:4-15). But the difficulty occurs that an expression in this last quotation seems to identify him with the Obed-edom of 2 Samuel 6:11; and the last sentence of our next verse. If they are one and the same, it has been suggested that marriage might account for the Merarite living in a Kohathite city (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on 2 Samuel 6:10).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months.

Beside this Hiram or Huram, the king, there was another Hiram or Huram, the same king's chief artificer, and whom he sent to the help of Solomon (1 Kings 7:13, 40; 2 Chronicles 2:13; 2 Chronicles 4:11, 16). The willing aid which this king lent to David on this occasion, in supplying cedar timber and workmen, was \"the commencement of that amity between the Tyriaus and the Hebrews, so mutually advantageous to the two nations, the one agricultural and the other commercial\" (Milman's 'History of the Jews,' 1:239). The meaning of the name Hiram is probably \"noble,\" or \"highborn.\" This disposition, at all events, he seems to have illustrated in his generous friendship to David, Solomon, and their people. Very little to be relied upon is known of him outside Scripture, but his reign is said to have extended from B.C. 1023-990.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Was lifted up. The passage in Samuel reads נִשֵּׂא, the Piel conjugation. The present form is obscure, נִשֵׂאת. It may be considered either an irregular Niphal third pers. fem.; or Niphal infin, absolute (2 Samuel 19:43); or possibly even an irregular Piel form, in which case the pronoun \"he\" will need to be supplied as the subject. Supposing that any special connection subsists between this and the previous verse, it is not necessary to consider it remote. Then, as now, the building of a house for one's self, much more the building of a noble palace on the part of a king, is an indication of feeling settled and \"confirmed.\" It was a partial indication of the \"lifted-up kingdom\" that the king should have a palace of unwonted magnificence. This must have weighed all the more in the case of a nation which, not for its sacred things, nor for its king, nor for its people, had ever had as yet any adequate and worthy housing,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - David took more wives. As matter of course, we do not look in this connection for any remarks to be made by the writer condemnatory of David's enlargement of the harem, or of his having an harem at all. Yet it is open to us to note how, at a time when polygamy was \"winked at,\" and no sin was necessarily to lie on this account at the door of David, yet by this very thing he was undermining the peace and unity of his own family, the comfort of his declining years once and again, and the very stability of his house in the days of Solomon his son. The less necessitated we are to regard David's polygamy in the light of individual sin, the more emphatic in the light of history does the tendency of the practice proclaim itself as thoroughly and irredeemably bad.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - The names of his children which he had in Jerusalem.

It will be observed that the present list agrees with that of Samuel in respect of eleven names, and with 1 Chronicles 3:5-8, so far as number goes, with all thirteen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.

From a careful comparison of this passage with the parallel and with 2 Samuel 23:12-14, it appears likely that the meaning is that \"David went out against them\" after having \"gone down\" first to the \"hold,\" probably at the \"cave of Adullam\" (1 Chronicles 11:15-17). When it is said that the Philistines went up to seek David, the sequel makes it evident that they did not seek him as friends. And it is to be remembered that the Philistines held territory near Jerusalem at this time, and to the north of it (1 Samuel 31:7-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Spread themselves. The root, פָשַׁט appears here for the נָטַש of the parallel place. So also again in ver. 13 of this chapter. In the valley of Rephaim; i.e. of giants, though some translate \"healers,\" and yet others \"chiefs.\" Though not Canaanites, they once held portions of Canaan. Their origin is very uncertain. Kalisch ('Commentary on Old Testament,' p. 351) thinks they were descendants of Japheth (Genesis 14:5; Genesis 15:20; Deuteronomy 2:9-11; Deuteronomy 3:11). The \"valley\" was south of Jerusalem, but whether more south-east or south-west is not certain; probably the former (Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:16; Isaiah 17:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - David inquired of God. The \"inquiring\" was made, as matter of course, through the high priest, and not merely, as we should say, in private prayer (Judges 1:1, 3; Judges 20:23, 27; 1 Samuel 23:2, 4; 1 Samuel 30:8; 2 Samuel 2:1). The directness of the Divine answer was some echo of the old reply when Judah was authorized to go up against the Canaanites (Judges 1:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Baal-perazim; literally, master of breaches. Gesenius traces this meaning, through the intermediate idea of \"possessor,\" to that (in this case, that place), which \"possesses,\" i.e. is the subject of such a signal overwhelming as is here described, the scene of overwhelming defeats, like the irresistible rush of waters (Isaiah 28:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And when they had left their gods there. The parallel translates more literally, \"And there they left,\" as we might also do here; and goes on to read\" their images,\" in place of \"their gods\" (2 Samuel 5:21). These they burned with fire, according to the command of Deuteronomy 7:5, 25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-17. - Another victory over the Philistines. Verse 13. - In the valley; i.e. the valley of Rephaim, as is expressly stated in the parallel place, though left in no obscurity here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. The meaning of the directions as here given is sufficiently evident, yet it is somewhat more forcibly expressed in the parallel place, \"Thou shalt not go up,\" i.e. \"against the Philistines\" (see our tenth verse, and note the form of David's inquiry); \"but fetch a compass behind them.\" The mulberry trees were evidently behind the Philistines. The Hebrew word for the trees here spoken of is הַבְּכָאִים, and the correct rendering of it is probably neither \"mulberry\" nor, as the Septuagint and Vulgate translate, \"pear\" trees. But judging from the probable derivation (בָּכָה, to weep), they were trees of the balsam species, and it seems that this is as far as we can safely conjecture. One of the latest authorities (see Condor's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 398, 2nd edit.) pronounces it an \"unknown species.\" The tree, strange to say, is only mentioned here and in the parallel place. A summary of opinions as to the tree intended may be found in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:439, and this is just sufficient to show that it is not as yet identified with any semblance of certainty. However, it is easy to understand hew the balsam species, from which the exuding gum resembles \"tears,\" might come by the name set forth in the present Hebrew root.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A sound of going. This is net a mere generic or longer form of expression to signify a sound itself. There is significance in the word \"going.\" The sense of the Hebrew word would be thrown out more emphatically by such a rendering as, the sound of steps (literally, stepping). When the motion of the agitated leaves simulated the sound of steps, the stepping of men, then David and his army were to step forth to battle. Though the root of the \"stepping\" spoken of as heard in the trees is not identical with that of the \"going\" repeated twice in the remainder of the verse - Then thou shalt go out... for God is gone forth - yet it does alliterate to some extent with it, and rather creates the impression that it was intended to do so. However, the parallel place does not sustain this impression, inasmuch as a different word, \"Thou shalt bestir thyself,\" is there employed, in place of the first occurrence of our supposed alliteration, in the clause, \"Thou shalt go out.\" There is something stirring to the imagination, and probably it was felt so by David and his men, in the signal unseen yet not unheard, and in a sense not of earth, but midway between earth and heaven. The very various voices of the various trees, according to the character of their foliage, may well set poetry going, and startle or fascinate imagination, as the case may be. The music of one tree or grove is as different from that of another as can be - listen to the difference between the melancholy plaint so unceasing of some plantation of firs, and the multitudinous, silvery, rippling of but one white poplar of good size. Presumably the sound in the present ease more resembled that of the steady tramp of them that march.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDavid therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Gibeon. The parallel reads Geba. As Geba and Gibeon were both situate very near to Jerusalem (on the north), as well as near to one another, both texts may be correct, and each mean what it says. But Isaiah 28:21 confirms the reading Gibeon. It is evident that Gibeon was no appropriate resting-place for the ark (1 Chronicles 13:3, 4; 2 Chronicles 1:3). The nearness of the Philistines' approach to the city of Jerusalem marks their daring on the one hand, and the loud call now for the merciful interposition of Jehovah on behalf of his people. Gazer. Hebrew גָּזְרָה, both here and in the parallel because of the accent. Else the name is Gezer (גֶּזר). It was about two hours distant from Gibeon, and to the north of it (Joshua 10:33; Joshua 12:12; Joshua 21:21; Judges 1:29; 1 Chronicles 20:4), or \"four Roman miles northward from Nicopolis ('Onomasticon'); now the large ruin of Tell Jezar\" (Conder's' Handbook to the Bible,' p. 412).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.VERSEENDNEWLINE","1Chr.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The contents of this verse and the following verses up to the twenty-fifth have no parallel in the Book of Samuel, and excite suggestion respecting the different objects with which the compiler of Chronicles wrote, as compared with those of the author of the former work. They also direct fresh attention to the sources upon which they drew. The history of the preparations made for the reception of the ark, and for its safe and religious escort into the city, is now proceeded with. These preparations occupied the three months, or part of the three months, spoken of in 1 Chronicles 13:14. The houses may have been both his own (1 Chronicles 14:1) and the buildings referred to in 1 Chronicles 11:8 and 2 Samuel 5:9. The old tent, or tabernacle, is repeatedly alluded to, as in 1 Chronicles 16:39; 2 Chronicles 1:3. It will be remembered that the tabernacle established by Joshua at Shiloh remained there till the time of Eli, and the ark within it (1 Samuel 3:3). Afterwards we find it removed to Nob, for there David ate the shewbread (1 Samuel 21:6). From thence, very possibly after the savage slaughter of the priests by the order of Saul, it was removed, and we find it at Gibeon, according to the above references. Here at Gibeon was an altar and \"high place,\" which, in the earlier time of Solomon, formed the chief religious centre. The wanderings of the ark already given from Shiloh, through Philistia to Beth-she-mesh, Kirjath-jearim, Perez-uzzah, now land it in this tent in Jerusalem. It is no more sheltered in the tabernacle. But the tabernacle, as well as the ark, was ultimately brought to the new-built temple of Solomon (1 Kings 8:4; 1 Chronicles 9:19; 2 Chronicles 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This verse together with vers. 12-15 show that the severe lesson of the destruction of Uzzah had been laid to heart, and had made David supremely anxious to take better counsel of the Law. Uzzah, though possibly the son of a Levite, more probably of a Hivite (Joshua 9:7, 17), was not a priest, nor is there any sufficient evidence that he was a Levite; and most distinct was the order of the Law (Numbers 1:51-53; Numbers 3:29-32; 4:15420), that \"when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.\" So the sons of Kohath are to come to bear the sanctuary with all its sacred vessels, \"but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.\" Many things were allowed to be carried on waggons under the charge of the Gershonites and Merarites, but the strict contents of the sanctuary were to be borne in a specified manner by the Kohathites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All Israel; i.e. as before, representatives of all Israel.

The mention of the six representative Levitical families follows. That of Kohath (ver. 5) takes the lead, because, though second in order of birth (Genesis 46:11; Exodus 6:16-19; 1 Chronicles 6:1-30), its priestly importance gave it always first rank. To the same head belonged also three of the remaining five families, viz.

The other two required to complete the six are Asaiah (ver. 6) of the house of Merari, and Joel (ver. 7) of the house of Gershom. The representatives, then, of these six families, with the company of the brethren belonging to each of them, and the two priests Zadok and Abiathar (ver. 11), are now summoned into the presence of David, to receive a short but special charge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren. Nothing of the appointed observances of the Law are to be omitted this time, as in the haste and want of premeditation of the former occasion (Exodus 19:22; Exodus 28:41; Exodus 40:13; Leviticus 8:12; Leviticus 20:7; Leviticus 21:8; 2 Chronicles 5:11; 2 Chronicles 29:15). These \"sanctifyings\" consisted of different observances, according to the person and the occasion, but largely of ablutions of the body, washing of the clothes, and keeping separate from all natural and ceremonial causes of uncleanness in ordinary cases of Levitical service. That ye may bring up the ark. The word here employed for \"bring\" is not the same with the \"carry\" of vers 1 and 2. But the following verses (13-15) seem to intimate that, whatever the exact reason for which Uzzah had been peremptorily cut off, the Levites had also been to blame in not sanctifying themselves to carry the ark by its staves in the way originally appointed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This verse purports to say that the Levites had been deficient in their duty in the double sense of not having themselves exclusively undertaken the removal of the ark, and not having executed that removal after the due order.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - (So see Exodus 25:13-15; Numbers 4:15; Numbers 7:9.) It is plain that from the first stress was laid upon the rings and the staves through them by which the ark was to be carried, as also the \"table of shittim wood\" (Exodus 25:26-28) and the \"altar\" (Exodus 27:4-7) and the \"altar of incense\" (Exodus 30:4, 5). However, these rings and staves were not found in the permanent furniture of the temple, except only for the ark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - To appoint their brethren to be the singers. This was the first step towards what we have already read in 1 Chronicles 6:31-39, 44; 1 Chronicles 9:33, 34 (where see notes).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Ben. This word is either altogether an accidental interpolation, or a remnant of some statement of the patronymic character regarding Zechariah. Another indication of the state of the text in this verse is to be found in the probable omission of the name Azazgah of ver. 21, after Jeiel. It will be observed that no trace of this word Ben is found in the repeated list of ver. 20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-21. - The psalteries on Alamoth (ver. 20), and harps on the Sheminith to excel (ver. 21), are descriptions the exact significance of which is not yet satisfactorily ascertained. Yet their connection in a series of four divisions of musical duty does throw some light upon them. These four verses manifestly purport to describe a special part to be performed by those of whom they respectively speak. Gesenius explains psalteries on Alamoth to mean such instruments as savoured of virgin tone or pitch, i.e. high as compared with the lower pitch of men's voices. This lower pitch he considers intimated by the word \"Sheminith,\" literally, the eighth, or octave. The added expression, \"to excel,\" need scarcely be, with him, understood to mean \"to take the lead musically,\" but may be read generally to mark their supassing quality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For song. There is considerable diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this word. Some think its meaning to be \"in the carrying (בַּמַּשָּׂא)\" i.e. of the ark. Its exact position here seems not unfavourable to such interpretation. On the other hand, its position in ver. 27 seems conclusively to point to the translation of the Septuagint and of our Authorized Version in this place as the correct one. Dr. Murphy, however, to escape this, thinks \"with the singers\" in ver. 27 to be a \"copyist's inadvertent repetition.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Berechiah and Elkanah. It appears from the following verse that there was also another couple of doorkeepers (i.e. persons to protect the openings of the ark, that it should not be opened), viz. Obed-edom and Jehiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Between these couples probably went the seven priests blowing the trumpets (Numbers 10:1-9). These trumpets were of solid silver, of one piece, were straight and narrow, and had an expanded mouth. They are found on the arch of Titus, and are described by Josephus. On the other hand, the trumpet, more correctly rendered \"cornet\" (שׁופָר, as distinguished from our חְצועְרָה, which was used for proclaiming the jubilee, for announcing the new year for sentinel and other special signals, and for war, was shaped like a ram's horn, and probably made of the same. The particular appropriateness of the use of the former on this occasion is manifest, in addition to the fact that they were the appointed trumpets for the journeying of the camp and a fortiori of the ark itself at a time so essentially religious as the present. Yet, as we learn from ver. 28, the latter were used as well, and cymbals, psalteries, and harps. The original number of the silver trumpets was two only, and they were to be sounded strictly by the anointed priests, sons of Aaron, at all events when their employment was within the sanctuary. Their employment, however, grew far more general, and we find (2 Chronicles 5:12) that their number had risen to a hundred and twenty (so too 2 Chronicles 13:12; Nehemiah 12:35). For Obed-edom, the doorkeeper, see 1 Chronicles 16:38; and therewith note on 1 Chronicles 13:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - This verse with the following four are paralleled by 2 Samuel 6:12-16 The contents of this verse in particular reveal the intense anxiety and the trembling fear and awe with which the sacred burden was now again lifted. A world of meaning and of feeling for all those present at least underlay the expression, When God helped the Levites that bare the ark (comp. 1 Samuel 6:14, 15; 2 Samuel 6:13, 18). The offering of seven bullocks and seven rams is thought by some to he additional to David's offering, when he had gone \"six paces\" (2 Samuel 6:13). Much more probably, however, the \"six paces\" meant, not six footsteps, but six lengths that would make some distance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Several things in this verse indicate a somewhat uncertain and unsteady selection of particulars by the compiler from his original sources. The natural reading of the verse would seem to say that David and all those Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, all wore the robe of byssus, while David had, in addition, the ephod of linen. Yet it is unlikely that all did wear the robe. Again, the Hebrew text exhibits no preposition before the singers, on the second occasion of the occurrence of the expression in this verse. Yet little sense can be found without a preposition. The robe was not distinctively a priest's garment (1 Samuel 18:4; 1 Samuel 24:5, 12; 2 Samuel 13:18; Job 1:20; Job 2:12), though priests did wear it. The robe of byssus is spoken of only here; 2 Chronicles 5:12; and Esther 8:15. Byssus, however, is spoken of as material for other purposes in 1 Chronicles 4:21; 2 Chronicles 2:14; 2 Chronicles 3:14; Esther 1:6; Ezekiel 27:16. The ephod, on the other hand, was no doubt distinctively a high priest's garment (Exodus 28:4-12), though we read of Samuel wearing one (1 Samuel 2:18, 28), and of David doing the same, as on this occasion. The fine linen (בּוצ), in the first clause of this verse, is not the same with that (בָּך) in the last clause. The first clause of this verse (which makes the last clause somewhat redundant) bears some resemblance in letters to the 2 Samuel 6:14 fourteenth verse of 2 Samuel 6. first clause, which means, \"and David danced with all his might,\" and the two clauses exactly answer to one another in position - another suggestion of an uncertain text here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Making a noise. This description qualifies the cymbals alone, and should rather appear in our translation as \"noise-making cymbals.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Thus briefly is given by our compiler what occupies five verses (2 Samuel 6:19, 20-23) in the Book of Samuel. Neither of the words here rendered dancing and playing (but which would be better rendered \"leaping and dancing\") is the same with those employed in 2 Samuel 6:14, 16, where our Authorized Version rendering is \"dancing\" and \"leaping and dancing\" respectively. The word in both of those verses that represents the dancing, does correctly so represent, bet is a somewhat generic form, as it carries the idea of dancing in a circle. The reason of Michal \"despising David in her heart\" can only be found in the unreason and the irreligion of that heart itself. She was a type of not a few, who despise devotion, enthusiasm, and above all practical liberality and generosity, on the part of any individual of their own family, when these are shown to Christ and his Church, and when they think they may be a trifle the poorer for it, or when they feel that the liberality and devotion of another exposes their own \"poverty\" in both these respects.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. So ch. 15:1 distinctly states that David had \"pitched a tent\" for the ark, and evidently to be ready for its arrival. On the other hand, there is no mention of any such tent having been got in readiness in ch. 13. or in 2 Samuel 6:1-11, which give the account of the attempt that disastrously failed. The expressions which are there used would rather lead to the conclusion that David's intention was to take the sacred structure into his own home (2 Samuel 6:9, 10; 1 Chronicles 13:12, 13), for a while, at all events. The אֹהֶל (tent) of the original designates, when Intended strictly, a haircloth covering, resting on poles or planks (Exodus 26:7, 11; Exodus 36:14, 19). The first occasion of the use of the word is found in Genesis 4:20. The סֻכָּח (booth) was made of leaves and branches interwoven (Leviticus 23:34, 40, 42; Deuteronomy 16:13). The מִשְׁכָּן (tabernacle) was the dwelling-place or pavilion, which owned to the ten inner curtains as well as the outer covering and the framework (Exodus 25:9; Exodus 26:1, 12-15, etc.; Exodus 39:32; 40:2, 29). The first occurrence of this word is in the first of these last-quoted references. Burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. The identical words of 2 Samuel 6:17, 18, where the Authorized Version translates \"burnt offerings and peace offerings.\" These were the two great sacrifices - the former speaking of atonement (Leviticus 1:3-9, etc.), the latter of reconciliation effected and the enjoyment of peace (Leviticus 3:1-5, etc.). Neither here nor in the parallel place is any mention made of the altar upon which these sacrifices were offered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He blessed the people in the name of the Lord; i.e. reverently in the Name of the Lord, and as vividly conscious of being in his presence, he pronounces blessings upon the people, and by short ejaculatory prayer and holy wish further begs for them those blessings which God only can give. In the time of David and Solomon (1 Kings 8:14) the king realized far more closely the idea of the paternal relation to the people than had ever been since the time of the patriarchs of the elder days.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Each little clause of this verse is replete with interest. The royal giver, who now dealt to every one of Israel, was, after all, but a channel; yes, and only one channel, through which the fulness and the bounty of the royal Giver of every good and perfect gift, of all good whatsoever, of all things necessary to life and godliness, are supplied to every one of his creature-subjects. But it is highest honour, as servant and instrument alone, to figure forth him in any way. The second little clause tells us either that women took a recognized place on occasion of this joyous festival, or that the hospitality of such an occasion did not forget them and their homes. And the following three little clauses require closer examination. The word here translated \"loaf\" in the expression loaf of bread is כִּכַּר, for which in this sense we may turn to Exodus 29:23; Judges 8:5; 1 Samuel 2:36; 1 Samuel 10:3; Proverbs 6:26; Jeremiah 37:21. The corresponding word, however, in the parallel place is חַלַח (for which see Exodus 29:2, 23; Leviticus 2:4; Leviticus 7:12, 13; Leviticus 8:26; Leviticus 24:5; Numbers 6:15, 19; Numbers 15:20). The essential meaning of the former word is a circle, hence applied to the cake because of its shape, and of the latter word perforation, hence applied to the cake because it was perforated. A good piece of flesh. This is the Authorized Version rendering of אֶשְׁפָּר, which occurs only in the parallel place and here. The Vulgate translates assatura bubulae carnis; the Septuagint, ἐσχαρίτη. The imagined derivation of the word from פָּר (ox) and אֵשׁ (fire), or from שָׁפַד (to burn), seems to be what has led to these translations, helped, perhaps, by the apparent convenience of adapting meat from the sacrifice to the bread. But Gesenius, Rodiger, Keil, and others prefer the derivation שָׁפַר (to measure), and they would render \"a measure\" of wine. And a flagon. This is the Authorized Version rendering of the original אֲשִׁישָׁה, found in the parallel place as well as here, and also in the only other places (two in number, and in the plural) where it occurs (Song of Solomon 2:5; Hoses 3:1). But there is no doubt, or but little, that the rendering should rather be \"dried, pressed cakes of raisins or grapes.\" It is then to be derived from the root אָשַׁשׁ (to press). The substantive has both masculine and feminine form in plural. The Vulgate translates similam frixam oleo, which means a \"baked cake of flour and oil;\" and the Septuagint, λάγανον ἀπὸ τηγάνου in the parallel places. But here the Septuagint reads ἄρτον ε{να ἀρτοκοπικὸν καὶ ἀμορίτην ασ the whole account of the loaf, the good piece of flesh, and the flagon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - These verses contain a statement of the arrangement David made of a more permanent nature, but to date from this commencement, for the service of thanksgiving by the Levites. Verse 4. - To minister; i.e. to officiate, as we should say, in the service before the ark. The verse seems to describe what should be the essence of that service. It was threefold - to record, to thank, and to praise the Lord God of Israel. The word here used for \"record\" is the Hiph. of זָכַר (to remember), and is remarked upon by Gesenius as a title strictly appropriate to the character of the two psalms Psalms 38 and Psalms 70, on the head of which it stands, as meaning, \"to make others remember\" (see also such passages as Exodus 20:24; 2 Samuel 8:16; 2 Samuel 18:18; 2 Samuel 20:24; Isaiah 43:26; Isaiah 63:7). The minds of the people were to be refreshed in this service and in their very psalm of praise (so note in this sense vers. 8, 9, 12, 21, etc.), by being reminded or told, so far as the youngest of them might be concerned, of God's marvellous and merciful deeds for their forefathers of many, many a generation. Then they were to give intelligent and hearty thanks. And, lastly, they were to offer to approach that purest form of worship which consists in adoring praise. One might imagine with what zest they would have accepted, with what fervour they would have added lip and instrument of music to it - that one verse which needed the revolution yet of nearly another three thousand years, that it might flow from the devotion or' Addison.NEWLINENEWLINE\"When all thy mercies, O my God,NEWLINEMy rising soul surveys,NEWLINETransported with the view I'm lostNEWLINEIn wonder, love, and praise.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAsaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Obed-edom. No colon should follow this name. And the first time of the occurrence of the name Jeiel in this verse should probably have shown the Jaaziel of 1 Chronicles 15:18. The contents of this verse put us, then, into possession of this much, that Asaph presided (1 Chronicles 6:39) at this musical service, and that his instrument was the cymbals (1 Chronicles 15:19), with which time was kept; that Zechariah was next to him, and, with eight others formed a band, who played on psalteries (or lutes) and harps. If we may guide ourselves by vers. 20, 21 of the preceding chapter, three of these - viz. Mattithia, Jeiel, Obed-edom - performed on the harp, the other six on the psaltery, or lute.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBenaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Jahaziel.

David makes selections from four psalms already known; for it cannot be supposed that the verses we have here were the original, and that they were afterwards supplemented. The first fifteen verses (viz. 8-22) are from Psalm 105:1-15. The next eleven verses (23-33) are from Psalm 96:1-13; but a small portion of the first and last of these verses is omitted. Our thirty-fourth verse is identical with Psalm 107:1; Psalm 118:1; Psalm 136:1; and forms the larger part of Psalm 106:1. It is, in fact, a doxology. And our thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses consist of a short responsive (\"and say ye\") invocation, followed by another doxology. These are taken from Psalm 106:47, 48. Hereupon \"all the people\" are directed to find the final outburst of praise to Jehovah, and \"Amen.\" In the first of these selections (vers. 8-23) there is no material variation from the language of the psalm itself. Yet the original psalm has Abraham, where our own thirteenth verse reads Israel. And the original psalm uses the third person, where our fifteenth and nineteenth verses have the second person. In the second selection it is worthy of note that our ver. 29, \"Come before him,\" probably preserves the ante-temple reading, while Psalm 96:8 was afterwards, to fit temple times, altered into, \"Come into his courts.\" The arrangement of all the succeeding clauses does not exactly agree with the arrangement of them found in the psalm, as for instance in the latter half of our ver. 30 and in ver. 31, compared with the clauses of vers. 10,11 of the psalm. Again, one clause of the tenth verse of the psalm, \"He shall judge the people righteously,\" is not found in either alternative position open to it through the inversion of clauses, in our vers. 80, 81. The rhythm and metre of the psalm are, however, equally unexceptionable. The whole of the twenty-nine verses of this Psalm of praise (vers. 8-36 inclusive) are divided into portions of three verses each, except the portion vers. 23-27 inclusive which consists of five verses. As regards the matter of it, it may be remarked on as breaking into two parts, in the first of which (vers. 8-22) the people are reminded of their past history and of the marvellous providence which had governed their career from Abraham to the time they were settled in Canaan, but in the second (vers. 23-36) their thought is enlarged, their sympathies immensely widened, so as to include all the world, and their view is borne on to the momentous reality of judgment.

These are called mine anointed... my prophets, in harmony with what we read in the splendid passage, Exodus 19:3-6. The substitution in our vers. 15, 19 of the second person pronoun plural, in place of the third person of the psalm, helps speak the reality of this occasion and its dramatic correctness. The literal original of our Authorized Version in ver. 19, but few, even a few, is, men of number, i.e. men who could easily be numbered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-36. - The grandeur and unusual comprehensiveness of the adoration and homage here proclaimed, as to be offered to the omnipotent Ruler of all nations, should be well pondered. Our eye and ear may have become too familiar with it, but when put a little into relief, and referred to its original time of day, it is fit to be ranked among the strongest moral evidences of inspiration in the word and the speaker.

The suggestion in the midst of the unbounded gladness of this day is affecting, and must have been intended for salutary lesson and timely warning. In the midst of the fulness of praise and joy, the people are led to prayer - say ye - and the prayer is an humble petition for salvation, union, and protection from every enemy. God's treatment of his anointed people had been on his part one continued protection and one prolonged salvation. Yet they had often neither prayed for these nor acknowledged them. Now they are led again by the hand, as it were, to the footstool of the throne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever.

And the first of them may be considered to mark an important step in advance in the crystallizing of the world's ecclesiastical institutions. Asaph and his brethren of song are left there before the ark of the covenant... to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required. A permanent local ministry and choir are thus established, with a fixity of place on Zion, and regularity of time that had been hitherto unattainable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Obed-edom with their brethren. Explanation is needed of the plural pronoun \"their.\" Either another name is wanted with Obed-edom, or tacit reference is made to \"Asaph and his brethren,\" as though the name Asaph had not been followed in its own place by the clause \"and his brethren.\" Keil draws attention to the \"three score and two\" of 1 Chronicles 26:8, in connection with the three score and eight of this place; and it has been proposed to make up this number by some of the sons of Hosah, of our following verse and of 1 Chronicles 26:11. In this case the name Hesah might be the name missing before, \"and their brethren.\" Conjecture, however, has not sufficient clue here to warrant it, and the textual state of this verse must be debited with the obscurity. The ambiguity respecting the name Obed-edom has already (1 Chronicles 13:14) been alluded to. Neglecting this ambiguity, it may be repeated that Obed-edom,... son of Jedithun (as the Keri of this passage is) was a Merarite Levite, while Obed-edom son of Jeduthun (1 Chronicles 15:25) was of Gath-rimmon, a Gittite (2 Samuel 6:10-12; Joshua 21:24), a Kohathite (1 Chronicles 6:66, 69), and a Korhite (1 Chronicles 26:1-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - While those above-mentioned were to officiate before the ark on Zion, those mentioned in this and following verses are the officiating staff at Gibson. It is now brought into prominence that the ark and the tabernacle are in two separate places. The great ordinary sacrifices and services, \"all that is written in the Law of the Lord,\" are carefully observed on the original altar (Exodus 38:2) in the tabernacle. Other and special sacrifices evidently were offered in the presence of the ark. The tabernacle erected in the wilderness was first stationed at Shiloh (Joshua 18:1; 1 Samuel 4:3, 4). The occasion of its removal to Nob (1 Samuel 21:1; 1 Samuel 22:19) is not narrated. The present passage first tells us where it had been since the slaughter of the priests at Saul's command by Doeg the Edomite. Some distinct statement, like that of 1 Chronicles 21:29 and 2 Chronicles 1:3, might have been expected here. Zadok the priest is given (1 Chronicles 6:4-9) as in the line of Eleazar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - To offer burnt offerings; i.e. the customary morning and evening sacrifices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 41, 42. - Comparing these verses with vers. 4-6 and 37-40, it may be supposed that we are intended to understand that of all who were set apart and who had been expressed by name (as e.g. 1 Chronicles 15:4-24), some were now formally appointed to serve before the ark, and some in the tabernacle at Gibeon. The confusion existing in these verses by the repetition of the preposition with, and the proper names Heman and Jeduthun, betrays some corruptness of text. The Septuagint does not show them in the latter verse. The sons of Jeduthun are found in 1 Chronicles 25:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles16:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God.

David's thoughts respecting the honour due to God and to the ark of the covenant had time to grow into convictions, and they were greatly and rightly stimulated by reflection on his own surroundings of comfort, of safety, of stability and splendour. He revolves the possible methods and the right methods of showing that honour due. The completion of his own house, one presumably fit for the permanent abode of the King of Israel (1 Chronicles 14:1), is the clear demonstration to him that the ark should not dwell in a mere tent. It is a true touch of life, when it is written that as David sat in his house these thoughts possessed him, and so strongly. The exact time, however, here designed, and the exact occasion of his revealing the thoughts that burned within him, to Nathan, do not appear either here or in the parallel place. In the opinion of some, an indication of some interval having elapsed is found in the words (2 Samuel 7:1), \"The Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies;\" while others consider those words to refer to the victories gained over the Philistines, as recorded in ch. 14. Nathan the prophet. This name suddenly breaks upon us, without any introduction, here for the first time. Nathan is emphatically entitled \"the prophet,\" but perhaps merely to distinguish him from Nathan, David's eighth son. Amid many other important references to Nathan, and which speak for themselves, must be specially noted 1 Chronicles 29:29; 2 Chronicles 9:29. And it will be noticed from the former of these references, in particular how Nathan is the prophet (הַגָּבִיא); not (like Samuel and Gad) seer (הָרֹאֶה or הַתוֶה). Possibly he is intended in 1 Kings 4:5. An house of cedars. The cedar here spoken of does, of course, not answer to our red, odorous cedar. The word employed is אֶרֶז, in the plural number. The first Biblical use of this word is found in Leviticus 14:4, 6, 49-52. It is derived by Gesenius from an obsolete word אָרַז, from the grip and the firmness of its roots. It is probably the derived signification, therefore, that should be adhered to (as in the Authorized Version), and not the original, where in Ezekiel 27:24, the plural of the passive participial is found, \"made of cedar,\" not with A. Schultens, \"made fast.\" The cedar genus belonging to the order Coniferae, is odoriferous, very lasting, and without knots. The numerous good qualities which it possesses are spoken to in the variety of uses, and good kind of uses, to which it was put - these all crowned by the almost solitary spiritualized appropriation of the tree, found in Psalm 92:12. From a comparison of 1 Kings 5:6, 8 (in the Hebrew, 20, 22) with 2 Chronicles 2:3, 8, and some other passages, we may be led to believe that the cedar as the name of timber was used occasionally very generically. Nevertheless, the very passages in question instance by name the other specific kinds of wood. Two of the chief kinds of cedar were the Lebanon and the Deodara, which is said not to have grown in Syria, but abounds in the Himalayas. And as the use of the Lebanon cedar for some purposes (e.g. for the masts of ships) is almost out of the question, it is exceedingly probable that this Deodars and some other varieties of pines are comprehended under the eh-rez. Dean Stanley points out what may be described as very interesting moral landmark uses of the celebrated cedars of Lebanon, in those passages which speak of Solomon's sweep of knowledge, commencing in the dewing direction from them (1 Kings 4:33), of the devouring fire that should begin with the bramble and reach high up to those cedars (in Jotham's parable, Judges 9:15), and (in the parable of Joash, King of Israel, to Amaziah, King of Judah, 2 Chronicles 25:18) of the contempt with which the family of the cedars of Lebanon is supposed to hear of the matrimonial overtures of the family of the thistles of Lebanon. Stanley's pages ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 414-414d) are full of interest on the subject of the cedars of Lebanon (see also full article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:285, 286; and Dr. Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' pp. 197-200). Cedar was the choice wood for pillars and beams, boarding and ceiling of the finest houses; and alike the first and second temples (Ezra 3:7) depended upon the supply of it. Under curtains. Here rightly in the plural, though our parallel (2 Samuel 7:2) shows the singular (Exodus 26:1-13; Exodus 36:8-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This verse gives Nathan's response on the spur of the moment. And that it was not radically wrong from a prophet may be inferred from the stress afterwards laid upon the acceptableness to God of what had been in the heart of David to do. Even with God, silence would sometimes be understood by a prophet to be equivalent to assent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The express word of God came, however, that same night. It proved to be an overruling word. But it brought with it the point of a fresh and most welcome new departure for David. We might glean here by the way a suggestion of the beneficent operation of express revelation, superseding the thought, the method, the reason of man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-15. - These verses are the unfolding to David of the magnificent and far-stretching purposes of God's grace towards him in his son Solomon and his descendants for ever. The revelation is made by the mouth of Nathan. Verse 4. - Thou shalt not build. The Hebrew marks the personal pronoun here as emphatic,\" Not thou shalt build,\" i.e. but some one else. In the parallel this prohibition is conveyed by that interrogative particle which expects the answer No, and may be thus translated: \"Is it thou shalt build for me,\" etc.?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This verse contains the three terms - house, tent, tabernacle (see notes on 1 Chronicles 16:1). Gesenius observes that when the Hebrew of the last two words is used distinctively, the tent describes the outer coverings of the twelve curtains; and the tabernacle, the ten inner curtains and framework as well, in other words, the whole equipment of the well-known tabernacle. As compared with the version we have here, the parallel place speaks an almost pathetic condescension, \"I was a shifting traveller in tent and tabernacle.\" God meant to remind David how surely and faithfully he had shared the pilgrim lot and unsettledness of his people. What most holy the tabernacle contained was herein a type of the bodily tabernacle of Jesus Christ in later times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The judges of Israel. The substitution of the Hebrew character beth for pe, in the word \"judges,\" would make it \"tribes,\" and bring it into harmony with the parallel place. But the succeeding clause, Whom I commanded to feed my people, would rather suggest that the parallel place, which adds the same clause, should be brought into harmony with this (see again ver. 10 of this chapter). The general meaning and the gracious spirit underlying it is evident enough. God had never made a suggestion to tribe, or leader of tribe, nor to judge, who had been temporarily raised up to lead, and so to feed, all his people Israel, to build him an house. He had shared their lot, and had shared it unmurmuringly. He also \"had not opened his mouth\" (1 Kings 8:12-16; 1 Chronicles 28:3, 4; Psalm 78:67-71). Note also the expression, \"I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel\" (1 Kings 8:16). It is to be remarked that we learn from 1 Chronicles 22:8 and 1 Chron 28:3 the fuller causes why David was not to be permitted to be the builder of the house. It is not apparent why those causes are not recited here. The same remark applies to the parallel place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I took thee. (So 1 Samuel 16:11, 12; 2 Samuel 7:8; Psalm 78:80.) The sheepcote. The Hebrew נָזֶה strictly signifies a resting or place of resting. Hence the habitation of men or of animals, and in particular the pasture in which flocks lie down and rest (Psalm 23:2, plural construction; Job 5:24; Hosea 9:13; Jeremiah 23:3; Jeremiah 49:20). The sheepcote was sometimes a tower, with roughly built high wall, exposed to the sky at the top, used for protection from wild beasts at night; sometimes the sheepfold was a larger low building of different shape, to which a fenced courtyard was adjacent, where the peril of cold or of wild beast was less imminent. The word of our present passage, however, cannot be compared with these places; comp. rather Exodus 15:13; 2 Samuel 15:25; Isaiah 33:20; Isaiah 65:10; Hosea 9:13, as above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And have made thee. This may be rendered and will make thee; in which ease the promise to David commences with this rather than the following clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All the verbs of this verse are in the same tense as those of the foregoing verse, which are correctly translated. For an expression similar to the last clause of the verse, Neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, may be found in Psalm 89:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This verse should read on continuously with the preceding, as far as to the word \"enemies.\" The time here denoted will stretch from the people's occupation of the laud to the death of Saul, as the expression, \"at the beginning,\" in ver. 9, will point to the experience of Egyptian oppression. Will build thee an house; i.e. will guarantee thee an unfailing line of descendants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The promise is now, not to \"David and his seed,\" but to David personally. The verse contains, no doubt, the original of the Apostle Peter's quotation (Acts 2:29, 30; see also Acts 13:34; Luke 1:32, 33). The last clause of this verse has Solomon, for the object of its pronoun \"his.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - The reference of these promises was also to Solomon, and to him they were faithfully fulfilled. They were early perceived to be prophecies also, and of the highest significance and application (Psalm 89:26-37; Isaiah 9:7; Isaiah 55:3, 4; Jeremiah 23:5, 6; Jeremiah 33:17-21; Zechariah 6:12, 13; Hebrews 1:5; Hebrews 3:6). The alternative of the \"son who commits iniquity\" (2 Samuel 7:14) is omitted from the middle of our thirteenth verse. The latter half of ver. 13 manifestly purports to say, \"I will not take my mercy away from Solomon, as I did take it away from Saul.\" The close of our fourteenth verse is in the parallel place (2 Samuel 7:16) distinctly referred to David, with the use of the second person possessive pronoun.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-27. - These verses contain David's response to the gracious communication which had been made to him, and thanksgivings for the promise made to him as regards his seed. His appreciation of the contents of that promise is expressed in a manner which would seem to indicate that he was not altogether untaught, even then, by the Spirit of some of the deeper significance of the far-reaching promise. Verse 16. - Sat before the Lord; i.e. before the ark. It has surprised many that it should be said that David sat before the Lord, in the act of prayer or devotion. But this was not altogether unusual (1 Kings 19:4) in the first place; and then, secondly, it is not quite clear that this is said. Possibly he sat awaiting first some such token as he might know how to construe into the presence of Jehovah, and into his gracious vouchsafing to give him audience, and thereupon he may have altered his attitude. Confessedly, however, the other is the morn natural reading.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - David here makes a clear sad very just difference between all that had been done for him, and the very great prospect now in addition put before him: Thou... hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree; i.e. thou hast treated me, or dealt with me, in this promise as though [ had been of high rank indeed. The parallel reading is very concise (2 Samuel 7:19), and perhaps somewhat obscure, \"And is this the manner [or, 'law'] of man?\" or, \"And this is to be a law of man,\" i.e. this continuity of a great while to come. Elliptical as this reading may seem, there is no real difficulty in feeling its essential harmony with the passage before us. David's unfeigned surprise and joy in the \"great while to come\" nature of the promises made to him and his house overpower all else in his estimation. It is, indeed, a most opportune emphasis that he lays upon this element of the full promise, and accords exceptionally well with our later knowledge and brighter light. Our Authorized Version rendering throws out sufficiently this surprise, and gives not inadequately the drift of the passage. The continuity and exaltedness of the promise, which was only fully realized in the greater Son of David, the Christ, might well astonish David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Thy servant. The Septuagint Version has not got these words on their first occurrence. They may have found their way in wrongfully out of the next clause. They are not found in the parallel place. If they remain, they can mean nothing else than \"How can David further acknowledge the honour conferred on thy servant,\" - a sense by no means far-fetched.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For thy servant's sake. The parallel place reads, \"For thy word's sake.\" This reading is superior, and well suits the connection, suggesting also whether the first occurrence of the word \"servant\" in the previous verse might not be similarly explained. The similarity of the characters of the words in the Hebrew would render easy the exchange of the one word for the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - In the parallel verse (2 Samuel 7:23), our Authorized Version, following the Hebrew text (לְכֶם), reads, \"To do for you great things and terrible.\" The transition is awkward, no way in harmony with the other short clauses of the passage, and it would be inexplicable except for the alternative open to us, of regarding it as a quotation from Deuteronomy 4:34, brought in regardless of the context into which it was introduced. The difficulty does not meet us in our present passage, being obviated by the other sentences of our compiler. Both places, however, manifestly quote from the Book of Deuteronomy, with the grand passages and grand verbiage of which we may well imagine David familiar. A similar familiarity is also betokened in the following verses, as regard other Pentateuchal passages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Didst thou make.

The \"established\" in the last clause of the verse is not the same word with that used here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles17:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The marginal, It hath pleased thee, is the correcter rendering of the Hebrew here, though the parallel place exhibits the imperative mood. That it may be before thee for ever. The fulfilment of these words can be found in the Messiah alone (comp. Psalm 2:6-12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines; literally, her daughters. The compiler of Chronicles gives us this plain statement where, in the parallel place, we find, \"took Metheg-ammah,\" or more exactly, Metheg-ha-ammah, the explanation of which word (see 2 Samuel 8:1) is not yet ascertained. Its literal signification is \"the bridle or curb of the mother city,\" and may mark a special strong position which commanded Gath, or it may describe Gath as owning itself to such a position. Gesenius understands it to mean that David \"subjected the metropolis of the Philistines to himself,\" quoting the Arabian proverb, To give one s bridle to any one, as equivalent to submitting to him. He quotes also Job 30:11. It may be noted that Ammah is spoken of (2 Samuel 2:24) as the name of a hill, otherwise unknown, however. Although David subdued so many places, he reigned over them, i.e, over many of them, still by \"their own kings\" (1 Kings 4:24; 2 Chronicles 9:26). Hence we find Gath with a king still in 1 Kings 2:39.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Brought gifts; i.e. in the light of tribute and of acknowledgment of subjection. There are curious additions to this passage in the parallel place, telling the punishment inflicted on Moab: \"He smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground [i.e. causing them to lie prostrate]; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.\" This appears to mean that he put to death two parts of them, and kept the third part alive. The reason of this deliberate and severe punishment is not stated. Once David and the Moabites had been on very different terms (1 Samuel 22:3, 4; but see also Psalm 60:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Hadarezer; in the parallel places, Hadadezer; though our present form is found both in Samuel (e.g. 2 Samuel 10:16) and in other places in Chronicles, yet in all these places some manuscripts show Hadadezer (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub voce). Zobah. Part of Syria, east of Hamath, and for the most part of Coelo-Syria, north of Damascus, and stretching in the direction of the Euphrates. Possibly it is one with Ptolemy's Zake (1 Samuel 14:47; 2 Samuel 8:3-10; 2 Samuel 10:9; 1 Kings 11:23-25). Hamath. In the valley of the Orontes, the northern boundary of the Holy Land. It is traceable from the time of the Exodus (Genesis 10:18; Numbers 13:21; Numbers 34:8) to that of the Prophet Amos (Amos 6:12). Though in Zobah, it is probably not the Hamath-Zobah of 2 Samuel 8:3. To stablish his dominion. In the parallel place, \"to restore,\" i.e., no doubt, to endeavour to do so, and that against the growing force of David. He had already suffered at the hand of Saul (1 Samuel 14:47, 48).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The parallel place (2 Samuel 8:4) omits, probably by error merely, the word \"chariots,\" and reads for our seven thousand, \"seven hundred.\" As the form of expression in the last two clauses of our present verse is the same in both cases, it is more natural to render, David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved a hundred, i.e. a hundred horses unhoughed; he houghed all but a hundred. Our Authorized Version, in the parallel, gets over the difficulty by inserting \"for,\" i.e. enough for, \"a hundred chariots.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Hebrew text of Damascus, here, next verse, and also 2 Chronicles 28:5, spells the word with a resh, omitting the dagesh forte in the mere following, which Gesenius instances (see his 'Lexicon') as the Syriac orthography.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - the word \"garrisons\" appears in the text in the parallel place, and would be justly supplied in our Hebrew text here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The shields; Hebrew שֶׁלֶט. Much doubt has been entertained as to the meaning of this word. Its etymology is uncertain. Gesenius derives it from a root signifying \"hardness.\" For the most part, however, the context of the seven places of its occurrence which he instances (2 Samuel 8:7; 2 Kings 11:10; 1 Chronicles 18:7; 2 Chronicles 23:9; Song of Solomon 4:4; Jeremiah 51:11; Ezekiel 27:11) favour the rendering \"shields,\" though the quotation from Jeremiah 51:11 (literally, \"fill ye the shields\") is not so satisfactory. The wealth of Zobah is, of course, illustrated by these shields of gold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Tibhath, and... Chun. These names replace Betah and Berothai in the parallel place, in the former case with possibility of orthographic explanation, but not in the latter. The purpose for which David was glad to take their brass is not mentioned in Samuel, but only here. The brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass (see 1 Kings 7:14-47; 2 Chronicles 4:1-18). In this latter place these subjects will be found treated more fully. This so-called \"brazen sea\" (אתֵ־יָם הַגְּחשֶׁת) took the place in Solomon's temple of (he earlier brazen laver (כִּיּור גְחשֶׁת) of the Mosaic ritual (Exodus 30:17-21; Leviticus 8:10, 11; 1 Kings 7:38). It is now called a sea, because of its large size. The use of the original laver is plainly told, for the priests to wash at it their hands and feet before offering sacrifices. It stood in the court of the tabernacle, between the altar and the door. The ten lavers of Solomon's temple were used for washing the sacrificial victims themselves (2 Chronicles 4:6). The brazen sea (which was rather of copper than brass, however) rested upon twelve standing oxen, three turning their faces to each quarter of the heavens. Its height was five cubits, its diameter ten cubits, the thickness of its metal a handbreadth, and its capacity variously given at two thousand baths (1 Kings 7:26) or three thousand (2 Chronicles 4:5). It was removed from its supports of oxen by Ahaz (2 Kings 16:17), and placed on a pedestal of stone. And it was eventually destroyed by the Assyrians (2 Kings 25:13). And the pillars. (For these pillars of the porch, named Jachin and Boaz, see 1 Kings 7:15-22; 2 Chronicles 3:15-17.) And the vessels of brass. (For these, see 1 Kings 7:40-51; 2 Chronicles 4:16-18.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Tou.

Nothing else is known of this King of Hamath, who now proffers his congratulations to David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hadoram. In the parallel place written Joram. The Septuagint has the name spelt with d in both places, which has led to the suggestion that possibly the real name was Jedorum. Josephus suggests that Tou had been brought into subjection by Hadadezer, and wished by his present congratulations and valuable gifts to ingratiate himself with David for a purpose. Had war; literally, was a man of war; i.e. he had shown his addictedness to war, or had warred abundantly with Tou. It is evident that Tou had generally fared the worst in their encounters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThem also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - From Edom. This is probably the correct reading, and not, as in the parallel, \"from Aram,\" unless, as some think, both places were named in the original authority. From the children of Ammon. Perhaps the events narrated in our succeeding chapter are here referred to by the compiler. From Amalek (see 1 Samuel 30:1-20, 26-31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Abishai... slew of the Edomites. The parallel place omits to say that it was by aid of Abishai that David slew these eighteen thousand Edomites. They are there called Syrians, which reading is at all events in keeping with the Aram of the previous verse. Abishai, here named son of Zeruiah, possibly served under \"Joab son of Zeruiah\" (ver. 15), who is spoken of (1 Kings 11:15, 16) as very trenchant in this Edomite war, without any mention being made of Abishai. Psalm 60. (title) probably speaks of an instalment of the eighteen thousand spoken of here, as the nation now suffered all but extermination. The valley of salt. Situate in Edom (1 Kings 11:14-17; 2 Kings 14:7; 2 Chronicles 25:11). The word here used for \"valley\" is גֵּיא (Psalm 23:4), not the more generic word עֵמֶק, and signifies rather \"ravine.\" The phrase occurs twice with the article expressed, גֵיא םחמֶּלָח. The place is celebrated also for the achievements of Amaziah (in references just given), who proceeded hence with ten thousand prisoners, to precipitate them down the cliff, i.e. Petra (הַסֶּלַע, 2 Chronicles 25:12). The real situation of this place is still doubtful. Since the time of the German traveller Geethen ('Reisen,' 2:356), and of Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:109), it has been generally assumed to be a tract of land extending some six miles south of the Dead Sea, and bounded at that distance by the range of hills which there runs across the country; but beside the consideration that the word \"ravine\" could not describe that tract of country, there are others very unfavourable to the supposition (see these carefully stated by Grove, in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1097).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants.

The word is of the same root with that in 1 Chronicles 16:4, \"to record.\" The exact duties and position of this officer are not stated in any one place, but may be gathered from 2 Samuel 8:16; 2 Samuel 20:24; 1 Kings 4:3; 2 Kings 18:18, 37; 2 Chronicles 34:8. From these notices, belonging to somewhat separate times, we may gather the dignity and responsibility and trust of the office which the recorder filled, altogether in excess of his duty as mere historical secretary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Abimelech the son of Abiathar. The reading in the parallel place is, \"Abimelech the son of Abiathar,\" as also in 1 Chronicles 24:6; but comparison of 1 Samuel 22:20; 2 Samuel 20:25; 1 Kings 1:7, 8, suggests that the right reading would be \"Abiathar the son of Ahimelech.\" With this Mark 2:26 agrees, and tells of a correct manuscript, from which, indirectly, the quotation came. Shavsha. The parallel place reads Seraiaha; 2 Samuel 20:25 reads Sheva; and 1 Kings 4:3 reads Shisha. The differences are probably due simply to errors of transcription. Scribe. The historical development of this title is obscure, and not easy to trace. The use of some form or other of the root is abundantly frequent from the times of the earliest parts of Scripture, in the sense of \"numbering,\" or \"declaring,\" or \"recording.\" Perhaps our title of \"secretary\" would answer sufficiently to it, and all the better, because the Old Testament scribes were also of different leading kinds, like in some degree to our various secretaries of state. There was the kind of scribe of Judges 5:14 - where our Authorized Version is far from the mark, and should rather read \"the staff of the scribe,\" in place of \"the pen of the writer\" - a military officer, whose duty it was to keep the muster-roll. There was the scribe of 2 Kings 25:19 - a passage which throws light on the former (see also Isaiah 33:18; Jeremiah 52:25). There were the scribes of a more literary, lawyer-like, or clerk-like kind, as here, and in the parallel place, and in 2 Samuel 20:25; 1 Kings 4:3; 1 Chronicles 2:55. In the time of Hezekiah, if not before, the scribes became distinctly a class of men (Proverbs 25:1; Jeremiah 8:8); and the times of the Captivity greatly enlarged their importance. Their exact duties in the best times of the monarchy are not laid down, but the dignified place the king's scribe held is evident from the company in which he is placed here and in the parallel passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Benaiah the son of Jehoiada (see 1 Chronicles 11:22-25; 1 Chronicles 12:27; 2 Samuel 23:20-23). The Cherethites and the Pelethites. Two tribes of Philistines whom David attached. The meaning and derivation of these two names leave it possible to translate them at once, and to read, \"the public executioners, and the public couriers,\" not treating them as proper names, and to this course Geseuius (see 'Lexicon') gives his sanction. On the other hand, a comparison of 1 Samuel 30:14 and 2 Samuel 15:18 would lead us to treat them as the names of people, although the Pelethites are net as identifiable in this sense as the Cherethites and Gittites. Anyway, it is evident they were the special guard of the king, and were faithful to David and to Solomon after him. Their duties included those of the executioner or lictor, and the courier. They are frequently mentioned on special occasions of the king's moving, and of danger (2 Samuel 15:18; 2 Samuel 20:7, 23; 1 Kings 1:38, 44). Chief about the king. The Hebrew text here is הָרִאשֹׁגִים. The word used in the parallel place is כֹּחֲנִים, which signifies strictly \"priests,\" but sometimes more generally\" princes.\" This is, without doubt, the meaning of our text.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Nahash. It is possible that this may be the Nahash of 1 Samuel 11:1, 2 and 1 Sam 12:12, who, being signally defeated by Saul, may have been the more inclined to show partiality to David. But it would appear that nearly sixty years had elapsed, and if so, it must be held very unlikely, and would point to the conclusion that it was his son whose death is here in question. With this the statement of Josephus ('Ant.,' 6:05, § 3), would tally, which says that the Nahash of 1 Samuel 11. was killed in the destruction of the Ammonite army then wrought by Saul. Possibly the word \"Nahash\" was the official title of kings of the Ammonites (and, though considering its signification, i.e. serpent, scarcely a flattering one from a modern point of view, yet this is overruled by the association of the attribute of wisdom with the serpent in olden time, of which we have more than a trace in Matthew 10:16), as \"Pharaoh\" of kings of Egypt, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Because his father showed kindness to me. The instance of kindness here alluded to is not recorded. There may have been many opportunities and calls for it during David's persecuted life, and when the Ammonite king would feel a motive beyond any intrinsic goodness of heart to \"show kindness\" to the youth who was Saul's object of hatred. It is, however, very remarkable that we find a genuine kindliness towards David still cleaving to the succession of Ammonite kings, even after the events of this chapter (2 Samuel 17:27-29). Hanna. Nothing else is known of this Hanun. Though here the name of an Ammonite king, we find it in Nehemiah 3:13, 30, the name of two of those who helped repair the city. The Assyrian Inscriptions contain the name as that of a Philistine king, tributary to Tiglath-pileser (see 'Speaker's Commentary').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thinkest thou that David, etc.? The Hebrew is, \"In thine eyes doth David?\" The order of to overthrow, and to spy out is reversed in Samuel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The classical scholar will not fail to be reminded, so far as the shaving here spoken of is concerned, of the account contained in Herodotus, 2:121. The parallel place makes the resemblance close, in that it tells us that \"one-half of their beards\" was shaved. To shave them was an affront to their customs, dignity, and religion: to shave them half added mockery; and to cut off half their garments completed the tale of ignominious and contemptuous insult (Isaiah 20:4). The beard was held almost in reverence by Easterns.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen there went certain, and told David how the men were served.

The Hebrew root of very strong force, בָּאשׁ, is here employed, and which our Authorized Version translates, both in the parallel place and elsewhere, far more uncompromisingly than here. A thousand talents. Not stated in Samuel. This talent was of three thousand shekels, believed to be equivalent to f 342. Mesopotamia. The parallel place has Aram-beth-rehob, instead of our Aram-naharaim (\"Syria of the Two Rivers,\" i.e. Tigris and Euphrates; Authorized Version, \"Mesopotamia\"). From comparing this verso with ver. 16, it may seem probable that those strictly called \"of Mesopotamia\" lent either no aid at first or but very partial. It is observable that the numbers of men supplied by Beth-rehob, Zobah, and Ishtob in the parallel place (viz. thirty-two thousand) agree with the numbers of this verse, from which we may conclude that, whatever Aram-beth-rehob (probably either Reho-both on the Euphrates, or Rehob last of Lebanon) and Aram-naharaim may strictly stand for respectively, they here substantially mean the same. It is possible that the difference is that of a corrupt text or careless copying. The Aram-naharaim (Mesopotamia), which comes before us first in Genesis 24:10, passes out of Scripture language after the defeats of this chapter - the tract of country which it designated (some seven hundred miles by twenty to two hundred and fifty) being absorbed, first by Assyria, and afterwards by Babylon. The Assyrian Inscriptions reveal the fact that Mesopotamia was the prey of a largo number of small separate tribes at the period of the judges and the early Jewish monarchy, which is quite consistent with the glimpses we here get of it and its people. Aram-maachah probably designates the tract of country north of East Manasseh, bordering on Palestine, and bounded by the Jordan, Mount Hermon, and on its east, Salcah. Zobah (see 1 Chronicles 18:3, note; 1 Samuel 14:47). The parallel place adds also \"the men of Ishtob.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.

Clearly a stop should follow the numeral, which designates the number of the men under arms. Medeba. Some four miles south-cast of Heshbon (Numbers 21:30; Joshua 13:9, 16; Isaiah 15:2), or others give it as nine miles.

He took the flower of all, under his own command, to face the Syrians in the field, who were the most formidable of the enemy. The rest he put under his brother Abishai, to face the Ammonites at the gate, i.e. of the city Medeba. The plan succeeded, for if Abishai had only done as much as hold back the Ammonites awhile, so soon as they saw the Syrians break and flee they knew that Joab and his army would be free to \"help\" Abishai.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city.

This is equivalent to saying that, for what he deemed sufficient reasons, Joab did not stay to besiege the Ammonites in the city, within the wails of which they had taken refuge, nor to pursue the Syrians. Hence we find these latter soon made bold to rally and to get additional aid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Beyond the river; i.e. the river Euphrates.

LIST OF GENERATIONS FROM ADAM TO NOAH. These verses contain a line of genealogical descents, ten in number, from Adam to Noah, adding mention of the three sons of the latter. The stride from Adam to Seth, and the genealogy's entire obliviousness of Cain and Abel, are full of suggestion. All of these thirteen names in the Hebrew and in the Septuagint Version, though not those in the Authorized Version, are facsimiles of those which occur in Genesis 5. They are not accompanied, however, here, as they are there, by any chronological attempt. Probably the main reason of this is that any references of the kind were quite beside the objects which the compiler of this work had in view. It is, however, possible that other reasons for this chronological silence may have existed. The uncertainities attaching to the chronology found in Genesis, as regards this table, may have been suspected or evident - uncertainties which afterwards proclaim themselves so loudly in the differences observable between the Hebrew, Samaritan, and Septuagint versions. Thus the Hebrew text exhibits the total aggregate of years from Adam to the birth of Noah, as amounting to one thousand and fifty-six; the Samaritan version to seven hundred and seven only; and the Septuagint to as many as sixteen hundred and sixty-two; nevertheless, all three agree in adding five hundred years onward to the birth of Shem, and another hundred years to the coming of the Flood. It must be remarked of this first genealogical table, whether occurring here or in Genesis, that, notwithstanding its finished appearance, notwithstanding the impression it undoubtedly first makes on the reader, that it purports to give all the intervening generations from the first to Shem, it may not be so; nor be intended to convey that impression. It is held by some that names are omitted, and with them of course the years which belonged to them. There can be no doubt that this theory would go far to remove several great difficulties, and that some analogies might be invoked in support of it, from the important genealogies of the New Testament. The altogether abrupt opening of this book - a succession of proper names without any verb or predication - cannot be considered as even partially compensated by the first sentence of ch. 9, \"So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.\" This verse applies directly to the genealogies of Israel and the tribes, beginning ch. 2:1, while under any circumstances, we must look on the first portion of this book as a series of tables, here and there slightly annotated, and suddenly suspended before the eyes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKenan, Mahalaleel, Jered,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHenoch, Methuselah, Lamech,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNoah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - B. LIST OF SONS AND GRANDSONS OF JAPHETH. After the mention of Noah's three sons, in the order of their age (though some on slender ground think Ham the youngest), this order, as in Genesis 10:2, is reversed; and the compiler, beginning with Japheth, the youngest, apparently with the view of disposing of what his purpose may not so particularly require, gives the names of seven sons and seven grandsons, viz. three through Gomar, the eldest son, and four through Javan, the fourth son. These fourteen names are identical in the Authorized Version with the list of Genesis 10:2-4. The Septuagint, though not identical in the spelling of the four names Madai, Tiras, Tarshish, and Kittim, shows no material differences in the two places. In the Hebrew, according to the text and edition consulted, very slight variations are found in the orthography of Tubal (וְתֻבָּל here for וְתֻבָל) and Tarshish (וְתַרְשִׁישָׁח here for וְתַרְשִׁישׁ)and in the adoption of Riphath and Dodanim in this book for Diphath and Rodanim. The names Kittim and Dodanim look less like names of individuals than of such family, tribe, or nation as descended from the individual. At the close of this short enumeration, we have in Genesis the statement, \"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\" It is evident here also that, whether the compiler borrowed from the Book of Genesis itself, or from some common source open to both, his objects are not exactly the same. Time and the present position and condition of that part of his people for which he was writing governed him, and dictated the difference. Accordingly we do not pause here on the colonizings and the fresh seats and habitations of the sons and grandsons of Japheth. The subject, one of extreme interest, and the threads of it perhaps not so hopelessly lost as is sometimes thought, belongs to the place in Genesis from which the above verse is cited. It may, however, be written here that the rather verbose disquisitions of Joseph Mede are neither altogether unin-retorting nor in some parts of them unlikely. They form Discourses 47, 48, bk. 1. (edit. 'The Works of Joseph Mode.' London, 1664).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Gomer; Ashchenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-16. - C. LIST OF THE SONS, GRANDSONS, AND GREAT-GRANDSONS OF HAM. This list consists of four sons of Ham, of six grandsons, including Nimrod, through Cush, the eldest son of Ham; of seven grandsons through Mizraim, the second son of Ham; of eleven grandsons through Canaan, the fourth son of Ham; of two great-grandsons through Raamah, Cush's fourth son; - thirty descendants in all. No issue is given of Put, the third son of Hem. The parallel list is found in Genesis 10:6-20. The names agree in the Authorized Version, with minute differences, e.g. Put here for Phut there, and so the Philistines for Philistine, Caphthorim for Caphtorim, Girgashite for Girgasite. They are similarly in agreement in the Hebrew text of the two places, with minute differences, e.g. וְסַבְתָּא here for וְסַבְתָּה there; וְרַעְמָא for וְרַעְמָה for לוּדיִים וְרַעְמָה for צִידון לוּדיִים for הַעַרְקִי צִידֹן. However, in Genesis the following statements are added to Nimrod's name: - \"He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty. hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city.\" And again, at the close of the enumeration of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons, follow the statements, \"And afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comsat to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

Also after this description of Nimrod, it proceeds to the enumeration of the posterity of Shem, omitting all mention of Ham's grandsons through Mizraim and Cainan. Up to that point the names in this book and Genesis are in agreement in the Septuagint Version. It is evident that some of the names in this portion of the genealogy are not strictly those of the individual, but of the tribe or nation which came to be, as, for instance, Mizraim, Ludim, the Jebusite, the Amorite, and so on.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (of whom came the Philistines,) and Caphthorim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and Heth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Jebusite also, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - This verse furnishes us with one illustration of the assertion made above, that the clues to the ethnological and ethnographical statements of these most ancient records are not necessarily all hopelessly lost. In the name Zemarite, it is suggested by Michaelis, that we have allusion to the place Sumra, on the west coast of Syria, this Sumra being the Siniyra of Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 5:20), and of the Spanish geographer of the first century, Pomponius Mela (1. 12). But the place Zimira, in company with Arpad, is found in the Assyrian inscriptions of Sargon, n.o. 720, leaving little cause to hesitate in accepting the identification of Michaelis (Courier's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 233). Certainty, however, cannot be felt on the subject.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-27. - D. THE LIST OF SHEM'S DESCENDANTS TO ABRAM. This list is broken in two; it pauses a moment exactly halfway to Abram, at the name Peleg, to mention Peleg's brother Joktan and Joktan's thirteen sons. Then, repeating the first five names of lineal descent, and picking up the thread at Peleg, the list gives the remaining five to Abram. In the first half of this list, we have apparently the names of nine sons of Shem, but, as Genesis explains, really the names of five sons, and through Aram, the last of them, the names of four grandsons. Another grandson, through Arphaxad the third son, follows, and through this grandson two consecutive lineal descents bring us, in the name Peleg, half-way to Abram. It is here the lineal table pauses to give Joktan and his thirteen sons. The names then in this portion of the list are twenty-six in number. In the Authorized Version they correspond with those in Genesis, except that Meschech (וָמֶשֶׁך) here is called Mash (וָמַשׁ) there; Shelah here is spelled Salah there; and Ebal (עֵיבָל) here is written Obal (עובָל) there. The difference between the Hebrew texts justifies the first and last of these variations in the Authorized Version, but in all other respects those texts are in entire accord with one another, for this paragraph. The Septuagint gives very little of this portion of the list. It corresponds, whether with the Hebrew or the Authorized Version, only as far as to the name Arphaxad, after which it carries down the line at once to Abram by the remaining eight names as given in our twenty-fourth to twenty-seventh verses. Nor is it in agreement with its own version in Genesis, which has points of important variation with the Hebrew text also. It is then at this break of the list that, after the names of Joktan's sons, we have in Genesis these words, \"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lauds, after their nations. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the Flood.\" Upon this follows the account of Babel, in nine long verses, and then a chronological summary is furnished in lineal descent only from Shem to Abram. It is with the names in this chronological summary that those in this second part of our list (vers. 24-27) are found to agree. But any attempt at reproduction of the chronology found in Genesis is again absent here. At this point a significant stage of these genealogies is reached. The ever-broadening stream of population now narrows again. Two thousand years have flown by, then Abraham appears on the stream and tide of human life. Of that long period the life of Adam himself spanned nearly the half. So far we learn without partiality of all his descendants in common. But henceforth, the real, the distinct purpose of the genealogy becomes apparent, in that the line of the descendants of Abraham, and that by one family, alone is maintained, and proves to be a purpose leading by one long straight line to Christ himself. With Abraham \"the covenant of innoceney,\" long forfeited in Adam, is superseded by the everlasting \"covenant of grace,\" and we lose sight in some measure of Adam, the \"common father of our flesh,\" to think of a happier parentage found in Abraham, the \"common father of the faithful.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Arphaxad begat Shelah, and Shelah begat Eber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; because in his days the earth was divided: and his brother's name was Joktan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHadoram also, and Uzal, and Diklah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ebal, and Abimael, and Sheba,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab.

LIST OF THE SONS, GRANDSONS, AND OTHER DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM. In the first of these verses the new form of the name of Abraham is at once used in place of the old form. And the names of two of his sons are given, Isaac the son by Sarah, and Ishmael the son by Hagar, his Egyptian bondwoman. That these stand in the inverse order of their birth and age requires no explanation. The distinct and separate mention of these two sons, apart from all the others, is of course in harmony with Genesis 21:12, 13, \"In Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.\" Although stated in the first place in the order of importance, and Isaac takes precedence of Ishmael, the name of this latter and of his posterity are treated of first. To note each clear instance of this kind will guard us against inferring, in cases not clear, anything positive, one way or the other, respecting seniority merely from order. The order either of age or of historic importance may be given in the first instance, to be immediately reversed in favour of the order which shall enable the writer to clear out of his way the less important.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-31 contain the list of Ishmael's sons, twelve in number.

In the Septuagint we have Idouma, Choudan, Iettar here, for Douma, Choddan, and Ietur there. At the close of this list in Genesis we have joined on to \"these are the sons of Ishmael,\" the clauses, \"and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.

The sons are six; the grandsons, two by the son placed second in order, and five by the son placed fourth in order; in all thirteen names. But the passage in Genesis gives also three great-grandsons, through the second grandson. All the thirteen are in the Authorized Version identical in the two places and in the Hebrew text; but in the Septuagint slight differences occur, as Zembram, Iexan, Madam, Sobak, Soe, Daidan, Sabai, Opher, Abida, and Eldada here, for Zombran, Iezan, Madal, Iesbok, Soie, Dedan, Saba, Apheir, Abeida, and Eldaga there. It is carefully stated in Genesis 25:5, 6, after the enumeration of Keturah's children, and in spite of her having been called \"wife\" in the first verse, that \"Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his sou, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.

The sons of Isaac; Esau and Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34-37 lead us on to the descendants of Isaac, the more important branch of Abraham's family. It breaks again at once into two, Esau, the less important, treated of first; and Israel, reserved till we enter on ch. 2. Of Esau, the names of five sons are given; and of seven grandsons by the first in order, and four grandsons by the second in order of these sons. In Genesis 36:1-5 we have the names of the five sons of Esau, which correspond in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text exactly with those of this list. We have there in addition the names of their mothers respectively, who were \"daughters of Canaan,\" Adah of the Hittites, mother of the first; Bashamath of the Ishmaelites, mother of the second (and by these two lines came the seven and four grandsons); and Aholibamah of the Hivites, mother of the remaining three sons. The names correspond also in the Septuagint in the two places, with the minute differences of Eliphaz and Ieoul here, for Eliphas and Ieous there. Then follow the names of seven grandsons of Esau though his son Eliphaz, of whom the first five are found and in agreement (Genesis 36:11), with the exception of Zephi here for Zepho there, both in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text. But the sixth name here, Timna, is explained in Genesis as the name of a concubine of Eliphaz, by whom he had the son Amalek, who appears here as the seventh son. There can be no doubt that we come here upon a transcriber's error, and it would be easily amended if we read \"and by Timna, Amalek,\" vice \"and Timna and Amalek.\" If this be the correct account of the matter, the grandsons of Esau of course count one fewer here. These two names also tally in the Authorized Version and in the Hebrew text in the two places; while for all seven names the agreement in the Septuagint is exact, except that we read Gootham here for Gothom there. There remain, in ver. 37, four grandsons to Esau, by Reuel. Their names agree with Genesis in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint, except that this last reads Naches here for Nachoth there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Esau; Eliphaz, Reuel, and Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Eliphaz; Teman, and Omar, Zephi, and Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna, and Amalek.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Reuel; Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Seir; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38-42. - F. LIST OF DESCENDANTS OF SEIR. These verses contain the names of seven sons of Seir and one daughter, and of grandsons through every one of the seven sons, viz. two through Lotan the first, five through Shobal the second, two through Zibeon the third, one through Anah the fourth, four through Dishon the fifth, three through Ezar the sixth, and two through Dishan the seventh, - twenty-six names in all, or, including the one daughter, who is introduced as Lotan's sister, twenty-seven. The first question which arises is, who Seir was, now first mentioned here. He is called in Genesis 36:20 \"Seir the Horite,\" and the only previous mention of the name Seir in that chapter is in ver. 8, \"Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom;\" while we read in Genesis 14:6, \"The Horites in mount Self;\" in Genesis 32:3, \"To the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\" For anything we know of the person Self, then, we are confined to these two notices - that in Genesis 36:20 and the one in our text. The name signifies \"rough;\" and whether Seir. the person, took the name from Seir, the place (a mountain district, reaching from the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf), or vice versa, it would seem plain that the proper name belonged to the head of the tribe, which had become located there, and was, of course, not in the line of Abraham. This tribe, called Horites - Hori being the name of Seir's eldest grandson - or Troglodytes, acquired their name from hollowing out dwellings in the rocks, as at Petra. They were visited evidently by Esau: he married at least one of his wives from them; and his descendants, the Edomites, in due time dispossessed and superseded them (Deuteronomy 2:12). No doubt some were left behind, and contentedly submitted to the Edomites and became mingled with them. These considerations put together account for the introduction here of the names of Seir and his twenty-seven descendants, while the particulars of their genealogy, so far as here given, would lie easily to hand. The sons of Seir are called in Genesis also \"dukes\" (אַלּוּפֵי), a word answered to by the later \"sheikhs;\" and they are called \"dukes of the Horites,\" or \"the dukes of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Self.\" The twenty-six or twenty-seven names under notice agree in the Authorized Version entirely with those in Genesis 36:20-27, except that for Homam, Allan, Shephi, Amram, and Jakan here, we have Hemam, Alvan, Shepho, Hemdan, and Akau there. Also in the Hebrew the texts agree in the two places as regards these names, with the same exceptions. But in the Septuagint the names differ much more in the two places. Thus for Ωσὰρ, Δισάν (or Λισάν),Ἀλὼν Ταιβὴλ Σωφὶ Ωνάν, Αιθ Σωνὰν Δαισὼν Ἐμερὼν Ἀσεβὼν, Ἰεθρὰμ, and Ακάν here, we have Ἀσὰρ, Ῥισὼν Γωλὰμ Γαιβὴλ Σωφὰρ Ωμὰρ Ἀίε, Ἀνά Δησὼν Ἀμαδὰ Ἀσβὰν Ἰθρὰν, and Ἱουκάμ there. When the name of Anah is reached in Genesis, it is added, \"This was that Anah that found the mules [אֶת־הַיַּבִים, more probably 'hot springs,' as the finder of which Anah is supposed to have been called Beeri] in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon, his father.\" And again, when Dishon is mentioned as the son of Anah, there is added, \"And Aholi-bamah the daughter of Anah.\" Note is made of her name, no doubt, for the same kind of reason as Timna is mentioned above. Aholibamah (i.q. \"Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite,\" Genesis 26:34) enjoys notice inasmuch as she became the wife of Esau; and Timna, as she became the concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, and thereby the mother of Amalek.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Lotan; Hori, and Homam: and Timna was Lotan's sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Shobal; Alian, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shephi, and Onam.

These verses contain a list of kings who reigned in Edom, during a period expressly notified as anterior to the institution of kings in Israel. Some further point of practical use than has been yet ascertained may lie in the preservation of these snatches of Edom's history. Something surely hangs on the emphatic but otherwise gratuitous statement, that kings were unknown in Israel when this line reigned in Edom. It may turn out to cover the fulfilment of some obscure point of prophecy, or to subserve some important chronological purpose; but wedged in as it is, it cannot be permitted to count for nothing. That it stands in identical words in Genesis 36:31 increases not a little the attention to be paid to it. It has hence been asserted far too dogmatically, as by Spinoza, that the Book of Genesis was no work of Moses; or again, that the passage, in the course of some transcription of manuscripts, had found its way from Chronicles, through a marginal note, at last into the text of Genesis (see Kennicott). But these positions are only forced by the assumption that kings must have reigned in Israel before the sentence could have been written, which is an unnecessary assumption. Kings had been promised to Jacob (Genesis 35:11), as among his posterity, and had been prophesied of by Moses (Deuteronomy 28:36). It may have been that Edom, secure in her kings for generations, had been wont to make her boast of them. in comparison of and in presence of her neighbours, and the remark may have thence originated. Lastly, it has been correctly pointed out that the structure of the sentence in the original does not at all necessitate the suggestion (of which in the English Version there is confessedly the appearance), that kings had already been in Israel. At the same time, too great stress must not be laid upon this, for the slight alteration of translation that would suit the time for Genesis, would throw it out again for our text here, and yet the words of the original are identical. These kings are eight in number; the parentage or the land of each is given. It is to be noticed that the line of royalty is not hereditary, and that several dukes, or heads of tribes, or princes of districts, rule under the king. The names, whether of persons or places, agree in the Authorized Version as they occur here and in Genesis 36:31-39, except that Saul is here spelt Shaul, and that we have here Hadad and Pai for Hadar and Pan there. These two differences are occasioned by the Hebrew text, and are the only differences between the two Hebrew texts, except that חושָׁם here is given חֻשָׁם there, and that the incorrect spelling here of עֲיִות is found right (עֲוִית) in Genesis. The superfluous statement, Hadad died also, which begins our fifty-first verse, is not found in Genesis. In the Septuagint the variations between the two places are greater, as well as those from the Hebrew text in either place. Thus we have Asom, Gethaim, Sebla, Roboth, Balaennor, Achobor, Adad, here, for Asom, Getthaim, Samada, Robboth, Ballenon, Achobor, Arad, there. There is also an entire omission here of the name of the wife of the last king, with those of her mother and grandmother, all of which are given in the passage of Genesis, as found in the Hebrew text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel; Bela the son of Beor: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Bela was dead, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - It is not impossible that this Jobab is one with Job.

These, the remaining verses of ch. 1, appear to give a list of eleven dukes of Edom, emphasized apparently as \"the dukes of Edom,\" as though there were none before or after them. But see Genesis 36:15, 41, 43, the study of which can scarcely leave a doubt on the mind that this list is not one of persons but of places; e.g. \"the duke\" of the city, or region of \"Timnah,\" and so on. The places were dukedoms. The names of these verses, in both Authorized Version and Hebrew text, are an exact counterpart of those found in Genesis 36:40-43, except that Aliah here (so Allan, ver. 40) stands for Alvah in Genesis. In the Septuagint we have Golada, Elibamas, and Babsar here, for Gola, Olibemas, and Mazar there. Thus this first chapter contains those genealogical tables which concern the patriarchs from Adam up to Israel, spanning a stretch of some two thousand three hundred years, and embracing also tables of Edom and certain of the descendants of Edom up to the period of kings. The chapter contains not a single instance of a remark that could be described as of a moral, religious, or didactic kind. Yet not a little is to be learnt sometimes, not a little suggested, from omission and solemn silence as well as from speech; no more notable instance of which could perhaps be given, when we take into account time, place, and circumstances, than that already alluded to in the omissions involved in the following of the name of Seth upon that of Adam. The genealogies of this chapter, with their parallels in Genesis, are notable also for standing unique in all the world's writing, and far over all the world's mythology, for retracing the pedigree of the wide family of men, and especially of the now scattered family of the Jew, to its original. From the time of the close of our Chronicle genealogies, supplemented by the earliest of the New Testament, no similarly comprehensive but useful, ambitious but deliberately designed and successfully executed enterprise has been attempted. And as Matthew Henry has well said, since Christ came, the Jews have lost all their genealogies, even the most sacred of them, \"the building is reared, the scaffold is removed; the Seed is come, the line that led to him is broken off.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDuke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDuke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles1:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDuke Magdiel, duke Iram.

But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The fifteenth verse of the previous chapter stated that the discomfited Ammonites \"fled... and entered into the city,\" i.e. into Rabbah. Hither we now learn that, by the command of David (2 Samuel 11:1), Joab, at the \"return of the year,\" i.e. probably at the return of spring (Exodus 23:16; Exodus 34:22), brings the power of the army, and, after ravaging the country surrounding it, sits down to besiege Rabbah itself. The series of feasts, beginning in spring and ending in autumn, regulated the year. The sacred year began with the new moon that became full next after the spring equinox; but the civil year at the seventh new moon. This one verse illustrates in four several instances at fewest the advantage of having two versions of the same events, even though in this case in comparatively immaterial respects.NEWLINENEWLINE1. We here read that Joab wasted the country of the children of Ammon... and besieged Rabbah, in place of the less consistent reading of 2 Samuel 11:1, \"destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. We have here in the Hebrew the right word for \"kings\" (חַמְּלָכִים), instead of the word for \"angels\" (חמְלָאכִים), as in the parallel place.NEWLINENEWLINE3. While we read here that Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it, the parallel place, now shifted to 2 Samuel 12:27-29, tells of Joab's generosity (if it were this, and not fear or possibly somewhat tardy obedience to strict commands given on his commission), in his message to David, to repair to the spot immediately and share the glory of the reduction of the city, or be its nominal captor.NEWLINENEWLINE4. And, once more, while we read here that Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it, and yet read in the parallel place of the delay and the visit of David (with which the very first clause of our ver. 2, \"And David took,\" etc., is in perfect accord) and of David's nominal taking of the city, we find probably the just and inartificial explanation of all this in 2 Samuel 12:26-29. There we read more particularly that Joab sent word he had taken the \"city of waters,\" i.e. the lower part of the city (where a stream had its source, and no doubt supplied the city with water), which was very likely the key of the whole position,and called upon David to come up and \"encamp against the city and take it,\" i.e. the city, or citadel, which stood upon the heights north of the stream. Glimpses of this kind may suffice to convince us how rapidly a text, really correct, would melt away for us a very large proportion of the whole number of the lesser obstacles which often impede our path in the historical books of the Old Testament. At the time that kings go out. It was no doubt the case that, even in Palestine, the winter was often a period of enforced inactivity. Rabbah. Tim punishment of Ammou for the treatment of David's well-intended embassy of condolence is now about to be completed. The familiar root of Rabbah signifies multitudinous number, and, resulting thence, the greatness of importance. It was the chief city of the Ammonites, if not their only city of importance enough for mention. In five passages its connection with Ammon is coupled with its name (Deuteronomy 3:11; 2 Samuel 12:26; 2 Samuel 17:27; Jeremiah 49:2; Ezekiel 21:20), \"Rabbah of the children of Ammon.\" It has been conjectured to be the Ham of the Zuzim, or the Ashteroth Karnaim of the Rephaim (Genesis 14:5), of which latter theory there is some interesting evidence of a corroborating tendency at all events (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:985). Rabbah is the proper spelling of the word, except when in a constructive state, as in the above phrase. The relations of Moab and Ammon with Israel are full of interest. After the overthrow of Og, King of Bashan (Numbers 21:33), \"Moab and Ammon still remained independent allies south and cast of the Israelite settlements. Both fell before David - Moab, evidently the weaker, first; Ammon not without a long resistance, which made the siege and fall of its capital, Rabbah-ammon, the crowning act of David's conquests. The ruins which now adorn the 'royal city' are of a later Roman date; but the commanding position of the citadel remains; and the unusual sight of a living stream abounding in fish (2 Samuel 12:27; Isaiah 16:2) marks the significance of Joab's song of victory, 'I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters'\" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' 323, edit. 1866).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Found it to weigh a talent of gold. Two difficulties present themselves in this verse, viz. the reported weight of this crown, and the uncertainty as to what head it was from which David took it. Whatever was its weight, if David's head was able to sustain it for a minute or two, the head of the King of the Ammonites might also occasionally have borne it. Yet it would scarcely be likely that the King of the Ammonites would have so ponderous a crown (calculated at a weight of a hundred and fourteen pounds Troy, or a little more or less than one hundredweight) as one of ordinary wear, or that he would have one of extraordinary wear on his head precisely at such a juncture. Both of these difficulties will remove if we suppose that the Hebrew מַלְכָּם, instead of meaning their king, is the name of the Ammonitish and Moabitish idol (i.q. Moloch), and which we find (Authorized Version) in Zephaniah 1:5, and probably (though not Authorized Version) in Jeremiah 49:1, 3, and Amos 1:15. The Septuagint treats the word thus. The point, however, cannot be considered settled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Cut them with saws (so Hebrews 11:37). We have here the very doubtful (so far as regards its real signification) Hebrew word וַיָּשַׂר (and he cut) instead of וַיָּשֶׂם (he put). Probably it is nowhere else used in the sense of \"cutting,\" if it is here. Its ordinary sense is to rule or put into subjection. The parallel place (2 Samuel 12:31) corrects, in the word (Authorized Version) axes, our Hebrew text, which repeats the word for saw, though putting it in the plural, and which thereby shows וּבַמְּגֵרות, instead of וּבְמַגְזְרות. This last word means \"Axes\" or \"scythes,\" and is from the root גָזַרַ, to cut (2 Kings 6:4). It is found only in 2 Samuel 12:31, though it should appear here also. There is a fourth severity of punishment mentioned in the parallel place, that the people were \"made to pass through the brick-kilns,\" a form of torture possibly suggested by the own familiar cruelty of the Ammonites in \"making their children to pass through the fire to Moloch.\" However, in harmony with what is above said respecting the doubtfulness of the just signification of the verb וַיָּשַׂר, much uncertainty hangs over the interpretation of this verse. Instead of severity and needless cruelty on the part of David, it may rather set forth that he subjected them to hard tasks in connection with the cultivation of the soil and with the making of bricks. The saws and harrows and axes (or scythes) were awkward and unlikely weapons to be employed for the purpose of inflicting torture, when the ordinary weapons of battle and warfare were close at hand. This view, however, is contrary to the verdict, so far as the above Hebrew verb is concerned, of Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' p. 1326, and of Thenins, on this and the parallel passage. When such punishments were of the nature of torture, the cruelty was in some cases extreme. \"The criminal was sometimes sawn asunder lengthwise; this was more especially the practice in Persia. Isaiah, according to the Talmud-isis, was put to death in this wise by King Manasseh, 'Sanhedrin,' p. 103, c. 2; comp. Justin's dialogue with Trypho\" (Jahn's 'Sacred Antiquities,' p. 132, § 260, 7.). With saws. The word in the original is not in the plural. It occurs again only in the parallel place (2 Samuel 12:31) and in 1 Kings 7:9, both times in the singular. The teeth of Eastern saws then and now usually incline to the handle instead of from it. With harrows of iron. The only harrow known to have been used at this time consisted of a thick block of wood borne down by a weight, or on which a man sat, drawn over the ploughed land by oxen (Isaiah 28:24, 25; Job 39:10; Hosea 10:11), and the root of the Hebrew word expresses the idea of crushing or levelling the land. But our present word is very different, and is found only here and in the parallel place, with the word \"iron\" accompanying it, so as to be equivalent to a compound word, and appears to mean \"sharp instruments of iron,\" or sharp threshing instruments. The use of the former part of this phrase (1 Samuel 17:18) for cheeses is the only other instance of its occurrence. Saws should be \"axes,\" or \"scythes,\" as stated above, though it is not any of the three more ordinary words for \"axe\" (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For the Gezer (גֶזֶר) of this verse, the parallel place (2 Samuel 21:18) shows Gob (גוב), a name not known, but which careless transcription may have easily made out of the former. The Syriac Version, however, as well as the Septuagint, has Gath in that verse as well as in the two verses following (2 Samuel 21:18-20), another name also easily interchangeable in Hebrew characters with Gezer. The \"yet again\" of our ver. 6 would well accord with the supposition that the conflict with the Philistines was at Gath, or at the same place, each of the three times. Gezer belonged to Ephraim, and was situated to the north of Philistia (1 Chronicles 7:28; 1 Chronicles 14:16). Sibbechai (see also 1 Chronicles 11:29; 1 Chronicles 27:11). Sippai. In the parallel place spelt Saph. It is remarkable that, in the Peshito Syriac, over Psalm 143, is found the inscription,\" Of David, when he slew Asaph, the brother of Gulyad, and thanksgiving that he had conquered.\" Of the children of the giant. The Hebrew word for \"giant,\" rapha (always in these verses spelt with a final aleph, but in the parallel verses always with he final), is here (Authorized Version) translated. \"The Rapha, a native of Gath, was the forefather of the Canaanitish Rephaim, mentioned as early as Genesis 14:5; Genesis 15:20; Deuteronomy 2:11; Deuteronomy 3:11; Joshua 12:4; Joshua 15:8; Joshua 17:15. The slaying of Ishbi-benob (2 Samuel 21:16) is not here given. It is also to be observed that the lengthy account of Samuel, respecting Absalom and his rebellion (2 Samuel 13-21.) is not found here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Elhanan the son of Jair. In Samuel Jair appears as Jaare. This Elhanan is probably different from him of 1 Chronicles 11:26. There is a strange confusion in the reading of this and its parallel verse. If our present verse is to stand corrected by accepting from its parallel \"the Bethlehemite\" in place of our Lamhi, then either we have no name given for the brother of Goliath, the Gittite; or, if we drop the word \"brother\" (changing the אֲחי of Chronicles into the אֵת of Samuel), and make Goliath the Gittite the man slain by Elhanan, then of such a Goliath we know nothing, and it is a most unlikely coincidence of name with the conquered of David's sling.. Kennicott's seventy-eighth dissertation is occupied, and ably, with the pros and cons of this question; and the curiosities of Jerome on the passage may be found in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae.' There seems no sufficient reason to depart from our reading here, to which it were preferable to adjust the reading in the parallel place, which exhibits almost certainly a glaring corruption of text in another respect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A man of... stature. The Hebrew text is מִדָּה, as also in 1 Chronicles 11:28; and (in the plural) in Numbers 13:32. An eccentric and probably corrupt form appears in the parallel place. Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 2:43) speaks of the Sedigiti, and places them in the family of Forli, among the Himyarites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Jonathan (see 1 Samuel 13:3, 32; 1 Chronicles 27:32 (comp. also 1 Chronicles 2:13), where it is probable that\" nephew\" should be read for \"uncle\"). It is to be noticed that the name of this child of the giant, of twelve fingers and twelve toes, is not mentioned. We are not compelled, therefore, to regard it as remarkable that he of the fifth verse should not be named.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - These were born unto the giant in Gath. The parallel place reads, \"These four,,' etc. The first of the four in view there is not mentioned here. The account is given in 2 Samuel 21:15-17. And as it was in that encounter that David himself played the chief part (though, apparently, it was Abishai who dealt Ishbi-benob the fatal blow in \"succouring\" David), the notice of it would have seemed necessary to complete fully the sense of the following clauses, \"They fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.\" Still this, it may justly be argued, may have been the very reason of the form of expression here chosen, coupling David's work and that of his servants. This brief summary in the last verse of this chapter, as also in the last verse of the corresponding chapter, just serves to reveal to us the nexus that bound together the three or four exploits for narration. It consisted in the common descent of the four giant victims.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. This remarkable sentence takes the place of the statements in the parallel, \"And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.\" Our own passage seems to confine the temptation and sin to David. David also seems to be spoken of as the object of malignant attack on the part of Satan, though Israel is spoken of as the object of malignant envy and animosity. It is also to be noticed that in ver. 17 David takes all the blame to himself, and speaks of the people as \"innocent sheep.\" A people and whole nation have, indeed, often suffered the smart of one ruler's sin. Yet here the light thrown upon the whole event by the account in the Book of Samuel must be accepted as revealing the fact that there had been previously something amiss on the part of the people - perhaps something of illest significance lurking in their constitution. This alone could \"kindle the anger of the Lord against Israel.\" It is the opposite of this which kindles the anger of Satan - when he witnesses excellence, surpassing excellence, as when he witnesses \"the weakest saint,\" yet in that strongest position,\" on his knees.\" The apparent inconsistency in Satan being spoken of as resisting Israel, and the anger of the Lord being spoken of as kindled against Israel, is but apparent and superficial. In the first place, these histories do only purport to state the facts overt. And in this sense either alternative statement gives the prima facie facts. Either is true, and both may be true in different chronological order. And further, that the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel is no disproof that Satan will see and seize his opportunity. It looks the contrary way. There was a time and an occasion in Eden when Satan thought he saw an opportunity, tried it, and found it, when the anger of the Lord was not kindled against Adam and Eve for certain. But much more prompt will be the executive of Satan at another and less doubtful time. The paths in written history are often awhile rugged and broken up; the written history of Scripture is no exception. And in thus being the more in analogy with history itself, those unevennesses and breaks are the better attestation of both the reality of the Scripture history and the veracity of its writers. The word (שָׂטַן) occurs twenty-four times in the Old Testament. On all occasions of its occurrence in the Book of Job and in the prophecies of Zechariah, it shows the prefixed definite article; in all other places it is, with the present passage, unaccompanied by the article. Its translation here might appear strictly as that of a proper name. But this cannot be said of the other instances of its use, when without the article (Numbers 22:22, 32; 1 Samuel 29:4). This constitutes with some the ground of the very opposite opinion and opposite translation. If we regard the name as utterly expressing the personality of Satan, the passage is very noteworthy, and will be most safely regarded as the language of the compiler, and not as copied from the original source. The signification of the word \"Satan,\" as is well known, is \"adversary,\" or \"accuser.\" The sin of David in giving the order of this verse was of a technical and ceremonial character, in the first place, whatever his motives were, and however intensified by other causes of a moral and more individual complexion. We learn (Exodus 30:12-16) the special enactments respecting what was to be observed when \"the sum of the children of Israel after their number\" was to be taken. However, the same passage does not say, it fails to say, when such a numbering would be legitimate or when not. It is left us, therefore, to deduce this from observation. And we notice, in the first place, that, on the occasion of its undoubted rightness, it is the work of the distinct commandment of God (Numbers 1:1-3; Numbers 26:1-4). Next, we notice the religious contribution, \"the ransom,\" that was required with it (Exodus 30:12-16; Exodus 38:25, 26; Numbers 31:48-54). Again, we notice that the numberings narrated both in the beginning of the Book of Numbers (1.) and toward the close (26.) had specific moral objects as assigned by God - among them the forcible teaching of the loss entailed by the successive rebellions of the people (Numbers 26:64, 65; Deuteronomy 2:14, 15). And though last, not least, all these indications are lighted up by the express and emphatic announcements in God's original promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their seed should become past numbering, multitudinous as the stars, and as the sands of the seashore. From all which we may conclude that only that numbering was held legitimate which was for God's service in some form, and as against human pride and boastfulness - by God's command as against a human king's fancy - and which was attended by the payment of that solemn \"ransom\" money, the bekah, or half-shekel (Exodus 30:12). Other numbering had snares about it, and it was no doubt because it had such intrinsically that it was divinely discountenanced, and in this case severely punished. It seems gratuitous with some to tax David with having other motives than those of some sort of vanity now at work, sinister designs of preparing, unaided and unpermitted, some fresh military exploits, or stealing a march on the nation itself in the matter of some new system of taxation. The context offers no corroboration of either of these notions, while several lesser indications point to the simplest explanation (1 Chronicles 27:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And to the rulers of the people. So Numbers 1:4, \"And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers\" (see also 1 Chronicles 27:22-24; 2 Samuel 24:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? The place of this perfectly intelligible sentence, indicating that Joab discerned the object of David in desiring the numbering of the people, is occupied in the Book of Samuel by the words, \"And that the eyes of my lord the king may see it;\" which some for no very evident reason prefer. It was, no doubt, a very radical element of David's sin in this matter that he was thinking of the nation too much as his own servants, instead of as the servants of his one Master. The Lord ever knoweth who are his, and numbereth not only them and their names, but their every sigh, tear, prayer. A cause of trespass. This clause may be explained as though trespass was equivalent to the consequences, i.e. the punishment of trespass. This. however, rather tends to explain away than to explain a phrase. More probably the deeper meaning is that, in the fact of the numbering, nation and king would become one in act, and would become involved together in indisputable sin. Though there were no unfeigned assent and consent in the great body of the nation to the numbering, yet they would become participators in the wrong-doing. It would further seem evident, from Joab addressing these words to the king, that it was a thing familiarly known and thoroughly understood that the course David was now bent on following was one virtually, if not actually, prohibited, and not one merely likely to be displeasing to God on account of any individual disposition in David to be boastful or self-confident. Otherwise it would be scarcely within the province of Joab either to express or suppose this of his royal master.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. This short verse stands in the place of all the five verses of 2 Samuel 24:4-8, with their interesting contents, giving the route which Joab and his assistants took, and the time occupied (nine months and twenty days) to their return.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The report of the numbers as given in this verse does not tally with that of the parallel place. Here they are three hundred thousand more for Israel, and thirty thousand fewer for Judah, than there. No really satisfactory explanation of these discrepancies has yet appeared. The somewhat ingenious suggestion that the Chronicle-compiler counted in the standing army (two hundred and eighty-eight thousand, 1 Chronicles 27:1-15) for Israel, and omitted from Judah a supposed \"thirty thousand,\" under the head of \"the thirty\" of our ch. 11; while the writer of the Book of Samuel did exactly the converse, - can scarcely pass muster, although it must be noticed that it would meet in the main the exigencies of the case. A likelier suggestion might be found in a comparison of the statements of our ver. 6 compared with 1 Chronicles 27:22-24. Indeed, the last sentence of this last-quoted verse (1 Chronicles 27:24) may possibly contain the explanation of all (cutup. Numbers 1:47-50; Numbers 2:33). That Joab utterly refused to number Levi, because this was a thing most distinctly prohibited (and further because it was not material to David's presumable objects), was quite to be expected. And though Joab is said in the following verse not to have numbered Benjamin, it is possible enough that he may have known this number (1 Chronicles 7:6-11). Yet see what follows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Averse to his task as Joab was, he may have been indebted to the memory of the exemption of Levi from census for the idea of enlarging upon it and omitting Benjamin as well. The important contents of this short verse are not found in Samuel, so that we can borrow no light thence. But Benjamin was \"the least of the tribes\" (Judges 21:1-23), and Peele has suggested that God would not permit the numbers of either of these tribes to be lessened, as he foresaw that they would be faithful to the throne of David on the division of the kingdom. Others think that the omission of these tribes in the census may have been due to Joab's recall to Jerusalem before the completion of the work, and to the king's repentance in the interim cutting off the necessity of completing it. This little agrees, however, with the resolute tone and assigned reason contained in this verse. Peele's explanation, meantime, explains nothing in respect of the statement that the king's word was abominable to Joab.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Smote Israel. These two words serve simply to summarize in the first instance what the compiler is about to rehearse at greater length. The parallel place shows, \"And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.\" Some better power occasioned that smiting. Reflection brought to David's heart and conscience (1 Samuel 24:5), as often to those of others, restored vitality. The exact circumstances or providences, however, which roused into action the conscience of David are not stated. The second clause of our verse cannot refer to any preliminary smiting, but to the oncoming visitation of pestilence. It is noticeable, if only as a coincidence, that the eleventh verse of the parallel passage (2 Samuel 24:11) opens with a similarly ambiguously placed clause, \"For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet Gad,\" although this is explainable simply as our insufficient Authorized Version rendering. However, failing any external cause, the beginning of ver. 10 in this same parallel place may intimate the adequate account of all in the spontaneous stirring of David's conscience\" the bitter thoughts of conscience born.\" In these two verses we suddenly come upon the name \"God\" instead of \"the Lord,\" i.e. Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Gad, David's seer. The parallel place says, \"The Prophet Gad (הֲנָּבִיא), David's seer\" (2 Samuel 24:11). The Hebrew word here used in both passages for \"seer,\" is חֹזֶה, in place of the word of higher import, הָרֹאֶה, the use of which is confined to Samuel, Hanani, and to the person spoken of in Isaiah 30:10. In this last passage our Authorized Version translates \"prophet\" while in 1 Chronicles 29:29 our Authorized Version translates both Hebrew names in the very same verse by the one English word \"seer.\" Gad was, perhaps, a pupil of David (2 Samuel 22:8), and was the successor of Samuel (1 Chronicles 9:22) in this office.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose theeVERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEither three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Three years' famine. The parallel place has, in our Hebrew text, \"seven\" instead of \"three.\" But the Septuagint indicates this to be but a corruption of a later text; for it reads\" three,\" as here. The parallel place shows no mention of the destroying angel here spoken cf. The three inflictions of famine, sword, pestilence, are found not unfrequently elsewhere in Scripture (see Deuteronomy 28:21-25; Ezekiel 14:21; Revelation 6:4-8). Now ... advise thyself. The simple text is\" Now see,\" in place of \"Now know and see\" of the parallel passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - It is in such answers as these - answers of equal piety and practical wisdom, that the difference is often visible between the man radically bad, and the man good at heart and the child of grace, even when fallen into the deepest depth of sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - So the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel. This sentence is followed in the parallel place by \"from the morning even to the time appointed.\" It has been suggested that \"the time appointed\" may mean the time of the evening sacrifice, and that God shortened thus the three days to a short one day. There seems nothing sufficient to support the suggestion, unless it might lie in the \"repenting\" of the Lord, and his \"staying\" of the angel's hand, in ver. 15. There fell of Israel seventy thousand men. The whole number of Israel, including women, must have reached near to five millions. On this assumption, the sacrifice of life for Israel would be something like 14 per cent., or fourteen in the thousand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And God sent an angel. It is at this point first that any mention of an angel is found in the parallel place, but then not in the present form, but in a sentence which would seem to presuppose the knowledge of the agency of an angel on the occasion: \"And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil\" (2 Samuel 24:16). Stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan. The verb \"stood\" is employed here quite generically. It does not imply that the angel stood on the ground; for see next verse, in which it is said that he \"stood between the earth and the heaven,\" the Hebrew verb being exactly the same. Ornan is the uniform form and spelling of the name in Chronicles. In Samuel, however, the name appears as אֲרַנְוָה (2 Samuel 24:20), or Araunah. Yet in ver. 16, of the same chapter the Kethiv inverts the order of the resh and vau, prefixing the article, or what looks like it, and again in ver. 18 the Kethiv shows the form אֲרַנְיָה. Ornan, then, or Arauuah, was a descendant of the old Jebusite race to whom the fort of Zion once belonged. And the present narrative finds him living on the Hill of Moriah (Conder's' Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., 236 [6]). The threshing-floor. The primitive threshing-floors of the Israelites still essentially obtain. They were level spots of stamped and well-trodden earth, about fifty feet in diameter, and selected in positions most exposed to the wind, in order to take the advantage of its help in the separating of the grain from the chaff. On these circular spots of hard earth the sheaves of grain, of whatever kind, were distributed in all sorts of disorder. Oxen and other cattle trod them. And sometimes these beasts were driven round and round five abreast. The stalk of the grain was, of course, much bruised and crushed, and the method is described still as of a very rough and wasteful kind. Instruments were also employed, as the \"flail\" (Ruth 2:17; Isaiah 28:27, 28); the \"sledge,\" to which possibly reference is made in Judges 8:7, 16, under the name barkanim (Authorized Version, \"briers\"). These sledges were of two kinds:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the morag (2 Samuel 24:22; 1 Chronicles 21:23; Isaiah 41:15), made of fiat planks joined together, and furnished with rough studs on the under surface; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) agalah, rendered Authorized Version, \"cart-wheel\" (Isaiah 28:27), made of wooden rollers, or rollers of iron or stone, and dragged by cattle over the sheaves. Egypt and Syria, as well as Palestine, still show these instruments (see Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 1:550; and Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' pp. 538-541).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - These verses offer instances, especially the former, of the shorter narratives not being with Chronicles, but with Samuel And the longer narrative being with Chronicles is found uniformly in the cases in which reference is had, whether more or less directly, to the ecclesiastical or permanent institution of the Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The angel. The Hebrew shows no article (see Numbers 22:34, 35; 1 Kings 13:18; 1 Kings 19:5; Zechariah 1:9). The place where the altar was now about to be erected was that made famous by the sacrifice of Abraham (Genesis 22:2, 9), and, though less certainly, that known to the priesthood of Melchizedek (Genesis 14:17-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This verse is not found in the parallel place. The Septuagint reading of \"king\" in this verse, in place of \"angel,\" is no doubt an error. The drift of this and the following verse is plain and continuous. Ornan and his sons had hidden themselves on the apparition of the angel, but came out on the advent of David, to welcome him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The place of this threshing-floor; i.e. the place on which the threshing-floor was made. It was the level summit of the middle elevated ground of the eastern ridge on which Jerusalem was situate (1 Chronicles 11:4-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ornan's offer to David of the threshing-floor and all its belongings, as a gift, reminds of Ephron's offer to Abraham (Genesis 23:11). Ornan's prompt offer of gift was, perhaps, all the prompter from the desire to render every assistance to the staying of the plague. For burnt offerings ... for the meat offering. The whole code of regulations for offerings - sin offering, trespass offering, peace offering, burnt offering, meat and drink offering - is to be found in Leviticus 1-7. As regards the burnt offering, see Leviticus 1; Leviticus 6:8-13. It was called עֹלָה, from its \"ascending\" accepted to heaven, or else from its being put up or raised up (Hiph. conjugation) on the altar; and sometimes כָּלִיל, from being \"wholly\" consumed. The sin and trespass offerings were for special sins, but this was of a more comprehensive kind and of much greater dignity, as standing for the \"purging of the conscience.\" The entire consuming of the sacrifice signified the unqualified self-surrender of him who brought the sacrifice. It was a voluntary offering, the offerer laid his hand on the head of the victim, and the blood of the victim was sprinkled round about the altar. The meat offering (מִנְחָה) is fully described in Leviticus it.; Leviticus 6:14-23. It was an offering without blood, and therefore was an accompaniment of an offering of blood. It was composed of flour or cakes, prepared with salt, oil, and frank-incense - the salt emblematic of non-decay; the oil, of spiritual grace; and the frankincense, of acceptable fragrance. A portion of this offering was to be burnt, and a portion eaten by the priests in the court, unless it was for a priest himself, when all must be burnt. Meantime a drink offering of wine was, in fact, a part of the meat offering itself (Exodus 29:40, 41; Leviticus 23:13; Numbers 15:4-7, 9, 10). The material of the meat offering might be the green or fresh-gathered ears of corn. The Septuagint translates δῶρον; Luther, speis-opfer; and it need scarcely be said that our Authorized Version meat offering exhibits only the generic employment of the word \"meat\" for food.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Six hundred shekels of gold by weight. The only way to reconcile this statement with that of the parallel place, which (2 Samuel 24:24)speaks of \"fifty shekels of silver\" (i.e. taking the shekel at 2s. 8d., equal to about £6 13s. 4d.) as the price of \"the threshing-floor and the oxen,\" is to suppose that the fifty shekels speak of the purchase money of the oxen indeed, but not of the floor itself, which was valuable, not only for size and situation, but also for its prepared construction; or again, keeping to the literal language of Samuel, that \"the floor and the oxen\" are intended, while our expression, \"the place,\" may designate the whole hill. The value of gold as compared with silver was as sixteen to one. If this be the solution, we should have again an instance of the compiler of this book seizing for perpetuation the point of greatest and most permanent interest, i.e. the purchase of the whole place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He answered him from heaven by fire. There is no doubt significance in the fact that the compiler of Chronicles records this answer by fire, unmentioned in the Book of Samuel. He would give prominence to this great token, as determining, or going a great way towards determining, the site of the temple. The answer by fire was given on critical and special occasions (Leviticus 9:24; 1 Kings 18:24, 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing-floor. David \"saw \"this by the fire on the altar, and by the fact that God, at the voice of the angel (ver. 18), had not misdirected him, but had guided him aright. He sacrificed there. This means to say that he thenceforward \"sacrificed there;\" and established there the service of sacrifices. David was so impressed \"at that time,\" by the answer given in fire from heaven, that he began systematically to sacrifice on the site of this threshing-floor, instead of going to the high place at Gibeon, where the altar of burnt offering still stood. To have attempted to go thither would not only have meant a long and wasteful delay, but would also have meant the neglecting of the august omen of the angel present. An awful sanction is thus given to\" this place,\" Moriah, and it becomes\" the house of the Lord God,\" and the place of lawful and established sacrifice.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles21:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","1Chr.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This verse evidently belongs to the close of the last' chapter, and should have had its place there. It indicates a deep sense of relief that now visited David's mind. We can imagine how he had pondered often and long the \"place where\" of the \"exceeding magnificent\" house which it was in his heart to build for the Lord. The place was now found, and the more unexpected and \"dreadful\" (Genesis 28:17) the method by which it was arrived at, the more convincing and satisfactory, at all events in some points of view. The extraordinary and impressive designating of this spot was in itself a signal for an active commencement of the work, and made at the same time such commencement practicable. Solomon and many others would afterwards often think, often speak, of the \"threshing-finer of Ornan the Jebusite\" as the place \"which was shown to David his father,\" and which \"David had prepared\" (2 Chronicles 3:1). Here, then, he builds \"the altar of burnt offering,\" as, on the neighbouring \"hill of Zion,\" he had reared the \"tabernacle for the ark.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The strangers. These are plainly called in the Septuagint \"proselytes\" (τοὺς προσηλὺτους). They were, of course, foreign workmen, who came in pursuit of their trade. The injunctions as to \"strangers,\" and with regard to showing them kindness, are very numerous, beginning with Exodus 12:19, 48, 49; Exodus 22:21(20); Exodus 23:9; Leviticus 19:10, 33, 34; Numbers 15:14-16; Deuteronomy 10:18, 19; Joshua 8:33-35. It was not David's object merely to gain cheap or compulsory work (2 Chronicles 2:17, 18), but to obtain a skill, which immigrants from certain places would possess, in excess of that of his own people (2 Chronicles 2:7, 8, 13, 14), especially considering the absorption of Israel in the pursuit of war, which had so largely impeded their study and practice of these the arts of peace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Iron... the joinings; and brass. The very first Bible mention of metals (Genesis 4:22) places these two together. Whence Solomon got his \"abundance\" of the latter we have read in 1 Chronicles 18:8; for the \"abundance' of the former he would not necessarily go further than his own land. Although the expression, \"the land whose stones are iron\" (Deuteronomy 8:9), is possibly enough a poetical figure where it stands, yet some of the force of the figure may have sprung from its nearness to fact. The abundant use of iron in a great variety of tools, implements, weapons, and the knowledge of it in bar and sheet, might be illustrated from a large number of quotations from Scripture (Deuteronomy 19:5; Deuteronomy 27:5; 2 Samuel 12:31; 2 Kings 6:5; Isaiah 10:34; Amos 1:3; and many others). The \"joinings\" were the clamps and plates of various size and shape, which held strongly together, whether beams of wood or blocks of stone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Zidonians and they of Tyre (see 1 Kings 5:6, 9, 13-18; 2 Chronicles 2:16-18). The interesting passages in Homer, Herodotus, and Strabo, which speak of Zidon, etc., are in entire accord with what is here said, and are well worth perusal; e.g. 'Iliad,' 6:289-295, \"And she descended to the vaulted chamber, where were the garments all embroidered, the works of women of Sidon, whom the godlike Alexander himself brought from Sidon when he crossed the wide sea, by the way that he brought Helen of noble lineage;\" 'Iliad,' 23. 743, 744, \"And this vessel was of unsurpassed fame for beauty over all the land, for the men of Sidon, cunning artificers, had skilfully wrought it, and Phoenicians had brought it over the dark sea;\" 'Odyssey,' 4:615-618, \"And it was all silver, but the borders were mingled with gold. It was the work of Hephaestus. The illustrious Phademus, King of the Sidonians, gave it me when his palace sheltered me on my return thither;\" 'Odyssey,' 15:424, \"I boast to come from Sidon, famed for its skill in the working of brass.\" Similar references may be found in Herodotus (7:44, 96) and Strabo (16:2, § 23. See also 'Speaker's Commentary,' under 1 Kings 5:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Solomon... is young and tender. It is impossible to fix the exact age of Solomon as marked by these words. In a \"fragment\" of Eupolemus (see Cory's 'Ancient Fragments of the Phoenician,' etc., Writers,' edit. London, 1832) he is put down at twelve years of age. Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:7, § 8) as vaguely supposes he was fourteen at the time that he took the throne. He was the second son of Bathsheba, and can scarcely have exceeded the last-mentioned age by more than three or four years (yet comp. 1 Kings 2:2; 1 Kings 3:1, 7). This same language, \"young and tender,\" is repeated in 1 Chronicles 29:1. The reign of Solomon lasted forty years (1 Kings 11:42; 2 Chronicles 9:30). He is called old (1 Kings 11:4) when his strange wives \"turned away his heart after other gods.\" We are not told his age at the time of his death. There are, in fact, no sufficient data for fixing to the year, or indeed within the liberal margin of several years, the age now designated as young and tender.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - (Comp. 1 Chronicles 17:1, 2; 2 Samuel 7:2, 3.) For my son, the Chethiv shows \"his son,\" the Keri substituting \"my.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Because thou hast shed much blood. This is repeated very distinctly below (1 Chronicles 28:3), and appears there again as acknowledged by the lip of David himself. It seems remarkable that no previous statement of this objection, nor even allusion to it, is found. Further, there seems no very opportune place for it in either our 1 Chronicles 17:1-15 or in 2 Samuel 7:1-17. Yet, if it seem impossible to resist the impression that it must have found expression on the occasion referred to in those two passages, we may fit it in best between vers. 10 and 11 of the former reference, and between vers. 11 and 12 of the latter. So far, however, as our Hebrew text goes, this is the first place in which the statement is made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Shall be born. This is not the necessary translation of the verb. The form נולָד does not express here future time. Solomon was already born when the word of the Lord came to David. On the other hand, we may suppose special emphasis to belong to the clause, His name shall be Solomon. The name designates the man of peace, and the clause is an announcement, probably intended to throw further into the shade the alternative name Jedidiah, which also had been divinely given (2 Samuel 12:24, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The substance of this verse is found also in Nathan's language (1 Chronicles 17:12, 13; 2 Samuel 7:13, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The father's prayer for the son, and in his hearing, will have often recurred to the memory of Solomon, and may have been the germ of the son's own prayer, which \"pleased the Lord\" (1 Kings 3:5-14; 2 Chronicles 1:7-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The references to olden time, and the pointed reference to Moses, must be regarded as emphatic. In 1 Chronicles 28:20 we find the additional words, \"and do it,\" inserted after the animated and intensely earnest exhortation, Be strong, and of good courage. This inspiriting summons was no new one. It was probably already hallowed in the name of religious language, and would be often quoted (Deuteronomy 4:1; Deuteronomy 31:5-8; Joshua 1:5-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Now, behold, in my trouble. The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Luther's translation adopt here our marginal reading, \"poverty.\" Keil, Bertheau, and others translate, with much greater probability, \"by severe effort,\" which translation may be fortified, not only by such references as Genesis 31:43 and Psalm 132:1 (where the same root is found in Pual infinitive), but by the expression evidently answering to the present one in 1 Chronicles 29:2 (בּכָלאּכּוח), \"with all my strength.\" Moreover, David could not with correctness speak of poverty as characterizing his condition during the time that he had been collecting for the object of his heart's desire. And scarcely with any greater correctness could he speak of the necessary anxieties and responsibilities of his royal office as at all specially marking this period. A hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver. Our sense of dissatisfaction in being able neither heartily to accept nor conclusively to reject this statement of the quantities of gold and silver prepared by David, may be lessened in some degree by the statement found in ver. 16, that \"of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.\" Milman, in his 'History of the Jews' (1. 266, 267, edit. 1830), says upon the general subject of this verse, \"But enormous as this wealth (i.e. that of Solomon) appears, the statement of his expenditure on the temple, and of his annual revenue, so passes all credibility, that any attempt at forming a calculation, on the uncertain data we possess, may at once be abandoned as a hopeless task. No better proof can be given of the uncertainty of our authorities, of our imperfect knowledge of the Hebrew weights of money, and, above all, of our total ignorance of the relative value which the precious metals bore to the commodities of life, than the estimate made by Dr. Prideaux of the treasures left by David, amounting to eight hundred millions, nearly the capital of our national debt.\" It must be noted, however, that Milman himself proceeds, when speaking of \"the sources of the vast wealth which Solomon undoubtedly possessed,\" to bring very enormous sums (whether somewhat less or even somewhat more than the above estimate of Dr. Prideaux) more within the range of the possible, to our imagination. He justly remarks, for instance, that it is to be remembered that \"the treasures of David were accumulated rather by conquest than traffic, that some of the nations he subdued, particularly the Edomites, were very wealthy. All the tribes seem to have worn a great deal of gold and silver, both in their ornaments and in their armour; their idols were often of gold; and the treasuries of their temples, perhaps, contained considerable wealth. But during the reign of Solomon, almost the whole commerce of the world passed into his territories.\" After substantiating by details these and similar positions (pp. 267-271), he sums up, \"It was from these various sources of wealth that the precious metals and all other valuable commodities were in such abundance that, in the figurative language of the sacred historian, 'silver was in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees as sycamores.\" Since the date of Milman's words just quoted, however, investigation of ancient weights and measures, and of those of Scripture, has made some advance, yet not sufficient to enable us to arrive at any certainty as to those of our present passage. Assuming that the text of our present verse is not corrupt, and that the figures which it gives are correct, the weight and the value of the gold and silver mentioned are very great, whatever the talent in question. This assumption, however, cannot be relied upon, and it seems scarcely legitimate to interpret the talent as any than the Hebrew talent, considering the silence observed as regards any other. It need not be said here that the exchanges of money value were estimated in these times by so much weight of gold or silver. Further, \"the shekel of the sanctuary\" (Exodus 30:13; Leviticus 27:3), possibly the same with \"the shekel after the king's weight\" (2 Samuel 16:26), and which was kept in the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple - was presumably the standard. The gold talent was double the weight of the silver talent. It weighed 1,320,000 grains, instead of 660,000. The silver talent contained 50 manehs, of 60 shekels each; but the gold talent contained 100 manehs, of 100 shekels each. The modern money equivalents of these weights are very uncertain. Both the silver and the gold talent have been very variously calculated in this relation. Some of the best authorities put the silver talent at £342 3s. 9d., and the gold at £5475. This would make the money value described by this verse nearly nine hundred millions of our money. Other estimates are considerably in excess of this sum, and but few fall below it. Vast as the sum is, we may be helped in some degree to accept it by the statement of Pliny, who ('Nat. Hist.,' 32:15) tells us that Cyrus, in his subjugation of Asia, took half as many talents of silver as are here mentioned, and thirty-four thousand pounds of gold (see articles in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' on \"Money,\" and on\" Weights and Measures\"). Among the most valuable works on these subjects are De Saulcy's 'Numismatique Judaique,' and F. Madden's 'Jewish Coinage.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So too 1 Chronicles 28:21; 2 Chronicles 2:7, 17, 18; as well as vers. 2-4 of the present chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.

What David says here is equivalent to the declaration of the perfect fulfilment of the promises of nine hundred years ago. By faith of those very promises how many generations had lived! What journeyings, suspense, punishment, and struggle, the intervening centuries had witnessed! And now at last it is given to the lip of the aged David to pronounce the termination of a nation's prolonged conflict, its entrance into peace, and the fulfilment of the most impassioned wishes, ima-ginings, end prayers of the patriarchs, of Moses, and of a long line of the faithful. It was well for David that he could not foresee and did not know how near the culminating of a nation's glory and prosperity might be to its woeful fall and prolonged decay. The analogy that obtains in this respect between the history of an individual and of a nation is as remarkable as it should be instructive and turned to the uses of warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - To bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God. To settle these in a fixed home had now been of a long time the consuming desire of David's heart (so 1 Chronicles 15:1; 2 Chronicles 5:2-4). Into the house that is to be built. The preposition ל instead of אֶל, before \"the house,\" is to be noticed here (1 Chronicles 25:26; Nehemiah 10:35). Also the Niphal participle, הַגִּבְנֶהַ, here translated \"that is to be built,\" is to be noticed. The meaning of David would be better met probably thus: \"Arise, build the sanctuary... to bring the ark... into the house (then) builded to the Name of the Lord.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - David... made Solomon his son king over Israel. These words give the key note of what remains in this book. David made his son king, as he himself acknowledges (1 Chronicles 28:5), under the superintending direction of God. The manner in which the formal event was precipitated by the conduct of Adonijah is found at length in 1 Kings 1:11-53. The original occasion alluded to there more than once, on which David promised, \"and sware\" to Bathsheba, that her son should be his chief heir and successor to the throne, is not distinctly recorded. We can easily assign one convenient place in the history for it to have found monition, viz. in 2 Samuel 12:25. The brevity of the statement which composes this verse, when compared with all the deeply interesting matter recorded in 1 Kings 1:11-53, is one among many other very clear illustrations of the purposed silence of our present history in certain directions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. As on an occasion of supreme importance, David, in view of his own death and of his son's succession at the present time, calls together the full council, and the highest possible representative council of the nation. So 1 Chronicles 22:17; 1 Chronicles 24:6; 1 Chronicles 25:1; in which last passage the word \"captains\" should have have been rendered \"princes\" (שׂרִי). The arrangement of the Levites, and the distribution of their functions in the presence of the princes, as here described, and as it is even more strongly put (1 Chronicles 25:1), \"by\" them, simply points to the fact that the ultimate outer authority, as between Church and state, lay with the state. The Church was made for it, not it for the Church. And it was the duty of the state to defend the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward. The thing which Joab had rightly resisted (1 Chronicles 21:3-6) and shrunk from doing was now rightly done. There was now a practical and a legitimate object for doing it. This consideration helps to determine what it was that \"displeased the Lord\" in the former general census of David. In connection with this clause, 1 Chronicles 27:23 should be noted, where we read, \"But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.\" The period from the age of thirty years up to fifty (Numbers 4:3, 23, 35, 39) was fixed under Moses, for those \"that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation\" (Numbers 4:47). It is not certain, however, that this census did not inquire, in point of fact, respecting some below this limit of age. For we may note ver. 24 in the first place, and this is partly explained by Numbers 8:23-25. The number \"thirty and eight thousand\" of our present verse may be compared with the \"eight thousand and five hundred and four score\" of Numbers 4:47, 48. It is to be observed how promptly the national council did on this occasion commence with the arrangement of the ministers of religion, \"the Levites.\" As we read (Numbers 4:3) of \"thirty years\" of age as the appointed age for the commencement of their ministry, and (Numbers 7:3) of the present or \"offering\" of \"six covered waggons and twelve oxen,\" which the twelve \"princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, princes of the tribes,\" offered \"before the Lord,\" which greatly lessened the laborious work of the Levites; so we find the commencing age reduced from time to time, to \"twenty-five\" years (Numbers 8:24), and to \"twenty years\" of age, as in our present chapter (vers. 24-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - To set forward (Hebrew לְנַצֵּחַ, Piel conjugation). The strict meaning of the word here is to superintend. The word has already occurred in the same sense in 1 Chronicles 15:21. Officers and judges (Hebrew וְשֹׁמְרִים וְשֹׁפְטִים). The explanation of the nature of the work of these, as really outward work, for the \"outward business of Israel,\" is distinctly stated in 1 Chronicles 26:29; 2 Chronicles 19:5-11. These officers are mentioned under the same Hebrew term in Exodus 5:6, in a very different connection. It is plain that they were generally foremen, or overseers; while the judges took cognizance of matters which involved the interests of religion. This verse and the following give between them the four divisions of Levites, afterwards to be more fully described. The fuller account of the \"twenty-four thousand\" priests (including attendants) occupies ch. 24; the \"six thousand\" officers and judges, 1 Chronicles 26:20-32; the \"four thousand\" porters, 1 Chronicles 26:1-19; and the \"four thousand who praised the Lord with the instruments,\" ch. 25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Porters (Hebrew שֹׁעְרִים); doorkeepers. The word is so translated in 1 Chronicles 15:23, 24. It was the duty of these to keep the entrances of the sanctuary, by day and night, in their courses (see also 2 Kings 7:10, 11). The Chaldaic equivalent of this word is תָּרָע (Ezra 7:24; Daniel 2:49). There is no connection between either the word or idea we have here, and those of Psalm 84:11, where the Hithp. conjugation of סָפפ is used, and the sense of residence probably intended to be conveyed. The instruments which I made... to praise. Possibly the quotation of a short sentence often on David's lips. Men given to music may have been very conscious of it, in ancient days, as well as in modern. The language, however, does not necessarily assert that David claimed the inventing or in any similar sense the making of these musical instruments, but that he appointed them for the service of praise. What some of them were may be seen in 2 Chronicles 5:12 - \"cymbals, psalteries, harps, trumpets\" (see also 2 Chronicles 29:25-27; Nehemiah 12:35, 36; Amos 6:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Here begin the families of the Levites, as arranged in courses by David. These arrangements were scrupulously observed by Solomon (2 Chronicles 8:14; 2 Chronicles 29:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The heads of the houses of the first Levite family, viz., of Gershon, are now enumerated. The subject occupies the five verses that close with the eleventh. The family of Gershon branches into two - the name of the one Laadan (so written again in 1 Chronicles 26:21; but in 1 Chronicles 6:17, 20, as well as in Exodus 6:17 and Numbers 3:18, written Libui), and the name of the other Shimei.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - This verse contains the names of the three so-called sons of Laadan, but (1 Chronicles 26:22) the last two appear to have been grandsons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This verse purports to give the three sons of Shimei, but not the Shimei of ver. 7, but of a descendant of Laadan. This is made clear, not only by the remaining clause of this verse, which says, \"These were the chief of the fathers of Landau,\" and again by the enumeration in ver. 10 of sons of that Shimei who is coupled with Landau in ver. 7, but also by a comparison of 1 Chronicles 24:22; 1 Chronicles 26:21-26. It is, of course, possible that the name stands here in error for some other name, but the supposition is gratuitous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - (See Zechariah 12:13.) The Zina of this verse is Zizah in the very next verse, which difference of form cannot be accounted for by any mere clerical explanation. The name Jahath seems to have been a favourite name in this family (1 Chronicles 6:43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In one reckoning. The Hebrew of the word here translated \"reckoning\" is פְקֻדָּה, i.e. \"enumeration.\" The meaning is they were accounted as only one \"father's house.\" The derivative significations of the word are \"care,\" \"custody,\" and generally \"office\" (2 Chronicles 23:18). The total of Gershonite houses will amount to nine, three of these being houses of Shimei, and six of Landau.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This and the following eight verses give the Kohath heads of houses (1 Chronicles 5:28; 6:2, 3, 18 [1 Chronicles 6:2, 17, 18, 33]; Exodus 6:18; Numbers 3:27), four in their leading divisions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The sons of Amram. From Amram, the first-mentioned son of Kohath, come the two great names of Aaron and Moses (Exodus 6:20). Aaron was separated,... and his sons for ever. This statement must be read, both with ver. 3 - into the number of Levites mentioned in which Aaron and his sons do not count - and with ver. 14, which implies that Moses and his sons did count into that number. The sons of Aaron are dealt with in 1 Chronicles 24:1-19, infra. That he should sanctify the most holy things. The Hebrew text renders it doubtful whether the rendering here should not rather be, \"Aaron was separated to sanctify him as most holy,\" etc. If it be so, this is the only place where the forcible term, \"holy of holies\" (most holy), is used of Aaron. The duties of the priest are described as threefold, in this place, viz.: \"to burn incense before the Lord,\" - this will carry the idea of making atonement; \"to minister to God,\" on behalf of man, ? this will be one part of the work of a mediator; and \"to bless in the Name of God,\" - this will fulfil the remaining part. For ever. The proviso may, no doubt, include reference to the \"ever-living High Priest.\" The threefold summary of solemn and beneficent duties receives ample illustration from many passages, and in special connection with the names of Aaron and his sons (Exodus 28:1, 38, 43; Exodus 29:1, 35, 45; Exodus 30:7-10; Numbers 6:22-27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Moses the man of God. This title is distinguished by the presence of the article. The 'Speaker's Commentary' mentions it as occurring only nine times, of which five instances belong to Moses (Deuteronomy 33:1; Joshua 14:6; 2 Chronicles 30:16; Ezra 3:2; with the present place); three instances show the title applied to David (2 Chronicles 8:14; Nehemiah 12:24, 36); and once it is applied to Shemaiah (1 Kings 12:22). Although the sons of Moses belonged, as is here said, to the tribe of Levi, they did not belong to that portion which discharged priestly duties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - We read of the birth of Gershom to Moses and Zipporah (Exodus 2:22; see also Exodus 18:4, where Eliezer is also spoken of).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Shebuel (comp. 1 Chronicles 24:20, where the name appears as Shubael; and 1 Chron 26:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Rehabiah. He was the chief (הָראשׁ); but it happened that he was also the only son. Hence it is added in antithesis that his sons were very many (see the name again, 1 Chronicles 26:25). The non-priestly Amramites are therefore seen to correspond with the houses of Shebuel and Rehabiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Of the sons of Ishar. While six names in all are mentioned under Amram, only one, Shelomith, is found under his next brother, Izhar. This Shelomith (spelt Shelomoth in 1 Chronicles 24:22) is not the same with the Shelomith of 1 Chronicles 26:25, 26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Hebron.

The two houses from Uzziel given in this verse make up the number of houses from Kohath to nine (as given again in 1 Chronicles 24:20-24), and to these must be added the priests through Aaron and his sons, two houses, making in all eleven.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This and the following two verses give the houses of Merari, contributing four houses, and, with the nine Gershonite and eleven Kohathite, adding up to twenty-four. Merari is the third son of Levi (Genesis 46:11). The Mahli and Mushi of this verse were possibly grandson and son of Merari, if we follow the guidance of 1 Chronicles 6:47. Yet it would seem far more natural to explain this last-quoted passage by our ver. 23, which would then parallel it. Otherwise we must account for the name of Mahli habitually standing first, as here, as in 1 Chronicles 6:19 also, and 1 Chronicles 24:26, as also in Exodus 6:19; Numbers 3:20, 33, etc.; in all of which places the statement is as distinct as in this verse, that Mahli and Mushi were sons. This and the following verse must be compared particularly with 1 Chronicles 24:26-29; the Jaaziah of which passage was evidently no son of Merari, on a par with Mahli and Mushi, but a later descendant. His descendants were three - Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri (Beno being no proper name, but signifying \"his son\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Their brethren... took them; i.e. their kinsmen, as margin, \"took them\" to wife (Numbers 36:5-12). (For the sons of Kish, see 1 Chronicles 24:29.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The sons of Mushi (comp. 1 Chronicles 24:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - This and the remaining verses of the chapter contain some general provisions regarding the offices and future work of the Levites - in part David's last edition of such provisions. (On the present verse comp. Numbers 1:1-4; Numbers 4:1-3, 21-23, 29, 30; Numbers 8:23-26.) It is not easy to reconcile this verse with ver. 3. Keil cuts the knot at once by supposing the \"thirty\" years of ver. 3 to be the error of a copyist, to whose memory the Mosaic census was present. And with Bertheau, he objects to the supposition that this verse describes a supplementary census, in conformity with \"David's last words\" (ver. 27), and as contrasted with his former directions. With the exception of what is contained in vers. 25-27, it is true that these do not offer themselves sufficient indications to make one feel confident of this explanation. On the other hand, to set down the number \"thirty\" in ver. 3 at once to the mistake of a copyist is too summary and convenient a way of escaping an awkward difficulty. It is evident that the following three verses do purport to explain why at this time the age of allowable service was altered to a standard so much lower than of old, and to assert that this alteration was recognized by the last orders of David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For David said. The \"for\" of this clause cannot be supposed to account exclusively for the inclusion in the census of Levites beginning from the age of twenty years; it accounts no doubt for the whole proceeding. Since there would be no more journeyings for people, for buildings, or for sacred vessels, it was nosy fully time to organize religious duty and \"the service of the house of God\" in a manner adapted to permanent institutions. In order to this, the first step was to know and to arrange the number of those who were answerable for sacred duties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And also unto the Levites. Emphasis is laid on the thought of the relief that permanent habitation in Jerusalem conferred on the Levites over and above the whole body of the rest of the people.

The development and greater detail of their varied duties, as the working staff of the \"sons of Aaron,\" are alluded to here; and how priests, Levites, and Nethinim (1 Chronicles 9:2) all now formally undertook the whole range and scope of their functions is suggested. The work of these assistants of the \"sons of Aaron\" is detailed in three or four items, so far as this verse goes. They are first generally for the sacred service of the house of the Lord. That sacred service is in the matter of the courts (Exodus 27:9; 1 Kings 6:36; Conder's' Bible Handbook,' pp. 376-378, 2nd edit.); of the chambers (1 Chronicles 9:26; Ezekiel 40:17; Ezekiel 42:1; Nehemiah 10:38; Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' pp. 376, 380); of the purifying of all holy things: and of the work, i.e. the performing of the sacred service of the house of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Both for the shewbread, and... size. Seven other specifications of service are continued in this verse, with which we may compare 1 Chronicles 9:26-32. For the shewbread. The first mention of shewbread is found in Exodus 25:30. The directions for making it are found in Leviticus 24:5-9. The twelve unleavened cakes of which it consisted, heaped on the table in two piles, represented the twelve tribes, and intimated the Divine acceptance of the offerings of each faithful tribe (see also 2 Chronicles 13:11). For the fine flour for meat offering. This is spoken of in Exodus 29:40; Leviticus 2:1-7; Leviticus 6:14, 15, 19-27; Leviticus 23:13; Leviticus 14:5. For the unleavened cakes... the pan... fried. These are spoken of in Leviticus 2:4-7. For all manner of measure and size; Hebrew וּלְכָל־מְשׂוּרֶה וּמִדָּה. These two words occur also in Leviticus 19:35, 36, where they are rendered respectively \"in measure\" and \"in meteyard.\" Perhaps the exacter rendering here would be \"for all matters of liquid and solid measure.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - To stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord (so ver. 13 of this chapter and 1 Chronicles 25:7).

The word \"divisions\" is the same word that is translated \"courses\" in ver. 6, and which verse also would read literally, \"And David divided them divisions to the sons of Levi, to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\" Our present verse evidently continues both the subject and construction of that verse. Of the four sons (Exodus 6:23), two died without issue, viz. Nadab and Abihu (ver. 2); and the other two have to supply the \"chief men of the house,\" viz. Eleazar sixteen, and Ithamar eight (ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - (Comp.

And the evident purport of it is that the three, David, Zadok, and Ahimelech, conjointly made the arrangements. This is virtually repeated in vers. 6, 31 (see also 1 Chronicles 25:1 for an analogous case). For the \"Ahimelech\" of this verse and vers. 6, 31, should be read \"Abiathar,\" as shown in 1 Chronicles 18:16, by comparison of 1 Samuel 22:20; 2 Samuel 20:25; 1 Kings 1:7, 8; Mark 2:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided.

The governors; read rather, the princes. The distinction intended between \"the holy princes,\" or \"princes of the sanctuary,\" on the one hand, and \"the princes of God\" on the other, is not very clear. One instance of the former expression is found in Isaiah 43:28. Keil supposes there may be no distinction between them, but adds that if there is, he would take the \"princes of God\" to stand for the regular high priests exclusively, viz. those who could enter into the most holy place before God. The \"princes of God\" is a title evidently illustrated by the word \"Israel\" (Genesis 32:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The person who acted as clerk or secretary on the occasion, and the whole number of the witnesses, and the lot-taking itself, are here given. The present Hebrew text repeats the word אָחֻז (taken) twice, before the name of Ithamar, at the end of the sentence. The evident and easy correction of the first occurrence of which into אֶחָד (one) will make the clause and sense correspond with what goes before. Bertheau, however, and Keil, and some others do not accept this correction, and would keep the present Hebrew text, the first-named, moreover, contending that the repetition of the word for \"taking\" points to two lots being represented by each house of Ithamar, whose total number was only eight, for one of Eleazar, whose total was sixteen. Not only does the repetition of the present Hebrew text not avail to authorize such a supposition, but the supposition itself would be unsupported and gratuitous. What is really told us amounts to this only, that the drawing was first from the collection of families under the name of Eleazar, and then from that descended from Ithamar. For anything we are here told, the urn of Ithamar can have held out only half as long as that of Eleazar, and it can be only conjecture to suppose that two lots were drawn from the urn of Eleazar for every one from that of Ithamar, so as to make them run out together at the end. Could any one of the names from sixteen to twenty-four that are recorded in this chapter as \"coming forth\" in the shape of a \"lot,\" be identified as belonging to families descended from Ithamar, the question might be solved. Ahimelech the son of Abiathar; read, as above, ver. 3, 1 Chronicles 18:16, etc., Abiathar the son of Abimelech.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Jehoiarib.

An earlier priest of this same name is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 9:12, who is again mentioned in Nehemiah 11:12; Jeremiah 21:1; Jeremiah 38:1. The name in our present verse is probably the same (but used to mark a family and not the individual) as that found in Nehemiah 10:3 (see also Nehemiah 12:42). The Malchijah of Nehemiah 3:11 and Ezra 10:25 is the name of an Israelitish layman. Mijamin. In like manner, this as a family name reappears in Nehemiah 10:7; Nehemiah 12:5 (in the form Miamin), 17, 41 (in the form Miniamin); see also 2 Chronicles 31:15, where the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and the Peshito Syriac read Benjamin.

In Ezra 2:36 and Nehemiah 7:39 certain \"children of Jedaiah,\" who returned from Babylon, are mentioned as belonging to the \"house of Jeshua,\" and distinguished presumably thereby from children of another Jedaiah. This accords with the fact that in Nehemiah 12:6, 7, and again in 19, 21, two families of the name Jedaiah are given in the priest-lists. We may, therefore, conclude that families descended from the Jeshuah of our present verse were among those who returned from captivity (Ezra 2:36; Nehemiah 7:39). Shecaniah (see Nehemiah 12:3, where spelt Shechaniah). Of those similarly named in Ezra 8:3, 5, the former may possibly have been descendants of this Shecaniah, the latter not so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Eliashib.

Immer. The former name reappears, not for the same per-sen, in Nehemiah 12:5, 18; and, under a slightly altered form, Bilgai, in Nehemiah 10:8. The latter is the name of a family known already (1 Chronicles 9:12), and which became much better known (Ezra 2:37; Ezra 10:20; Nehemiah 3:29; Nehemiah 7:40; Nehemiah 11:13; Jeremiah 20:1). The notices parallel to one another (Ezra 2:59; Nehemiah 7:61) are interesting, but obscure.

Maaziah. The spelling of the former of these names, as it appears here and in Jeremiah 36:12, 25, differs by the addition of a shurek (וּ) from the name, spelt the same in the English Version, found in 1 Chronicles 3:24; Nehemiah 6:10; Nehemiah 7:62; Ezra 2:60. The latter name recurs in Nehemiah 10:8, etc., though without a final shurek.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The order has been thus given of the twenty-four classes or courses of the priests. Each course served a week from the seventh day to the seventh (2 Kings 11:9; 2 Chronicles 23:8). An interesting allusion to this order of courses is tacitly made in Ezekiel 8:16-18, where the twenty-fifth idolater may be supposed to be the high priest. Some have, on very insufficient grounds, supposed that this \"ordering\" of courses was not really the institution of David, but attributed to him after the Exile for the sake of the authority of his name. In Nehemiah 12:1-7, moreover, the names do not appear as even twenty-four, but twenty-two - deficient by two! - a thing most easily to be accounted for. In addition to the direct scriptural witness on this subject, Josephus's ('Ant.,' 7:14) testimony confirms the account of our present chapter, while Movers (in 'Chronik.,' 279) and Dehler (in Herzog's 'R.E.,' 12:185) effectively combat the positions of De Wette and Gramberg, and of Herzberg, in his 'History of the People of Israel.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-31. - The distribution of the other Levites. Verse 20. - The rest of the sons of Levi designated here are explained sufficiently clearly by ver. 30. They were those who were not of the sons of Aaron, not priests, but whose \"office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord\" (1 Chronicles 23:28), for certain specified work, some of which was of the more menial character. These, of course, do not exhaust the whole of the non-priestly Levites; for we read distinctly in the following two chapters of other detachments of the non-priestly Levites, whose office was as singers, doorkeepers, and treasure-keepers. And this consideration may of itself possibly be a sufficient account of the absence of any of the family of Gershonites in the list of the present chapter, though they do appear to view for other work in 1 Chronicles 26:21, etc. Amram... Shubael. The latter of these two names marks the line of Moses, in his eider son, Gershon, whose son was Shebuel (1 Chronicles 23:15, 16), as the former is the name of the father of Moses, and eldest son of Kohath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Rehabiah. This name marks the line of Moses, in the person of his younger son, Eliezer, father of Rehabiah. And the practical result of these two verses is to give us the two \"chiefs,\" or heads, or representatives, Jehdeiah and Isshiah, both Amramites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Jahath. Here follows in order after the Amramites, Jahath, a descendant from Izhar, Kohath's second son (1 Chronicles 23:12, 18), through Shelomoth (otherwise Shelemith). This Jahath furnishes for us the third name of this series of \"other sons of Levi.\" And Keil plausibly argues, from the absence of these three names from the list of 1 Chronicles 23:6, 23, that, while that list is occupied with fathers' houses, this list is occupied with the official classes of the Levites who were to be engaged in the way already stated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - This verse is manifestly imperfect. What is necessary to fill up the evident gaps is to be found, however, in 1 Chronicles 23:19; also the pointed allusion to the time of David, in 1 Chronicles 26:31, is deserving of especial notice. The four names of this verse, then, are descendants of Kohath's third son, Hebron (1 Chronicles 23:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - These verses give us Shamir and Zechariah, descendants of Uzziel, Kohath's fourth son (1 Chronicles 23:12), the former through Michah (1 Chronicles 23:20), and the latter through Michah's brother, Isshiah (1 Chronicles 23:20), called here \"sons of Uzziel,\" but presumably not intended for immediate sons (Exodus 6:22). In all these fourteen heads were drawn from the four sons of Kohath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-29. We now pass from the Kohath family to that of Merari. For the oft-repeated Mahli and Mushi, they belonged to the time of Moses (Exodus 6:19; Numbers 3:33). The elder of these, Mahli, as already seen in 1 Chronicles 23:21, 22, had two sons, Eleazar and Kish, the sons of the latter of whom took the daughters of Eleazar, who had no sons, and thus kept only one house surviving, the head of which was (ver. 29) Jerahmeel. This would seem to complete all that needs to be said of the Mahli line. Meantime, however, we are confronted by the contents of the latter half of our ver. 26 and ver. 27. These purport to give, amid some confusion of expression, sons of Merari by Jaaziah his son (Beno). No anterior authority, however, can be found for this Jaaziah. Neither of him nor of any of the three names (omitting Beno, which is evidently to be translated \"his son\") here linked on to his, is anything known. While we accept the text as it at present is, we have an additional branch with three families to add to the account of Merari - the branch of Jaaziah, the three families of Shoham, Zaeeur, Ibri. Even so we have in ver. 27 to obliterate arbitrarily the conjunction van, prefixed to the name Shoham. Under these circumstances, Keil impatiently rejects these clauses altogether, as an interpolation, though one of which he can give no account, and adds up, in consequence, the families of Levi (exclusive of the priests) to twenty-two instead of the unexplained twenty-five of the present text. On the other hand, Bertheau retains the present reading, and accepts Jaaziah as a third branch of the family of Merari. If this were so, it is surprising that nowhere else is room found for the slightest mention of Jaaziah, nor any other mention of these supposed descendants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth.

It is to be observed that, in the foregoing verses, we have no expressed sum of the families or heads to which they add up. Hence Bertheau finds twenty-five in all, which he would reduce to the twenty-four he wants by omitting, without any adequate justificacation, the Mahli of ver. 30. Others, omitting the three names of Shoham, Zaccur, Ibri, bring the twenty-five to twenty-two. Keil finds only fifteen \"heads\" or \"classes,\" but surmises that the Hebronite and Mushite \"fathers' houses\" may have been numerous enough to find more than one \"class;\" and thereby to make up the twenty-four classes which he desires as well for symmetry's sake as for the patent suggestions of ver. 31.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles24:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Over against... over against. This translation of the Hebrew (לְעמַּת) is obscure and awkward. The meaning is \"equally with,\" or \"correspondingly with\" (1 Chronicles 26:12, 16, etc.). The root means \"communion,\" and the word is found only in the constructive state.

The English should appear \"the sons of Asaph.\" Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun belonged respectively to the Gershon, Kohath, and Merarite families (1 Chronicles 6:18-32). Thus these singers and musicians were drawn from each great branch of Levi; viz. from Gershon, four through Asaph; from Kohath, six through Jeduthun; and from Merari, fourteen through Heman; while the whole number of those trained to sing was two hundred and eighty-eight. Who should prophesy. The Hebrew הַגִּבְּאִים (Jeremiah 14:14, 16) stands for Niphal participle plural, the singular of which (חַנּבָּא) appears in the following two verses. These were the utterers in song of the Divine mind and will. The essential meaning of the expression evidently is to use the voice in sacred service, more or less under Divine impulse. With cymbals. These instruments were used to regulate the time (compare this verse with 1 Chronicles 13:8). For some particulars respecting these and other musical instruments used in Israel at this time, the article \"Music\" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' may be consulted with advantage.

The name missing is Shimei, supplied by ver. 17, and which the Alexandrine Septuagint places fourth in this list. This is clear from the list of vers. 9-31, which contains all the same names as are found in the present vers. 2-4, and one more, Shimei, which therefore offers to supply the place vacant here. The name Zeri reappears in ver. 11 as Izri.

Spr.,' § 274, S. 672, 7th edit., cited by Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For the expression, the king's seer, and as other instances of the office, see 1 Chronicles 21:9; 2 Chronicles 35:15, in neither of which places, however, have we the attendant phrase, in the words of God. Yet we have the same sense strictly implied in 1 Chronicles 21:9, 19. The expression needs not to be generalized into \"in the matters of God,\" but evidently describes the seer (Heman, Gad, or Jeduthun) as the authorized medium of verbal communication between God and the king. There is difficulty in assigning the right place of the clause, to lift up the horn. There can be no doubt at all that it contains no allusion whatever to the horn as an instrument of sound (the almost solitary approach to which use of the word is found in Joshua 6:5), but that it falls in with the very frequent figurative use of the phrase as it occurs in the very same words (Psalm 75:5, 6; Psalm 89:18, 25; Psalm 92:12; Psalm 112:9; 1 Samuel 2:1, 10, etc.), and which means \"to add to the strength\" or \"honour\" of any one. The allusion is to the number of Heman's children being a mark of the honour God set on him. The words cannot go with the latter part of the verse, while the conjunction (vav) in וַיִּתֵּן opens it. The possible order may be, All these sons were to Heman, the king's seer, by the words of God, to lift up the horn. The absence of the third personal pronoun suffix to קֶרֶן is noticeable, place the clause where we will The statement of the fourteen sons and three daughters belonging to Heman, in this verse, shows that up to this point the word \"sons\" is used in its stricter sense, however true it may be that the sense is amplified in vers. 10-31.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This verse needs nothing except exact translation to make its meaning clear and consistent, All these (i.e. the names of vers. 2-4) were under the directions of their father, in the song of the house of the Lord, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, under the directions of the king, Asaph, and Jeduthun and Heman.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - This verse introduces a large additional number of those called for the present brethren of the foregoing twenty-four. These brethren (partly composed of their sons, as appears from vers. 9-31) were to aid in the songs of the Lord, and were apparently under instruction for that purpose. Each one of the twenty-four had eleven associated subordinates with him, and for whose instruction and service he was probably answerable. These would, of course, multiply up to the two hundred four score and eight mentioned in the verse. This verse appears (contrary to the interpretation of Keil, Bertheau, and others) with sufficient precision to mark two classes מְלֻמְּדֵי־שִׁיר, and הַמֵּבִּין, the latter not embracing the former, but the two together making up the two hundred and eighty-eight spoken cf. These two classes will surely satisfy the \"teacher and the scholar\" classification of the following verse; the classes are denoted by the same Hebrew roots. In ver. 7 the passive Pual participle of the instructed and the Hiphil participle of the cunning, or skilled, correspond exactly with the \"scholar\" (תַלְמִיד) and the \"teacher\" (מֵּבִין) of ver. 8. The contents of vers. 9-31 point to the same, being as they are without an allusion to any other outsiders - to any but the already introduced names of \"sons\" and \"brethren.\" The supposing, therefore, of any allusion here to the \"four thousand\" of 1 Chronicles 23:5 seems unnecessary and unnatural in whatever way they were distributed - and probably enough it was in an analogous manner - no distinct reference is made to them here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - This verse should be translated, And they cast lots of attendance, small and great equally, teacher with scholar. The Septuagint translates גורָלות מִשִׁמֶרֶת by the words κλήρους ἐφημεριῶν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-31. - List of the choirs in the order in which their lots came. The formula, his sons, and his brethren, which follows twenty-two out of the twenty-four leaders' names which now come before us, is absent from ver. 9, where we should have looked for it, viz. after the name Joseph. It has been supposed that this is a mere omission of carelessness. But this can scarcely be asserted conclusively. It is observable, for instance, that the order of the formula in the same verse, on occasion of its very first occurrence, is not identical with the other twenty-two instances of it, the word \"brethren\" preceding \"sons,\" and the pronoun \"he\" being expressed. The preposition (ל) is sometimes expressed and sometimes not expressed before both the proper names and the ordinal numerals of the list. Examination of the contents of these verses shows, either that it was due to the Divine direction of the lot (Proverbs 16:33) that an issue resulted which looks so unlike mere chance, and the system of which is so methodical and traceable; or that the lot-taking was not one of families and sons, all thrown together from the first. This supposition would, of course, leave room for some such ingenious hypothesis as that of Berthean, too artificial by far to be defensible except as a theory that would indeed work out the result. He suggests that the modus operandi was by two urns, one for the first seven odd numbers, into which were put the names of Asaph's four sons and of the second, third, and fourth of Heman; the other for the first seven even numbers, into which were put the six sons of Jeduthun and the first of Heman. Turning from such a concocted theory to these verses, we find that the first cast brings to the surface the second son of Asaph, and the second cast brings up the eldest son of Jeduthun. At the end of the seventh all of Asaph's sons are exhausted, and what would have been his next place (the ninth) is occupied by the second son of Heman, whose eldest had just taken the sixth place so thrown out by the lot. At the end of the fourteenth throw Jeduthun's six sons are all used up, and all the remaining places belong to Heman's sons, but still in the order in which they are thrown out by the lot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles25:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Mattithiah (see 1 Chronicles 15:18, 21).

The divisions of the porters spoken of in the present chapter were from the sons of Korah or Kore, and Merari (vers. 10, 19). The Korahite porters are given us in the first nine verses. The first mentioned is Meshelemiah, who, though called the same in vers. 2, 9, appears as Shelemiah in ver. 14, and in 1 Chronicles 9:19 as Shallum. Asaph, given here as one of the ancestors, must be replaced by Ebi-asaph (1 Chronicles 6:23, 37; 1 Chronicles 9:19; also Exodus 6:24), who was a Korahite, whereas Asaph was a Gershonite (1 Chronicles 6:39, 43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - These verses contain the enumeration of seven sons of Shelemiah, of the firstborn of whom, viz.

That in this last reference Obed-edom seems to be called \"son of Jeduthun\" is owing probably to the omission of a name. For former occurrences of the sentence, God blessed him, with its present evident allusion, see 1 Chronicles 13:14; 2 Samuel 6:11. To this passage, the expression of 1 Chronicles 25:5, \"to lift up the horn,\" is probably analogous, where see comment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmmiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - In the former of these verses, eulogy is pronounced by anticipation on the six grandsons of Obed-edom through his son Shemaiah, about to be mentioned in the latter verse. The singular number of the verb (נולַד), with a plural nominative, as found here, often occurs elsewhere, and repeatedly, even in this book, in cases where the relative pronoun אַשֶׁר intervenes between the subject and its verb. That ruled throughout the house of their father. The plural masculine abstract noun (הַמִּמְשָׁלִים) here employed, in place of a verbal or participial form, is intended to gain force. A similar use of the feminine form of the same noun in the singular, and with suffix, may be cited from 2 Chronicles 32:9. Whose brethren. An erroneous translation for his brethren; a correction, however, rendering more patent the inconvenience of the unexplained absence of the conjunction, which seems to be called for before both \"Elzabad,\" and \"his brethren.\" Bertheau suggests that other names are wanting which should fill up the meaning of \"his brethren.\" The brethren intended were probably Elihu and Semachiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obededom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Able men for strength for the service.

Hosah, it will be remembered, is found together with Obed-edom in 1 Chronicles 16:38, as one of the porters of the the ark. These thirteen bring up the number of porters to ninety-three. We have read (1 Chronicles 9:22) that later the number became two hundred and twelve. Though... yet. The likelier translation of the Hebrew would be, For there was not a firstborn (i.e. the issue of the firstborn had failed, and his line was therefore extinct), and his father made him the chief. Moreover, it is but probable that, if it had been a case of superseding the firstborn, the fact would not have been stated without an explanation of what had led to it or justified it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmong these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Translate, To these divisions of the porters, as regards the chief men, belonged the charge together with their brethren to officiate in the house of the Lord. According to the present chapter, then, the divisions add up to ninety-three. And if at any time of the history it were the case that these ninety-three were the leaders of groups among the total of \"four thousand porters,\" it would put exactly forty-two under each of these ninety-three, leaving but one over. This number ninety-three, meantime, does not agree with the two hundred and twelve of 1 Chronicles 9:22. And the three score and two of Obed-edom in ver. 8 of the present chapter does not agree with the three score and eight of Obed-edom in 1 Chronicles 16:38. At the same time, no little light may be thrown on this subject by noticing that the porters numbered in Zerubbabel's time one hundred and thirty-nine (Ezra 2:42); and that the number one hundred and seventy-two is given for them by Nehemiah (Nehemiah 11:19). The conclusion may well be that the numbers varied in David's time and the other times severally;and that the date in question (1 Chronicles 9:22) was not the same with the date of David in our present chapter, but was a subsequent date nearer the time of the Captivity. There is, therefore, no special ground for doubting the accuracy of the numbers given in this chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counseller, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-16. - The casting of lots for the four chief names and the four chief aspects of gates, now proceeds. A special note is made of the care taken for the house of Asuppim; i.e. of \"gatherings\" or \"stores.\" For all that we know of this \"house,\" we seem to be left to the verses (15, 17) of this passage, and to the expression (Nehemiah 12:25), \"the storehouses, or stores of the gates\" (though the Authorized Version, the \"thresholds\" of the gates), which would have been more intelligible had it been reversed, \"the gates of the stores.\" Presumably it was a building for keeping safe certain of the sacred property, and was situated south of the temple, and, judging from ver. 17, had two doorways. The Vulgate translates seniorum concilium. To Shuppim. Nothing can be made of this word in this connection, as a proper name, though we have it (1 Chronicles 7:12, 15) as such. It is now generally rejected, as probably due to the error of some transcriber, whose eye may have been caught again by the last two syllables of the closely preceding \"Asuppim.\" But some would place it as the last word of the previous verse, and make it amplify the meaning of Asuppim, e.g. \"gatherings for stores.\" Shallecheth. By derivation, this word means \"sending or throwing down.\" Hence some call it, \"the refuse gate.\" The situation of it is, however, defined here, as by the causeway of the going up, and would seem to render such an interpretation less likely. According to Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), this causeway is still traceable: it runs up from the central valley of the town to the sacred site west of the temple (1 Kings 10:5; 2 Chronicles 9:4); and Grove would identify the \"gate of Shallecheth\" with the present Bab Silsileh. The Septuagint translates ἡ πυλὴ παστοφορίου, i.e. the gate of the temple-cell, which word they could get from the inverting of the order of the first two letters of the Hebrew Shallecheth. The Septuagint then mutts the following word, מְסִלָּה, Ward against ward; i.e. watch with watch. The expression up- pears to refer to the fact that Hosah's lot threw to him the charge of a double position.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - These verses give the number of individuals who composed the watch at a time, beginning again from Shelemiah's eastward position. The two and two toward Asuppim suggest most naturally the suppositon of two attendants at each of two gates, or else of two succeeding two. Parbar (פַרְבָּר). This word appears as פָּרְוָר in 2 Kings 23:11. These words, with forms akin to them, are often found in the Targums, but not elsewhere in the Scriptures. The nearest approach to the meaning of the word, as yet discovered, is a \"suburb.\" The connection may just do as much as indicate that, whereas four porters kept the causeway gate, the Parbar gate was in closer proximity to the temple that was to be, but what this Parbar really was is not yet ascertained. Possibly it is the προάστειον of Josephus ('Ant.,' 15. 11:5).

Those who think that 1 Chronicles 23:8 carries with it the meaning that Jehieli, Zetham, and Joel were all three brothers, can, in point of fact, plausibly reduce this verse to their shape.

One might, under these circumstances, have looked for the name of some member of each of these sub-families to appear in the number of the treasure-keepers just about to be mentioned. This is not so. Yet among other officials, and before the end of the general subject, the Izharites (ver. 29) and the Hebronites (vers. 30, 31) do appear. This may possibly explain the mapping out thus of the Kohath family.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - Shebuel (1 Chronicles 23:16; 1 Chronicles 24:20), then, was the Amramite representative (and apparently a very special one in the office of נָגִיר, here attributed to him) through Gershom, the elder son of Moses. Next, through Eliezer, the second son of Moses, and through Rehabiah, son of Eliezer (1 Chronicles 23:17), we are brought to the four - Jeshaiah (1 Chronicles 24:21, Isshiah), and Joram, and Zichri, and Shelomith, who seem at first to mark four successions of generations upon Rehabiah, but who more probably (though it cannot be said positively) were four brothers, each a son of Rehabiah (1 Chronicles 23:17). And it may be that it is to these four that reference is made in the first clause of our next verse (26), \"Which Shelomith and his brethren,\" etc. The Shelomith here intended as an Amramite must be distinguished from the Gershonite of 1 Chronicles 23:9, and from the Izharite of 1 Chronicles 23:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The treasures. The very first use of this word to signify a place where treasures were kept is in Joshua 6:19, 24. The same word is used for either the place or the treasures kept in it. Not found in the Books of Samuel, the word often occurs in the two Books of Kings and of Chronicles, once in Ezra, several times in Nehemiah, etc. In our next chapter (1 Chronicles 27:25, 27, 28) it appears in the Authorized Version as \"storehouses\" and \"cellars.\" Captains over thousands and hundreds (so see Exodus 18:21, 25; Numbers 31:14, etc.; Deuteronomy 1:15; 1 Samuel 8:12, etc.). Captains of the host (so Deuteronomy 20:9; Joshua 5:14, 15; Judges 4:2; 1 Samuel 17:55, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - For such proceeds of war, see 2 Samuel 8:10-12, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - It is, perhaps, somewhat remarkable that, though the sacred history suggests to us numerous fit occasions for the \"dedications\" spoken of in this verse, yet they are not described in detail, nor even alluded to at the times when they occurred. Samuel, Saul, Abner, and Joab had then been unwittingly finding some of the treasures now disposed to highest use by David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-32. - The chapter closes with some enumeration of those who were appointed to the outward business (הַחִיעונָה לַמְּלָאכָה) over Israel i.e. the secular or civic rather than temple business. Verse 29. - Though the Authorized Version of 1 Chronicles 15:22 would make it appear very unlikely that the Chenaniah, a \"chief of the Levites,\" here spoken of was identical with the present Chenaniah, yet the other translation of that passage, and the view that some take of it as describing one who had the special ordering of the carrying of the ark, would leave it more likely. For the officers and judges, see 1 Chronicles 23:4; 2 Chronicles 19:5-11. The too generic term \"officers\" (Exodus 5:6-19: Numbers 11:16, etc.) may be advantageously superseded by the word \"scribes.\" These scribes and judges, it appears, were taken from the families of Izhar and Hebron alone, without any Amramite or Uzzielite of the other Kohathites, and without any Gershonite or Merarite of the other Levites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Were officers among them of Israel. The simpler translation would be, were for the superintending of Israel (compare the verb in ver. 32). On this side Jordan westward; literally, across Jordan westward, the point of view being from the Persian side. So Ezra 4:16; Ezra 6:6; Ezra 8:36; Nehemiah 2:7; but also Joshua 5:1; Joshua 22:7, when the point of view was that of those who had still to cross the Jordan to the west. The expression, in all the business of the Lord, is probably no mere reminiscence of the temple or semi-sacred business (such as the gathering of the tithes, etc.), but rather the recognition of the fact that all that pertained to the right discharge of the civil duties of an Israelite's life lay within that description.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmong the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - This verse is at first sight obscure; but its purport is to say that the Hebronite family was, in the lust year of David's reign, found at Jazer of Gilead, which seems a Merarite city (Joshua 13:25; Joshua 21:39; Numbers 21:32), and that Jerijah (1 Chronicles 23:19; 1 Chronicles 24:23) was then chief of them. He and his brethren were now appointed to the superintendence of the two tribes and a half eastward of Jordan, while \"Hashabiah and his brethren\" fulfilled the like duties westward of Jordan The number of those east of Jordan constituted overseers seems large in proportion to those mentioned on the west; but we must bear in mind that the numbers of Chenaniah and their range of sphere are not stated. These will presumably complete the six thousand of 1 Chronicles 23:4. Otherwise we have but to fall back on the conviction that the present account is imperfect as well as brief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles26:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Chief fathers. The number of chief fathers mentioned in this verse leads Keil to point out very justly that here at least the designation cannot mean anything beyond the fathers of individual families - cannot mean the heads of those groups which are composed of all the branches or relations of one house. They must have been heads of households (πατέρες), not heads of fathers houses (πατριαί). The ambiguity is owing to the use of the words רָשֵׁי הָאָבות in ver. 32, the latter of which words has so often supposed the word בֵּית to precede it, coupled to it by a hyphen. Adding the numbers of vers. 30 and 32, we find a total of Hebronite \"officers and judges\" amounting to four thousand four hundred. The remaining sixteen hundred to complete the\" six thousand\" were drawn from the Gershon, Amram, and Izhar families. Some of the Uzzielites probably helped the Hebronites.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - It is impossible to feel fully satisfied with any translation which the words of this verse offer. Yet there can scarcely he any doubt of the meaning of the verse, viz. that the writer would speak of the children of Israel, including the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, as regards their courses and their number in their courses, as they succeeded one another, month by month, including also all those officers who served the king in any relation to these courses - the courses were twelve, and each course was numbered twenty-four thousand. Meantime, when we turn to the list, we do not find any full complement of chiefs, captains, and officers specified, but apparently only the chief of each course, with somewhat ambiguous additions in vers. 4 (Mikloth), 6 (Ammizabad), 7 (Zebadiah); while what seems an unnecessary stress repeats the number each time. This, however, in fact, tallies with the clause \"respecting their number\" in the first verse, and may constitute the explanation of the apparent inconsistency in question. Milman ('Hist. of the Jews,' 1:251, edit. 1830) says on this military portion of David's preparations, that he \"organized an immense disposable force; every month twenty-four thousand men, furnished in rotation by the tribes, appeared in arms, and were trained as the standing militia of the country. At the head of his army were officers of consummate experience and, what was more highly esteemed in the warfare of the time, extraordinary personal activity, strength, and valour. His heroes remind us of those of Arthuror Charlemagne, excepting that the armour of the feudal chieftains constituted their superiority; here, main strength of body and dauntless fortitude of mind.\" Which came in and went out month by month; i.e. exchanged places in rotation (2 Kings 11:5-7, 9; 2 Chronicles 23:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOver the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Jashobeam is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 12:11 as son of Hachmoni, and as one of those \"three mighties\" of David, of whom the other two were Eleazar and Shammah (see also 1 Chronicles 12:6); he is again referred to (2 Samuel 23:8) in a verse of which the text is corrupt, as \"the Tachmonite,\" or more correctly \"the Tahh-cemonite.\" The tau in this word is probably an error for the article. Kennicott ('Dies.,' 72, 82) confirms this supposition by noting that the Book of Samuel constantly replaces by the definite article what appears in Chronicles as \"son of.\" He has also shown reason for believing that the words in this passage, \"that sat in the seat, are a corruption of the Hebrew text for characters that would spell our name \"Jashobeam.\" We know nothing of this name \"Hachmon,\" which may be the name of an earlier forefather, while Zabdiel, thence named \"the Hach-monite,\" appears to Be the name of the actual father of Jashobeam. Jashobeam was of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This verse tells us that Jasho-beam belonged to the tribe of Judah, through Perez, the fourth son of Judah (1 Chronicles 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Before the name Dodai we must supply \"Eleazar the son of,\" on the authority of 1 Chronicles 11:12; 2 Samuel 23:9. The allusion to Mikloth (of the tribe of Benjamin, according to 1 Chronicles 8:32; 1 Chronicles 9:37) in this verse is not plain. The translation may possibly be the same which our Authorized Version gives, And over the course of the second month was (Eleazar, the son of) Dodai the Ahohite, and (over) his (or, its) course also Mikloth was ruler. The appearances of the Hebrew text, however, favour the supposition of an inaccurate text. A somewhat similar con. struction and position of words in ver. 6 is less difficult by the absence of a conjunction before Ammizabad.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Benaiah (1 Chronicles 11:22-25; 2 Samuel 23:20-23). To this name Keil thinks the word chief (רלֺאשׁ), in the succeeding expression, chief priest, belongs. Thus Jehoiada would be named here only priest. Yet see 1 Chronicles 12:27, where Jehoiada is called לְאַהֲרֹן חַגָּגִיד; and 2 Kings 25:18; where כֹּהֵן הָרלֺאשׁ stands for our הכֹּהֵן רלֺאשׁ, as applied to Seraiah. Benaiah was manifestly a Aaronite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - With this verse, as Keil observes, the description of the successive courses is given with the greatest brevity. Zebadiah was of Judah. Inasmuch as Asahel (1 Chronicles 11:26; 2 Samuel 23:24) was killed by Abner (2 Samuel 2:23) before this division of military courses was made, it is evident that his name in this place marks, not the individual, but the family. Possibly he and his name were held in all the greater regard, and his son Zebadiah best known for the sake of his father.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Shamhuth. For variations in the form of this name, see ch. 11:27; 2 Samuel 23:25. In the former of these passages also we have Harorite in place of our Izrahite, and in the latter Harodite. The Izrahite probably means of the family of Zerah (1 Chronicles 2:4, 6), and of course marks one of the tribe of Judah. The Hebrew הַיִּזְרָחevidently does not justify the form as translated \"Izrahite.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For Ira, see 1 Chronicles 11:28; 2 Samuel 23:26.

He was a Zarhite, and belonged to the tribe of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For Abiezer, of the tribe of Benjamin, see 1 Chronicles 11:28; 2 Samuel 23:27.

The Netophathite. Though the name of the town Netophah happens to occur only after the Captivity (e.g. Ezra 2:22; Nehemiah 7:26), yet the name of the people, as in this passage, was evidently a name existing before the Captivity (see also ch. 2:54; 9:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For this Benaiah, who was of Ephraim, see 1 Chronicles 11:31; 2 Samuel 23:30. For Pirathon, see Judges 12:15, where alone the place is mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For Heldai, who belonged to Judah, see 1 Chronicles 11:30, where the name appears as Heled, and 2 Samuel 23:29, where it appears as Heleb. For Othniel (who was nephew and son-in-law of Caleb, and first deliverer of the people after Joshua), see Joshua 15:17; Judges 3:9. These twelve captains then come - from Judah seven, from Benjamin and Ephraim two each, and from Levi one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFurthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-22. - These verses give the names of the rulers (ver. 16), or princes (ver. 22), of ten out of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribes not mentioned are Gad and Asher, an omission which reminds of that of the two tribes Dan and Zebulon from the genealogies contained in ch. 4-7, and equally unexplained. These designations ruler (נָגִיד) and prince (שַׂר) are the same as are found in the list of vers. 1-15 - the former in ver. 4, and translated also as here \"ruler;\" and the latter in vers. 1, 3, 5, 8, under the Authorized Version word of\" captains.\" This rehearsal of the rulers or captains of the tribes stands evidently in no special relation to the preceding military enumeration, but it forms naturally enough one of four lists in this chapter that purport to set forth David's complete arrangement of the affairs of the kingdom. So far as the enumeration goes, it appears to aim at fulness and no omission, for the \"Aaronites\" (ver. 17) are given, and Ephraim and the two halves of Manasseh separately (vers. 20, 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites, Zadok:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - It is, perhaps, remarkable that Hashabiah - presumably a Gershonite - is not distinguished from the Hebronite (i.e. Kohathite) of the same name (1 Chronicles 26:30); some, however, think that our Hasha-biah is the Kohathite (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:759 b). For Zadok, see ch. 6:4, 12.

For Michael, see ch. 7:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - There is no reason to doubt that Jaasiel is the son of the Abner who was Saul's own cousin (1 Chronicles 9:36; 1 Samuel 14:50).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - These thirteen princes of the tribes of Israel were presumably in each case those who represented the tribe according to lineal descent in David's time. Though Gad and Asher are left out, the thirteen are filled up by the allowance of two for Levi, viz. one for the Levites and one for the priests; and three for Joseph, viz. one for Ephraim and two for the divided tribe of Manasseh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The contents of this and the following verse may be supposed to be suggested by the distinct reference to the matter of number in the first verse of the chapter, and in the latter halves of the following fourteen verses, contrasting with the utter absence of any allusion to the same matter, when the whole body of the tribes and their princes are the subject, in vers. 16-22. The deeper significance of the latter part of this verse probably comes to this; that God had already given his people the proudest name for their numbers, in saying that they should be numberless, like to the stars of the heavens, and perpetually on the increase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJoab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - It seems a little surprising to read of Joab, fixed on the page of history as the person who began to number, but... finished not, when we have been already particularly told that it was he to whom King David's command to number was \"abominable\" (1 Chronicles 21:6). However differently enough from the method of either nature or mankind, the antidote has here preceded the evil. For because there fell wrath for it, read the Hebrew, and there was for this wrath upon Israel. The last sentence of the verse purports to say that such numbering as had been done before the point at which Joab stopped was not honoured by a place, where other numbers were found, in the register of the chronicles of King David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-31. - These verses have for their primary object, not to give an exhaustive summary of the wealth of David and the sources thereof, but to give the names of those persons who were charged with the care, or the management and care, of' it. The classification, however, is interesting, and may be naturally expected to be tolerably complete. We do not find any distinction made between such property as might have belonged to David as private property, and such as belonged to him as king - probably because there was none worth making. Verse 25. - For storehouses, read, as in former clause, treasures. The suggestion of the second half of this verse in comparison with the first is that Azmaveth's charge was over treasures in Jerusalem. For the castles, see 2 Chronicles 17:12; 2 Chronicles 27:4. The word אוצָר, though the same in both clauses, may probably enough cover precious treasure, as of gold, silver, costly raiment, etc. (1 Kings 14:26; 1 Kings 15:18), more particularly in the first clause, and grain, fruit, etc. (2 Chronicles 11:11), in the latter, for the word has distinctly this double application. (See for some illustration of this verse also, Sallust., 'De Belle Jugurth.,' 12.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - This verse appears to give the name, not (as in the former verse) of the person who had charge of the stored grain, fruits, etc, but of the chief superintendent and manager of the labour and labourers of the field.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - This verse specifies the officer who had the management of the vineyards, and also the officer who had charge over the wine-cellars. The description of Ramathite does not assist us to identify Shimei, though the choice of place is ample (Joshua 13:26; Joshua 18:25; Joshua 19:29, 36; Judges 15:17). For Shiphmite, see Numbers 34:10, 11; to the place Shepham, mentioned in which passage, the reference here may be. For over the increase, read over that which in the vineyards, etc., where the initial שׁ stands for אֲשֶׁר.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - A similar couple of officers to those of the last verse are described here. By the low plains here in the Authorized Version is translated what had been better left untranslated, i.e. the Shephelah, one of the five divisions of Judaea (Conder's' Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., 1880, p. 257). It comprised the low-lying tract of land on the coast and, roughly speaking, stretching from Joppa to Gaza. The sycamore tree (הַשִּׁקְמִום, a plural masculine, and once שִׁקְמות, a plural feminine, Psalm 78:87) is to be distinguished from the sycamine, being that kind of mulberry tree called fig mulberry. The Septuagint, however, does not observe the distinction, and always translates συκάμινος. It was a common tree, and useful to the poor. It is the same with the black mulberry of Egypt, and abounded in Palestine (1 Kings 10:27). Its fruit was eatable, and its wood, though soft, yet valuable for enduringness (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3. p. 1394; Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., pp. 223, 399; Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 146, 393). The name Baal-hanan comes first before us as that of a King of Edom (Genesis 36:38, 39; 1 Chronicles 1:49). The place Gederah (Joshua 15:36), or Beth-gader (1 Chronicles 2:51), attached to the name of the present Baal-hanan, renders it not less probable that he was of similar extraction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Sharon (see 1 Chronicles 5:16, 21). It means with the article, which, with one exception, always accompanies it, \"the level laud,\" and on the west of the Jordan exactly corresponds with the Mishor on the east, a word of identical signification with Sharon. The tract of pasture-land which it designated stretched from Carmel to Joppa (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 485, 260, 264). The valleys here intended are not specified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOver the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Whether the word Obil (אובִיל), is a proper name or not, it signifies \"a tender of camels\" by derivation. The task suited the Ishmaelite, no doubt! Nothing is known of the Meronothite, nor of the situation of the place called Meronoth, unless anything may be conjectured from Nehemiah 3:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite.

For the rulers of the substance, the Hebrew words are שָׂרֵי הָרְכּוּשׁ. The number of them adds up again to twelve; Keil justly supposes that the two named in ver. 25 were those principal officers to whom the other ten delivered the proceeds of their respective charges.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso Jonathan David's uncle was a counseller, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32-34. - These verses contain the names of seven men of high position, and who were, at all events, important enough, in one respect or another, for this closing special mention.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Jonathan and Ahithophel are singled out as counsellors (יועֵצ) of the king.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Hushai the Archite is mentioned as the companion (רֵעַ) of the king.NEWLINENEWLINE3. Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar are mentioned as standing in a similar relation of counsellors to the king with Ahithophel, but after him.NEWLINENEWLINE4. The great general of the whole army of the king (שַׂר־צָבָא), Joab, has a place found for his name.NEWLINENEWLINE5. And the name of Jehiel is mentioned as of one with the king's sons. The first thing which may be observed as to this enumeration is that it is not one whole belonging to the later portion of David's time. Ahithophel had brag before put an end to his own life (2 Samuel 17:21-23; also see 2 Samuel 15:12, 31, 34; 16:20-23). Secondly, that out of the seven names, four or five are already well known to us in some other capacity; for see the lists of 1 Chronicles 18:14-17; 2 Samuel 8:16-18; 2 Samuel 20:23-26. And thirdly, that in one or two instances, a different or additional part is assigned to the names mentioned. The impression left with us is rather of honourable or special mention made of seven who had been distinguished helpers of the king or the kingdom at one time or another. Verse 32. - Nothing is known of any uncle to David, named Jonathan, but special mention is made, in 1 Chronicles 20:7 and 2 Samuel 21:21, of a nephew, son of Shimea, who rendered valuable service, and u-hose name was Jonathan. It is possible that the Hebrew דּור may mean \"nephew,\" as simply meaning \"relative.\" It must be admitted, however, as very remarkable, that in Leviticus, Numbers, the historical books, Jeremiah, and Amos, to the number of sixteen times in all, the word confessedly means \"uncle;\" while this seventeenth time, it would appear to mean \"nephew.\" On the other hand, in Proverbs, Canticles, Isaiah, Ezekiel, to the number of thirty-six times in all, the word follows its other branch of signification of \"love,\" and in particular \"one beloved.\" Nothing certain can be said of the Jehiel of this verse, but, if a son of Hachmoni, we may presume him to have been related to Jashobeam of ver. 2 and 1 Chronicles 11:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahithophel was the king's counseller: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - For Hushai the Archite, see 2 Samuel 15:32, 37; 2 Samuel 16:16; 2 Samuel 17:14, 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles27:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The after of this verse may possibly be the after of time, i.e. after the death of Ahithophel, instead of the after of place, i.e. subordinate. Jehoiada the son of Benaiah. Either the individual of ver. 5; 1 Chronicles 18:17; 2 Samuel 8:18; 2 Samuel 20:23, is not the person here intended, or we have here the names accidently reversed. There seems no sufficient reason to doubt that the high priest of the Ithamar branch is here meant.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - One Hebrew word (שׂרֵי) stands for the princes (twice), captains (three times), and stewards (once) of this verse. The classification of the verso speaks for itself. There are the princes of Israel; i.q. the princes of the tribes (1 Chronicles 27:16, 22). Otherwise the former of these expressions may be of an entirely generic kind, and apply to all that succeeds. There are, secondly, the princes of the twelve military companies... by course of the months (1 Chronicles 27:1-15). Thirdly, there are the princes of thousands and hundreds (Deuteronomy 1:15; 1 Samuel 8:12; 1 Samuel 17:18; 1 Samuel 18:13; 1 Samuel 23:7; 1 Chronicles 12:14; 1 Chronicles 27:1). There follow, fourthly, the princes of all the substance and cattle of the king, and (as seems to be added here) of his sons. There can be no doubt that the Hebrew text does say this, and does not merely register the fact of the attendance and presence of the sons of the king, as also it does not specialize the attendance of Solomon himself, though it is certain that he was present. Otherwise it may be doubtful, considering the facts of the occasion, and comparing 1 Chronicles 29:24, whether the original document is not misrepresented here. Next, fifthly, mention is made of the officers (סָרִיסִים), the Hebrew for which word generally means \"eunuch,\" and such use of it must have become much more familiar during and after the Captivity, and, therefore, of course, at the time of the compilation of this work; but it does not necessarily mean it. Eunuchs are never mentioned elsewhere in David's reign. There is no reason to suppose the word means \"eunuch,\" for instance, in Genesis 37:36; Genesis 39:1; 1 Samuel 8:15; 1 Kings 22:9; 2 Kings 24:12; 2 Kings 25:19; Jeremiah 34:19. Under any circumstances, it would seem unnecessary that such officers of a royal establishment as eunuchs should be under summoned that description to an assembly of this kind. Sixthly, the mighty men (1 Chronicles 11:10-25) were called to the assembly. And perhaps a seventh division may be made of all the valiant men (1 Chronicles 11:26-40), who belonged to other places, or who were at this time more especially in Jerusalem, as residents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The expression, David the king stood up upon his feet, probably means to emphasize the fact that hitherto, having been in a sitting or recumbent position, owing to his age and infirmity, he now with effort forced himself to stand in the presence of the unusual congregation and in consideration of what he felt was due to the occasion. He had not lost the man and the brother in his official and exalted rank, and, following ancient precedents (Genesis 29:4; Judges 19:23; 2 Samuel 19:12), he addresses the congregation as my brethren, and my people. David says he had it in his heart to build a house of rest, i.e. an abiding house (Psalm 132:8, 14) for the ark of the covenant, instead of the moving one, and for the footstool of our God. By this he means the mercy-seat, to which especial allusion is made ver. 11 (בֵּת הַכַּפֹרֶת). God is often spoken of as \"dwelling between the cherubim,\" and sometimes (Psalm 99:1) as \"sitting between the cherubim,\" which were over the lid of the ark, called the mercy-seat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The contents of this verse are stated, as already seen, even more forcibly in 1 Chronicles 22:8; while far less forcibly in 2 Samuel 7:5; 1 Kings 5:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - David mentions himself as the elect of God among all the members of his father's family, and from thence is led to trace the call from the first, by the following steps: - The tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:8; 1 Chronicles 5:2); the house of Jesse (1 Samuel 16:1); thirdly, of himself (1 Samuel 16:13); and lastly of Solomon (1 Chronicles 22:9, 10; 1 Chronicles 17:11-14; 2 Samuel 7:12-16). The exact time and method of David's receiving the identification of Solomon as the son to succeed him, is nowhere given. The throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. This expression, not found in its entirety elsewhere, is an emphatic statement here of the true theocracy, which should have ever prevailed among the people of Israel, and which is now paralleled by the kingship of the Lord in his own Church (1 Chronicles 17:14; 1 Chronicles 29:23). The solemn and most distinct proviso, If he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day, reminds us of Psalm 132:12. This proviso is emphatically presented again to the attention of Solomon, when the time comes for the direct appeal of God to him (1 Kings 3:14; 1 Kings 8:61; 1 Kings 9:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-10. - The double charge of these verses, first to the people and then to Solomon, is full of force and majesty. Translate, Now therefore in the sight of all Israel - the congregation of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God (\"Hear me,\" ver. 2), keep ye and study to do all the commandments of the Lord your God (Deuteronomy 4:21, 26; Deuteronomy 30:19; Leviticus 25:46; Jeremiah 3:18). The. expression, Know thou the God of thy father, for a practical knowledge and fear of God, is analogous with the expression, \"Hear thou,\" for the matter of practical obedience; e.g. \"If they hear not Moses and the prophets\" (Luke 16:32). Although there are not very many instances of this use of the word \"know,\" its antiquity and classical character may be considered guaranteed by such passages as Job 18:21; 1 Samuel 2:12; Proverbs 3:6; Psalm 36:10; Jeremiah 9:2; Hosea 5:4; Hosea 6:3. The expression, \"the God of thy father,\" evidently intended to be touching, is more fully given in ver. 20, \"God, even my God, will be with thee,\" which in its turn reminds us of Paul's language, \"But my God shall supply all your need\" (Philippians 4:19). The urgent entreaty on the part of David breathes in every sentence of it, thought, and a mode of presentation of it, feeling, and depth of conviction, with which we are familiar in his psalms. He speaks from his own varied, remarkable, and rich experience of the Divine care and jealous love, and from much personal experience of the deceitfulness of the heart, to Solomon, into whom, were it possible, he would pour the advantage of all he had learned, and from whom he would hide nothing of his intense and anxious solicitude. To the same strain he returns in ver. 20, but there with more exclusive reference to the undertaking of the building of \"the house of the Lord,\" or the house for the sanctuary. One thing only fails, perhaps, to be made quite apparent from the language of David, viz. why he deemed it necessary to urge so strenuously on Solomon the enterprise of building the temple and of carrying it to completion. With abundance of means and preparations so large already made, one might have supposed a young king and a young man would have needed little pressure and little exhortation. Nevertheless, in the manifest presence of David's words, it is very far from impossible to suppose the dangers and temptations of Solomon's position as constituting a serious risk.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-19. - These hints respecting the parts of the building that was to be, and respecting the furniture of it, will come in for fuller consideration in the fuller treatment of them, found in the narration of the actual construction of the building in 2 Chronicles compared with 2 Kings 6, etc. It is evident that David desired to make a solemn and set business of handing over even the patterns and plans. Nor is this under any circumstances wonderful, but least of all considering their Divine origin. The Divine original of the tabernacle and all its belongings (Exodus 25-30; Hebrews 8:5) was not to be a neglected precedent as regards the greater temple. It is said that \"David gave\" these \"patterns to Solomon his son\" (ver. 11), and the form in which he gave them is explained in ver. 19. There we read, \"The whole in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he made me to understand - all the works of this pattern.\" Whatever we generally accept respecting the writing of the tables of the Law by the finger of God (Exodus 24:12; Exodus 31:18; Exodus 32:15, 16; Deuteronomy 4:13; Deuteronomy 5:5, 22; Deuteronomy 9:10), is at all events open for acceptance here. At the same time, the phraseology of our nineteenth verse is certainly not so uncompromising-as that of the references just instanced from the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The words of ver. 19 may be satisfied by the meaning that David was in such manner and degree \"in the Spirit\" (Revelation 1:10), that in the writing and the drawing of patterns his hand was entirely under the guidance of that Spirit. In either alternative, to hand over such documents and such \"patterns\" must have been felt by David and all present an act of which much should be made. Verse 11. - The patterns of six parts of the future building are here delivered over to Solomon.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The porch; הָאוּלָם (1 Kings 6:3; 1 Kings 7:6; Ezekiel 40:7; Ezekiel 8:16; Joel 2:17; 2 Chronicles 3:4, where we read that the length was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty cubits; 2 Chronicles 8:12; 15:8; 29:7, 17); Septuagint, τὸ αἰλὰμ τοῦ rang generally, but in this verse τοῦ ναοῦ is all that appears. This porch was built on the east of the temple.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The houses thereof; i.e. not of the porch, but of the whole building; בָּתָּיו; Septuagint, τῶν οἴκων αὐτοῦ. The word \"houses\" in this place designates the\" greater house,\" or\" temple,\" or holy place of 2 Chronicles 3:5; 1 Kings 6:5, 17; and the \"inner house,\" or \"oracle,\" or \"most holy house,\" or \"holy of holies,'\" of 2 Chronicles 3:8; 1 Kings 6:19-27.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The treasuries thereof; נַנְזַכָּיו, a word found only here in this form, with a Chaldee termination in אַּך; Septuagint, τῶν ζακχῶν αὐτοῦ. The treasuries were chambers for receiving gifts, and storing the treasures new or old of the temple. Which of the rooms that were built against the sides of the temple were set apart as these treasure- chambers is not known. Perhaps they were the three-storied wings of the temple (1 Kings 6:5).NEWLINENEWLINE4. The upper chambers thereof; עֲלִיּתֹיָו; Septuagint, τῶν ὑπερώωνι (for fuller treatment of these, see 2 Chronicles 3:9). We may only with confidence say of these chambers that they were upper chambers, but whether over the \"oracle\" as Keil and Bertheau think, or over the \"porch,\" or the higher of those, that leaned against the sides of the main building, it is impossible to determine from such data as we at present have.NEWLINENEWLINE5. The inner parlours thereof; חֲדָרָיו הַפְגִימִים, Septuagint τῶν ἀποθηκῶν τῶν ἐσωτέρων. There can be little doubt that these designate the lower rooms of the side buildings of the holy place, and perhaps also of the porch.NEWLINENEWLINE6. The plane of the mercy-seat; בֵּית הַכַּפֹרֶת; Septuagint, τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐξιλασμοῦ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Bertheau, Keil, and some others regard the spirit here spoken of as referring to the spirit and mind of David, and Bertheau goes so far as to translate, or paraphrase, \"the pattern of all that floated before his mind.\" Such manifest stress has been laid upon the two facts - that the patterns were of God's giving, and that they were now in such form that they could be given over into the hands of Solomon - that such an interpretation seems inadmissible. Rather translate, And the pattern of all which was by the spirit with him. For the courts of the house of the Lord, see 1 Kings 6:36; 2 Chronicles 4:9. The chambers round about; הַלְּשָׁכות סָבִיב(1 Chronicles 23:28). There seems no necessity to suppose that these chambers were separate from the building. For the treasuries, the correct translation is the treasures (1 Chronicles 26:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This verse either continues the subject of the giving of the patterns, which will read rather harshly, as preceding the courses of the priests and the Levites, and could only mean directions or instructions for their interchange, etc.; or it may continue the subject of the \"chambers round about\" \"for the treasures of the house of God,\" etc., also for the convenience \"of the courses of the priests,\" etc., and \"for all the work,\" etc., and for keeping \"all the vessels of service,\" etc. Bertheau and Keil somewhat scout the former supposition, and adhere to the latter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - The general meaning of these verses is that, if the question were one of gold, or one of silver, David assigned for each vessel and each part of the candlesticks, the proportionate weight of gold that was to be employed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So tot, as regards the tables of shewbread, whether in sort of gold or of silver, he assigned the due weight of metal for either sort. We should have been at a loss to understand the plural here employed, showing more than one table (Exodus 25:23; 1 Kings 7:48; 2 Chronicles 29:18), but for 2 Chronicles 4:8, 19; in the former of which verses we read of \"ten tables\" being made and placed on \"the right side and on the left, in the temple,\" and in the latter verse, yet more distinctly, of \"tables, whereon the shewbread was set.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - It is to be observed that the term basons (פְורִים), which appear to have been covered goblets, is only found here and in Ezra 1:10; Ezra 8:27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - By the chariot of the cherubims, is of course not meant that the cherubim had a chariot, but that they constituted the chariot of Jehovah (Psalm 18:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - This abrupt bringing in of David as the speaker himself has already had one illustration in 1 Chronicles 23:5. (See on the matter of this verse, note on per. 11; and comp. 2 Kings 3:15 for the parallel of an expression which evidently intends to assert an inspiring hand of the Lord.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - These verses, as above seen, continue and close David's urgent and last exhortation to Solomon. He has now done with admonition and urgent appeal, but he offers prayer for him (1 Chronicles 29:19).

The additional expression here is to be noticed, whom alone God hath chosen. By this plea, full of truth as it was, we may suppose that David would shelter himself from any possible blame or reflection on the part of the people, from the charge of partiality on the part of his elder children, and any unjust slight to them, and also from any self-reproach, in that he was devolving such a responsible task on so young and tender a man. Palace. This word (הַבִּירָה), by which the temple is designated here and in ver. 19, seems to be very probably a word of Persian derivation. It is found in Nehemiah 1:1; in Daniel 8:2; but very frequently in Esther, where it is used not only of \"Shushan the palace\" (Esther 1:2; Esther 2:3; Esther 3:15), as the royal abode, but also of the special part of the city adjoining the palace proper (Esther 1:5; Esther 2:5; Esther 8:14; Esther 9:6). The word is found also in Nehemiah 2:8; but there it carries the signification of the fortress of the temple. There may be some special appropriateness in its use here, in consideration of the circumstance of the fortifications and wall, which flanked the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The six designations of stones in this verse are as follows: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Onyx stones; שֹׁהַם (Genesis 2:12; Exodus 25:7; Exodus 28:9; Exodus 35:9; Exodus 39:6; Job 28:16; Ezekiel 28:13).NEWLINENEWLINE2. Stones to be set מִלּוּאִים or מִלֻּאִים (Exodus 25:7; Exodus 35:9, 27; the feminine form of the same word is found in Exodus 28:17, 20; Exodus 39:13). The other meanings of this word are inauguration to the priest's office (Leviticus 8:33), and the sacrifice of inauguration (Leviticus 7:37).NEWLINENEWLINE3. Glistering stones; פִּוּך Gesenius says this is the same root with φῦκος, seaweed. From this seaweed an alkaline pigment was prepared, which came to be called by the same word. This Hebrew word also meant a \"dye\" made from stribium, the Latin name of antimony (Septuagint, στιμμί: Vulgate, stibium), with which Hebrew women stained their eyelashes (see also 2 Kings 9:30; Isaiah 54:11; Jeremiah 4:30). Gesenius would translate here \"stones of pigment,\" and understands them to mean possibly marble for covering, as though with a solid paint, the walls.NEWLINENEWLINE4. Stones of divers colours; רִקְמָה. This word, which means \"variegated,\" is only in this passage applied to stones. It is applied once to the feathers of the eagle (Ezekiel 17:3); but almost always to needlework or garments, often being translated in the Authorized Version as \"broidered\" (Judges 5:30; Psalm 45:15; Ezekiel 16:10, 13, 18; Ezekiel 26:16; Ezekiel 27:7, 16, 24).NEWLINENEWLINE5. All manner of precious stones. The feminine form, יִקָרָה. The simplest idea of the word is \"heavy,\" thence precious, dear, rare (2 Samuel 12:30; 1 Kings 5:31 [1 Kings 5:17]; 1 Kings 7:9; 10:2; 1 Chronicles 20:2; 2 Chronicles 3:6; 2 Chronicles 9:1; Job 28:16; Job 31:26; Proverbs 1:13; Proverbs 3:15; Isaiah 28:16; Ezekiel 28:13; Daniel 11:38).NEWLINENEWLINE6. Marble stones; שַׁיִשׁ, the elementary idea of which is whiteness. This word is found only here; Septuagint and Vulgate, \"Parian marble.\" A word akin (שֵׁשׁ), meaning also \"white marble\" is found in Esther 1:6; Song of Solomon 5:16. The further treatment of these stones will be found on 2 Chronicles 3:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Translate, And, moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, what I have as mine own treasure of gold and of silver I have given to the house of my God, over and above all I have prepared for the holy house. The word סְגֻּלָּה, on the seven other occasions of its use (Exodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 7:6; Deuteronomy 14:2; Deuteronomy 26:18; Psalm 135:4; Ecclesiastes 2:8; Malachi 3:17), is found in the Authorized Version as \"peculiar treasure\" or \"special treasure\" and once \"jewels,\" but in every instance it is evident that the specialness denoted is at one with the idea of the affection that is borne by a person to his own possession and property.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Respecting the uncertainty of the amounts here denoted, even if the numbers of the present text be accepted as correct, see note on 1 Chronicles 22:14. Bertheau and Keil make three thousand talents of gold the equivalent of thirteen millions and a half of our money, and seven thousand talents of silver the equivalent of two and a half millions of our money - or, if the royal shekel instead of the sacred be supposed to be the standard, they make them the half of those two amounts respectively. Others calculate the value of the gold to reach thirty millions, and of the silver three millions of our money (see Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., pp. 63-65, 81). The situation of Ophir is still considered undetermined. The other occasions on which it is mentioned are as follows: - Genesis 10:29 (1 Chronicles 1:23); 1 Kings 9:28; 1 Kings 10:11; 1 Kings 22:49; 2 Chronicles 8:18; 2 Chronicles 9:10; Job 22:24; Job 28:16; Psalm 45:10; Isaiah 13:12. It must be understood also that it is to it that allusion is made in 1 Kings 10:22, where we read that silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks, beside the gold, were imported into Judaea from it. The \"almug\" tree is also said to have been brought in the same ships which brought the gold of Ophir. The Septuagint always translates by some form of the word Σουφίς (except in Genesis 10:29), which word comes very near the Coptic name for India. There is also a place in India, mentioned by Ptolemy, Ammianus, and Abulfeda, the site of the present emporium of Goa, called Σουπάρα, and which would explain Both the Hebrew and the Septuagint words. An Indian site for Ophir would also well suit the mention of the ivory and the particular wood which the ships brought. On the other hand, the first occasion of this name Ophir finds it placed among the tribes of Joktan's descendants, who occupied South Arabia. It is there (Genesis 10:29; 1 Chronicles 1:23) placed between Sheba and Havilah, beth abounding in gold. There are other considerations that favour Arabia. Many other places have been suggested, and some of them supported by respectable authorities, such as Eastern Africa, South America and Peru, Phrygia, etc. If there be a real question about it, to the prejudice of Arabia, it would be to India we must look. That some of the commodities brought belonged more especially to India, though even in that case the majority belonged undoubtedly to Arabia, is very true. This circumstance throws great probability into the suggestion that whether Ophir were in Arabia or India, it was a great emporium, and not simply an exporter of its own particular produce (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub voce; Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The last sentence of this verse certainly says that the destined use of the refined silver, as well as of the gold of Ophir, was to overlay the walls of the houses. We know that gold was used for this purpose (2 Chronicles 3:5-10). But we do not read of the silver being used for overlaying purposes. We also read that none of the drinking-vessels of Solomon were of silver, as \"it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon\" (1 Kings 10:21; 2 Chronicles 9:20). It is possible, the order of the-sentences notwithstanding, that the mention of the refined silver is only to pro-pare the way for the contents of ver. 5, and that it mast not be applied to the last sentence of our present verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Authorized Version, to consecrate his service, might in this instance seem to be not merely an inaccurate but an incorrect translation. For David's evident meaning was, after rehearsing his own example, to base on it the appeal, Who is... willing to bring all ungrudging handful this day to the Lord? and 2 Chronicles 13:9 might perhaps be cited as a confirmatory instance. But on the other hand, the idiom was evidently, by the witness of many passages, a general one, and the meaning of it is not incorrectly conveyed in the Authorized Version, where service means in every ease active and practical help (Exodus 28:41; Exodus 29:9; Exodus 32:29; Numbers 3:3, etc.). The question now is not one of consecrating heart and affection, but rather of giving the practical proof of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The response was hearty; it comprised voluntary gifts from the most of those mentioned in 1 Chronicles 28:1; and described in 1 Chronicles 27:16-31. For the rulers of the king's work, see 1 Chronicles 27:26; 1 Chronicles 28:1. As the more general term \"work\" is employed, we are not bound to confine the expression to include only those who managed \"the substance and cattle\" of 1 Chronicles 28:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The Authorized Version translation drams occurs also twice in Ezra and twice in Nehemiah. There is no doubt that the coin referred to is the Persian daric, with which the Jews became familiar during the time of their exile. The Hebrew word appears in three different forms.NEWLINENEWLINE1. As אֲדַרְכְּמון; here and Ezra 8:27.NEWLINENEWLINE2. As דַּרְכְּמון; Ezra 2:69; Nehemiah 7:70-72.NEWLINENEWLINE3. As דַּכְרוֹן; in rabbinical writings, but not in Scripture.NEWLINENEWLINERespecting the possible derivations of the words in the first and second forms, see Gesenins's 'Lexicon,' sub voce, and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible' (2nd edit., p. 181). The obverse of the coin shows the image of a king, with bow and spear. The value of the coin is variously computed at thirteen shillings and sixpence or twenty. two shillings and sixpence. Keil suggests that the mention of darics as well as talents in this verse may point to some of the gold being contributed in the shape of coin instead of talents-weight. This does not seem likely, however, because, of course, the daric itself was not in use in Jerusalem in David's time, and any gold coin that was then in use might have received mention on its own account, even if translated also into the daric. The Septuagint translates in this verse merely by the word χρυσοῦς, the Vulgate by solidos. Under any circumstances, the coin is to be distinguished from the δραχνή. Specimens of the daric, both in gold and silver, exist in the Paris and Vienna Museums. The Hebrew word for the ten thousand preceding the so-called drams of this verse is the word for \"myriad\" (רִבּו, a shortened form of רבּות), found also in Ezra 2:64; Nehemiah 7:66; Daniel 11:12; Jonah 4:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For Jehiel, see 1 Chronicles 23:7, 8; 1 Chronicles 26:20-22; and for the stones contributed among the other gifts, see Exodus 35:9, 27. Of the same chapter in Exodus, especially in its vers. 4-9 and 20-29, the whole of our present passage so vividly reminds us that the difficulty might be to doubt that it was present as a model to the mind of David himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-20. - The majesty and comprehensiveness of this passage - a national liturgy of itself-are in direct proportion to the brevity of it. It includes adoration, acknowledgment of the inherent nature of human dependence, self-humiliation, and confession, dedication of all the offerings, and prayer both for the whole people in general, and for Solomon in particular, in view of his future position and responsibilities. Its utter repudiation of all idea of meritoriousness is very striking. The traces are visible of what may be called snatches of memory on the part of David from various religious odes of his own authorship, as well as from those of others still on record, as, for instance, especially in vers. 14-17, compared with passages in Psalm 24; Psalm 50; Psalm 89, ; Psalm 39; Psalm 90; Psalm 102; Psalm 144; Psalm 7; Psalm 17; and 139. But the unity of this service is abundantly conspicuous, and every sentence seems weighed and measured for the occasion. The scene, reaching its climax in what is recorded in ver. 20, must have been one of the utmost religious grandeur and impressiveness. It is true that the very last clause, which couples the reverence done on the part of the assembled multitude to the king, with that done to Jehovah himself, strikes us as an unfortunate conjunction. It does not, indeed, need upon its merits any vindication, considering the tenor of all which has preceded; but it may be felt an extenuation of the form in which the expression occurs, if we suppose (as we justly may) that the people viewed their act in the light of part of their religious service at that particular time. In 1 Kings 1:31 the same words express the reverence paid to David, though in numerous other passages they mark that offered to God (Exodus 4:31; 2 Chronicles 29:20; Nehemiah 8:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Of the seven other clear occasions of occurrence of the word here translated abiding (מִקְוֶה), it bears three times the meaning of \"a gathering together\" as of waters (Genesis 1:10; Exodus 7:19; Leviticus 11:36). The other four times it is translated in the Authorized Version \"hope,\" either in the abstract (Ezra 10:2), or in the personal object of it (Jeremiah 14:8; Jeremiah 17:13; Jeremiah 50:7). Probably the word \"abiding,\" as drawn from this latter aspect of the word, expresses with sufficient accuracy the intended meaning here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - It may very possibly be that the stress with which David here says, I know, had its special cause. The thought of God as one who \"tried\" the heart is one often brought out in David's psalms, but a strong conviction of it may have been wrought in David's mind by Samuel's rehearsal of the language God used to him at the very time of the election of David from amid all the other of Jesse's sons (1 Samuel 16:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - In the imagination of the thoughts of the heart. We have here again a reminiscence of the early language of Genesis (Genesis 6:5; Genesis 8:21. See also our book, 1 Chronicles 28:9; Deuteronomy 31:21). This same word for \"imagination\" (יֵצֶר) is found in the Authorized Version in Isaiah 26:3, \"Whose mind is stayed,\" etc.; and in Psalm 103:14; Isaiah 29:16; Habakkuk 2:18; in the last three passages translated as \"frame,\" \"framed,\" and \"work.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For the palace, see ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God.

Verse 21. - In this verse the distinction is to be noticed between the sacrifices of thank offerings (זְבָחִים); those of burnt offerings (עֹלום); and their drink offerings, i.e the drink offerings that went with them (נִסְכֵּיחֶם). For the first of these the more specific Hebrew word is שְׁלָמִים (Leviticus 7:20; Leviticus 9:4) or זֶבַחָ שְׁלָמִים (Leviticus 3:1; Leviticus 7:11, 13, 15; Numbers 7:17). The breast and right shoulder were the priest's share. All the rest belonged to the person who sacrificed, and his friends, and must be eaten the same or the next day (Leviticus 7:11-18, 29-34). Other particulars may be found in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1470, 1471. The last clause of our verse tells us how ample was the feast provided by these sacrifices on this occasion, being in abundance for all Israel The burnt offering is first mentioned in Genesis 8:20; it is the only sacrifice that the Book of Genesis (see Genesis 15:9, etc.; Genesis 22:2, etc.) knows. The offering (מִנְחָה) of Genesis 4:4 is somewhat obscure, but does not appear to have been a sacrifice of blood. This sacrifice was one which was wholly consumed on the altar of fire, and supposed to ascend to heaven. The chief kinds of burnt offerings wereNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the daily (Exodus 29:38-42; Numbers 28:3-8);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the sabbath (Numbers 28:8-10);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that at the new moon, the Day of Atonement, the three great festivals and the Feast of Trumpets (Numbers 28:11-29:39).NEWLINENEWLINEBeside these, there were the several kinds of freewill and private burnt offerings. The first, seventh, and eighth chapters of Leviticus contain full accounts of the ceremonial. The drink offering is spoken of as early as Genesis 35:14; but those to which reference is here made as appertaining to the before-mentioned sacrifices are more explicitly spoken of in such passages as Exodus 29:40; Leviticus 23:13; Numbers 6:17; Numbers 15:5-24; Numbers 28:10-14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Evident stress is laid upon the eating and drinking of that day as before the Lord, and upon the anointing of Solomon to the Lord. This latter expression is more forcible than the former. The second time of making Solomon king is explained by 1 Kings 1:32-40; 1 Chronicles 23:1. The statement that Zadok was anointed to be priest must probably be understood to describe, either the re-anointing of him (just as \"they made Solomon king the second time\") on an occasion which particularly invited it; or an anointing which had not been before fully performed. This latter is, perhaps, an unlikely supposition; but at the same time, the fact of any previous ceremony of the kind does not happen to be narrated. Zadok had been joint priest with Abiatbar of the line of Ithamar (1 Chronicles 15:11; 2 Samuel 24, 29; 19:11); but now he was anointed under circumstances of special publicity, and at a crisis of special interest, to supersede Abiathar. who had sided with Adonijah, and who was early to be removed altogether from the sacred office (1 Kings 1:7, 8, 32, 38, 44, 45; 1 Kings 2:26, 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For the happy expression, the throne of the Lord, see 1 Chronicles 28:5. And for evidence that Solomon did really exercise royal authority before David's death, see 1 Kings 1:32, 45-48; 1 Kings 2:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Any king before him in Israel. There were, of course, only two kings \"before\" Solomon in Israel. The promise of God to Solomon, however, when he was \"pleased\" with the speech of the prayer which he offered a very short time subsequently, was much larger, and suggests itself to us as what may really have been present to the mind of the historian when he used the less comprehensive words above (2 Chronicles 1:12; 1 Kings 4:12, 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-30. - These verses contain last words respecting David's reign, its extent and its length; respecting his death and age, and the succession of Solomon; and respecting the sources of the history of himself, his reign, his people, and other countries. Verse 26. - The words of this verse, not indeed hard to follow here, but marking the close instead of the commencement or career of David's reign over all Israel, are paralleled by the earlier passage, 1 Chronicles 18:14; 2 Samuel 8:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - In the same way the contents of this verse are paralleled by 1 Chronicles 3:4; 2 Samuel 5:5; 1 Kings 2:11; this last passage giving only seven years instead of the seven years and six months for the reign in Hebron.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - We learn from 2 Samuel 5:4, 5, that David was thirty years old when he began to reign in Hebron. He must, therefore, have died in his seventy-first year. That this is called here a good old age shows that the length of human life had now greatly subsided. In comparison of all his successors on the thrones of Judah and of Israel, his age was clearly a \"good old age?'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The Hebrew word here translated acts is identical with the words translated three times afterwards in this verse book. A uniform rendering for all might be found in the general word \"history\" or \"acts.\" The question as to the probable nature of these works, and whether identical with our Books of Samuel, has been treated of in the Introduction. The Hebrew word for \"seer,\" applied in this verse to Samuel, is הָרֹאֶה. And that applied to Gad, though the Authorized Version has the same translation, \"seer,\" is הָחזֶה. There can be no doubt that the word applied to Samuel would, under any circumstances, stand as the higher of the two names, were there any comparison intended between them. This is confirmed by the fact that it is found used only of him (1 Samuel 9:9, 11, 18, 19; 2 Samuel 15:27; 1 Chronicles 9:22; 1 Chronicles 26:28; 1 Chronicles 29:29) and of Hanani (2 Chronicles 16:7, 10), whereas the word applied to Gad in this verse is the generic name for seers, and is used several times in the Books of Chronicles of other persons than Gad. At the same time, the parenthesis in 1 Samuel 9:9, to the effect that the word here used of Samuel as seer (הָרֹאֶה) was superseded in later times (as, for instance, at the time of the writing of the Books of Samuel) by the word prophet (נֶבִיא), compared with Isaiah 30:10, points in a somewhat different direction. In the first place, it would indicate that our Authorized Version in Isaiah 30:10 should rather stand, \"Which say to the prophets, Prophesy not, and to the seers,\" etc. While for our present passage it would indicate that no insidious comparison is possible between Samuel and Gad as seers, but rather that Samuel retains the old honoured name by which he had been wont to be called, and that to Nathan is with equal naturalness attached the more modern name - the functions represented being essentially the same, or at least analogous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles29:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The phrase in this verse, The times that went over him, is noticeable as an hapax legomenon. There are, however, not a few phrases more or less nearly approaching it in sense, and all hinging on the word times (1 Chronicles 12:32; Esther 1:13; Job 24:1; Psalm 31:15; Daniel 7:25). The last sentence of this chapter is illustrated, and most suggestively, by 2 Chronicles 12:8; 2 Chronicles 17:10, 11, 22-30; Ezra 9.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the sons of Israel; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - 1. TABLE OF ISRAEL'S TWELVE SONS. The twelve sons of Israel, not in the order of age (cf. Genesis 29:31-30:24; Genesis 35:16-19), nor exactly in the order of children of wives as against those of handmaids (Genesis 25:23-26), nor in that of the aged father's dying blessing (Genesis 49.), nor in that of Exodus 1:2-4. It is the place of Dan which disturbs the fittest order, and Keil suggests that his place in this text is accounted for by Rachel's desire that her handmaid's child should be accounted her own; but surely this was not exceptional, but applied to all or most of such cases, and should have been far rather taken into consideration in any of the other lists than in this. However accounted for, the order is - lest, the six sons of the first wife Leah; secondly, the elder son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah; thirdly, the two sons of the loved wife Rachel; fourthly, the other son of Rachel's handmaid Billah; lastly, the two sons of Zilpah, handmaid of Leah. As this order corresponds with nothing in our Old Testament, it may serve as one slight indication that the compiler of Chronicles was not dependent on these records alone. The Hebrew text and the Septuagint accord exactly with the Authorized Version here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDan, Joseph, and Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: which three were born unto him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and he slew him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-9. - 2. THE LINE OF JUDAH, TO HIS THREE GREAT-GRANDSONS. The line of Judah is, with a well-known object, the first to be taken up, although Judah stands fourth of Israel's sons. Judah has five sons: three, Er, Onan, Shelah, by a Canaanitess, the daughter of Shad; and two, Pharez and Zerah, by Tamar, his own daughter-in-law, under the circumstances described (Genesis 38:6-30). There all these names are found in exact accord in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint. The Septuagint Version, however (Genesis 38:2), by an evident inaccuracy of translation, gives Shua as the name, not of the father, but of the daughter, ῇ ὄνομα Σαυά. Parallel passages are also found (Genesis 46:12; Numbers 26:19-22). Er and Onan died without issue, and the descendants of Shelah are not mentioned till we reach 1 Chronicles 4:21-23. The line is now carried on by the twin sons of Tamar (vers. 5, 6). Pharez, with two sons, Hezron and Hamul (Genesis 46:12; Ruth 4:18), and Zerah, with five sons, Zimri (or Zabdi, Joshua 7:1), Ethan, Heman, Calcol, Dara (or with many manuscripts, followed by the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic versions, Darda). If these last four names are not identical with those in 1 Kings 4:31, they are not to be found in any available connection elsewhere, and the last two not at all. Upon this supposition, it is held by some that this very passage proves that the compiler drew on resources not possessed by us. The weight of evidence seems, however, largely in favour of the persons being the same. (See Gilbert Barrington's 'Old Testament Genealogies,' 1:206-208, well summarized in art. \"Darda,\" Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' for as competent a discussion of the question as the present data will allow.) It needs to be constantly remembered that an enumeration like the above, of five so-called sons, does not necessarily involve their being five brothers, although in this case it looks the more as though they were so, as it is said five of them in allNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah.

Joshua 7:1-18 supplies the missing link, and states that Carmi is son of Zimri (Zabdi), one of the aforesaid seven grandsons. By the punishment of death, visited upon this Achar, with his sons and daughters (Joshua 7:24, 25), it may be presumed that the line of Judah through him became extinct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Ethan; Azariah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The line through Ethan, another of the seven grandsons, seems to stop with Azariah, a name found nowhere else.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons also of Hezron, that were born unto him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9.-3.

Nathaneel, Raddai (but see 1 Kings 1:8), and Ozem. But, on the other hand, they make it appear that David was the seventh of seven, instead of (1 Samuel 14:10, 11; 1 Samuel 17:12) the eighth of eight sons. The missing son, any way, belongs to the seventh place. The Syriac and Arabic versions have taken the Elihu of 1 Chronicles 27:18, and put him in this place. Others, following the Septuagint, suppose this Elihu, if strictly a brother of David, to be Eliab, the oldest. The explanation of the absence of the name here may be that he died early and without issue, and would accordingly be the less wanted in a genealogical register.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNethaneel the fourth, Raddai the fifth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOzem the sixth, David the seventh:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose sisters were Zeruiah, and Abigail. And the sons of Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - These verses do not say that David \"begat\" Zeruiah and Abigail, but that these two were sisters of the foregoing seven brethren. Light is thrown upon this by 2 Samuel 17:25, which says that Abigail was the daughter of one Nahash, and that Zeruiah was her sister. But it is to leave us in greater darkness as to who Nahath was: whether Nahath was another name for Jesse, or the name of Jesse's wife, or the name of a former husband of Jesse's wife, to whom she bore these two daughters before she became wife to Jesse, and that former husband possibly none other than the Ammonite king (2 Samuel 10:2) - or whether none of these conjectures be near the truth, some of which on the face of them seem unlikely enough, is as yet unsettled. Meantime it is worth remembering that Zeruiah named one of her celebrated sons, and probably the eldest of them, Abishai, after Jesse, Ishai being the same as our Jesse; yet from the above premises it is taken that she was strictly sister of Abigail, and therefore was not really related to Jesse. The subject is treated interestingly under the various names in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary.' The husband of Zeruiah is given nowhere, while the husband of Abigail, here called Jether the Ishmeelite, is, in the passage already referred to (2 Samuel 17:25), called Ithra (which is a slightly altered form of the name), an Israelite, with little doubt an error for Ishmaelite. In the same passage also her own name appears as אֲבִיגַל, instead of אֲבִיגַיִל, though many manuscripts have this latter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abigail bare Amasa: and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmeelite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth: her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - (C) Chelubai. The descendants of Caleb (Chelubai), placed third of Hezron's sons, are next dealt with; but the subject is almost immediately interrupted by resumed reference to Hezron (vers. 21-24), and by the table of Jemh-meel and his descendants (vers. 25-41); after which the table of Caleb, apparently the same Caleb, is carried on (vers. 42-49). Taking these broken portions, however, just as they come, we are immediately met by a series of uncertainties and surprises. Ver. 18 is obscure in that it says Caleb had children by Azubah (the Hebrew construction also unusual), a wife, or indeed strictly a woman (not even using the ordinary formula \"his wife\"), and by Jerioth, of whom nothing is said; and the verse adds obscurity by saying, her sons are these, without plainly indicating to which woman reference is made. It may be safely presumed, however, from what follows, that Azubah is intended, though no other part of Scripture helps us By so much as a mention of the sons' names to determine it certainly. Meantime one Hebrew manuscript and the Chaldee Paraphrase are found to omit the words \"and by Jerioth.\" The Vulgate, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, make Jerioth one of the children - possibly a daughter - of Caleb and Azubah, and this view is supported by Kennicott and Houbigant (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). The tone of ver. 19 may certainly he held to offer some countenance to the assumption that either Jerioth's name ought to appear as that of a child or not at all. The name Ephrath in this verse abounds with interest. The ancient name of the town of Bethlehem, and also apparently of a district round it, is the same word which is found here as the name of a woman. In either case it is more generally written אֶפְרָתָה, as even in the two other appearances of it in this very chapter. Two manuscripts, followed by two ancient editions, and apparently by the Vulgate, substitute aleph for the above final he. In Micah 5:1, Bethlehem is found united with Ephratah in one compound word. The mother Ephrath is here interesting for her descendants given, her son Hur, grandson Uri, and great-grandson Bezaleel. Further reference to these is made in ver. 50.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Azubah was dead, Caleb took unto him Ephrath, which bare him Hur.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead, whom he married when he was threescore years old; and she bare him Segub.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-24. - The first interruption to the record of Caleb's posterity is now occasioned by a resumed reference to Hezron, who at the age of threescore took to wife (as it seems from ver. 24) Abiah, sister to Gilead, daughter of the eminent man Machir, who was Manasseh's oldest son by an Aramitess concubine (1 Chronicles 7:14). Two sons of Hezron by Abiah are given (the latter of them a posthumous child), but the elder having a son called Jair tracked, no doubt as one who became famous by the number of cities he took. He was thus connected on the father's side with a great family of Judah, and on the mother's with a great family of Manasseh. He is probably not the Jair of Judges 10:3, with his \"thirty sons, thirty ass colts, and thirty cities.\" And יָאִיר (Ἰάειζος, Mark 5:22) is not יָעִיד of 2 Samuel 21:19; 1 Chronicles 20:5. Evident stress is laid on his maternal descent. Thus (Numbers 32:41) he is styled son of Manasseh, and hence also the explanation of the last clause of ver. 23, infra, all these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead. Some of the cities alluded to are the Havoth-Jair (Numbers 32:41; Deuteronomy 3:14; Joshua 13:30), Englished as the \"groups of dwellings of Jair,\" on which see interesting note in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine' (edit. 1866), vocabulary, pp. 526, 527. They lay in the trans-Jordanic district Trachonitis, the modern El-leyah and Jebel-Hauran. It is not possible to harmonize exactly the numbers of the cities given here with those in passages quoted above; nor is the translation of ver. 23, Authorized Version, very certainly the correct one. E. Bertheau, in his 'Die Bucher der Chronik erklart; 15. Kurzgef. exegetisches Handbuch. z. A.T.,' translates, \"And Geshur and Aram took the Havvoth-Jair from them with Kenath and her daughter-towns, sixty cities.\" \"Took\" is supposed to mean here \"retook,\" or \"recovered.\" Though this suits the Hebrew syntax better, it does not suit so well our immediate context; nor have we any other information of such re, covering of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even threescore cities. All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Geshur was a small district between Argob and Bashan; and Aram, commonly translated Syria, i.e. the ancient Syria, viz. the territory of Damascus. Kenath, rechristened by its subduer Nobah (Numbers 32:42), and retaining this name at the time of Gideon, and Zeba and Sahnunnah subsequently vindicated the life of its old name, and regained it, replaced in the present day by Kenawat. And the towns thereof; Hebrew literally, her daughters; i.e. the small, subordinate groups of people (Numbers 21:25, \"All the villages thereof,\" literally, daughters). All these belonged to the sons of Machir, the father of Gilead, might perhaps be open to the translation, \"All these were the possessions of Machir, the possessor of Gilead.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after that Hezron was dead in Calebephratah, then Abiah Hezron's wife bare him Ashur the father of Tekoa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The remaining verse of this section brings another point of difficulty unsolved yet. No place Caleb-ephratah is known, and no sort of accounting for Hezron dying anywhere but in Egypt, whither he went with Jacob (Genesis 46:12), is producible. The Vulgate has Ingressus est Caleb ad Ephratam, but our Hebrew text cannot be made to justify it, if for nothing else, for want of a preposition אֶל before \"Ephrata.\" This reading of the Vulgate has suggested to others that by a slight but still gratuitous alteration of our Hebrew text בָא might be substituted for the preposition בְּ prefixed to the name of Caleb; but upon that showing we have to suppose that Caleb did leave Egypt on his own account and travel to Ephratah, and then there fails any strong connection (but see Septuagint, in loc.) between that fact and what is said about Abiah. Still, the explanation might receive some countenance from the fact that it is said that Abiah's son became the father - or founder - of Tekoa, a place near Bethlehem, in South Judah (1 Samuel 30:14). Bertheau has at this point suggested that Caleb-ephratah, instead of being included in Neger-Caleb, may rather, in distinction from it, designate the northern portion of the territory of Caleb. The solution of the problem will probably not yield to anything but a justly restored text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-41. - We reach here the second interruption in the account of Caleb's posterity. (A) Jerahmeel, though the eldest Hezronite son, has as yet been passed by in favour of Ram and in favour of Caleb, so far as regards part of his descendants. Jerahmeel himself is mentioned nowhere else, but his people collectively are (1 Samuel 27:10; 1 Samuel 30:29). On the other hand, this place alone supplies the lists of names, and we have not the aid of any collation. Ver. 25 purports in the Authorized Version to give five sons of Jerahmeel by his first wife, of name not given. The absence of the conjunction \"and,\" however, in the Hebrew text before the last name, Ahijah, suggests that this may be the name of the first wife the presence of which seems greatly required by the contents of the next verse. Some particle being required, Le Clerc, accepting the suggestion of Junins and Tremellius, proposes to supply מֵאֵת, and Bertheau the same preposition, but in a simpler form, prefixed to the name Ahijah (see Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:180).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJerahmeel had also another wife, whose name was Atarah; she was the mother of Onam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For עְטָרָה, one manuscript has אָטֶר, and another קְטוּרָה.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Ram the firstborn of Jerahmeel were, Maaz, and Jamin, and Eker.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Onam were, Shammai, and Jada.

These two names are abundantly interesting here. Zabad, the tenth from Jerahmeel, or fourteenth from the patriarch Judah himself, brings us to the time of David, by exactly the same interval as seven other perfect genealogies, four of these having the very same number of steps, viz. fourteen, two having fifteen, and that of David himself having eleven steps. An analogous and equally interesting correspondence can be traced with the name Azariah. See the important art. \"Zabad,\" Smith's 'Bible Dictionary;' and its further remarks as to the evidence of the genealogy in the fact of its twenty-fourth and last name tallying well with the time of Hezekiah, the sixth king after Athaliah (1 Chronicles 4:41).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Azariah begat Helez, and Helez begat Eleasah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Eleasah begat Sisamai, and Sisamai begat Shallum,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shallum begat Jekamiah, and Jekamiah begat Elishama.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 42-49. - These verses are occupied with the resumption of descendants of Caleb - the Caleb apparently of vers. 9 and 18, though, this being so, the last clause in ver. 49, the daughter of Caleb, Achsa, will require accounting for. This statement would lead us to suppose that we were assuredly reading of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; but it cannot be so. The name of Caleb, with the questions gathering round it, will be best considered here. Of the nine times in which it occurs in this chapter, the mere duplicates (of vers. 20, 46, 48) may be at once counted off. The compound \"Caleb-ephratah\" of ver. 24 has been already dealt with. Nor need we for the present suppose ver. 50 to have any real meaning inconsistent with its apparent meaning, viz. that Caleb is the name of a grandson (son of Hut) as well as of the grandfather. There remain the occasions of the occurring of the word in vers. 9, 18, 42, 49.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The first appearance, then, of the name in this chapter (ver. 9) exhibits it in a form different from that in which it appears the other times in this chapter or elsewhere, viz. as כְלוּבַי, instead of כָלֵב (or once as a patronymic, 1 Samuel 25:3, כּלִֹבִּי). The Vulgate follows the Hebrew, but the Septuagint has at once substituted Caleb. The Syriac Version has Salchi, and the Arabic Sachli, both of them, no doubt, mere transcribers' errors through the mistake of a letter. This form \"Chelubai\" is, then, an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, and no different account has yet been given of the name appearing thus on this one occasion. It may be described, with Lange ('Comm. Old Testament,' in loc.), as \"adjectivus gentilis\" to כְלוּב, which word, however, occur where it will, is never treated as a synonym with Caleb except by the Septuagint, and then but once (1 Chronicles 4:11), making Lange's further claim of three forms for the name of Caleb wrong. The name might be translated the \"Cheluban\" or \"Chelubite.\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. The Caleb called here first \"Chelubai,\" again\" Caleb the son of Hezron,\" and now \"Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel,\" some, and Keil among them, have endeavoured to identify with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. This latter is a well-known figure in history. He, together with Joshua, was among those who, departing from Egypt, were pursued of Pharaoh, and of all the host these two alone lived to enter into the promised land. This is enough to give him distinction and a prominent place before the eye. To this Caleb unmistakable reference is made in twenty-eight passages, in sixteen of which he is called \"son of Jephunneh,\" and in three of those sixteen \"son of Jephunneh the Kenazite.\" Now, he tells us himself (Joshua 14:7) that he was forty years old in the seceded year after the Exodus. But it seems (Genesis 46:12, 26) that Hezron, grandson of Judah, and the father of the Caleb of this chapter, was, however young, one of those who went down into Egypt with Jacob, at a date, according to any chronology, which must render it impossible for any son of his to have been alive and only forty years of age at the time of the Exodus. This being so, either the statement already referred to, found at the close of ver. 49, that \"the daughter of Caleb was Achsa,\" must be an interpolation from some ignorant transcriber's marginal annotation, or, unlikely as it is, Caleb the son of Hezron and Caleb the son of Jephunneh both named a daughter Achsa. It is, moreover, likely enough that the frequent describing of Caleb the son of Jephuuneli in this style was occasioned by the desire to distinguish him from some other Caleb, not a contemporary, indeed, but already well known m a generation preceding but not too remote. Other considerations decidedly concur with this view: e.g. Ram is brother of Caleb the son of Hezron; he has a grandson, Nahshon, of great distinction,\" a prince of the children of Judah,\" whose sister Aaron married; he was the elect of the Judah tribe to assist Moses and Aaron in the first numbering of the people (Numbers 1:7). Great prominence is given to him (Numbers 7:12; Numbers 10:14). He was clearly (Matthew 1:4; Luke 3:32) fifth in descent from Judah, in perfect agreement with the table of this chapter. Now, it was this grandson of the elder brother of Caleb who was contemporary with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. Similarly, the Bezaleel of this chapter (ver. 20), a great-grandson of Caleb the Hezronite, is spoken of (Exodus 31:1; Exodus 35:30) at the same date exactly at which Caleb the son of Jephunneh says he was still but forty years of age lNEWLINENEWLINE3. The identity of the Caleb of ver. 50, son of Hut, with Caleb the son of Jephuuneh is supposed by some, but is not clear. It appears to be asserted, without explanation, in the arts. \"Caleb\" and \"Ephrath,\" signed A. C. H., Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' though in the second part of the latter article it is alluded to as only possible. On the other hand, it may rather be that Caleb the son of Jephunneh, instead of being identical with this Caleb the son of Hur, is so called in order to distinguish him from this latter as a contemporary. Again, it has been happily conjectured ('Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.) that just as ver. 33 closes the table of Jerahmeel with \"These were the sons of Jerahmeel,\" so ver. 49 should close the table of Caleb (ver. 42) with the words, These were the Boris of Caleb. With a slight alteration, ver. 50 would then begin The sons of Hur, etc. This is, however, only conjecture. Ver. 42, then, must be considered to give us another family of Caleb, i.e. a family by another wife, of name not given, just possibly the Jerioth unaccounted for in ver. 18. The first statement lauds us in perplexity. Mesha (מֵישַׁע) is the firstborn (i.e. by the wife or woman in question), and the founder of Ziph. And amid some omission or corruption of text, we are then confronted with the words, and the sons of Marsehah (מָרֵישָׁה) the father (or again, perhaps founder) of Hebron. The reading of the Septuagint gives Mareshah in both of these passages, and may come from a Hebrew text that we have not. The substitution could, however, scarcely be accounted for as a mere clerical error, considering both the omission of a resh and the replacing of an he with an ayin. The sentence refuses at present any treatment except the unsatisfactory one of pure conjecture. But employing this, it may be noted that the omitting of the words, \"the sons of,\" before Mareshah would most help to clear the verse of confusion. In this and following verses, Ziph, Hebron, Tappuah, Jorkoam, and Beth-zur, are all names of places certainly, whether or not they are all of persons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Hebron; Korah, and Tappuah, and Rekem, and Shema.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shema begat Raham, the father of Jorkoam: and Rekem begat Shammai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the son of Shammai was Maon: and Maon was the father of Bethzur.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ephah, Caleb's concubine, bare Haran, and Moza, and Gazez: and Haran begat Gazez.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 46-49 give the names (the first of which appears as that of a man also, next verse and 1 Chronicles 1:33) of two additional concubines of Caleb, and of their descendants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Jahdai; Regem, and Jotham, and Geshan, and Pelet, and Ephah, and Shaaph.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47 offers us another name, Jahdai, not to be accounted for with any certainty. It is not linked to the context, and nothing is known of the six sons assigned to the person owning it. That Gazez occurs twice in the previous verse is remarkable, and suggestive, possibly, of mistake. The Septuagint omits altogether the clause in which it is found the second time. Houbigant translates, \"Porro Haran genuit Jahdai,\" and so summarily removes the difficulty from his way (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). Hiller ('Onomasticon,' S.) would make it the same name as Moza, but without any pretence of argument. A more reasonable suggestion than this might be that Jahdai is the name of yet another concubine of Caleb (Lange, 'O.T. Comm.,' in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMaachah, Caleb's concubine, bare Sheber, and Tirhanah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe bare also Shaaph the father of Madmannah, Sheva the father of Machbenah, and the father of Gibea: and the daughter of Caleb was Achsah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Machbenah is an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον (for Madmannah and Gibea, Joshua 15:31, 57).

This rendering is got at by altering \"the son of Hut\" into \"the sons of Hur,\" which seems to have been the reading of the Septuagint manuscripts, and which, at all events, their rendering has.

Shobal, prince of Kirjath-jearim (city of woods; Joshua 9:17; Joshua 18:15; Joshua 15:9, 60; cf. 18:14), on the border-hind of Judah and Benjamin, and about ten miles from Jerusalem on the road to Emmaus (Nicopolis). It is to be identified, almost with certainty, with the modern Kuriet-el-Enab. Other references of exceeding interest are 1 Samuel 6:21; 1 Samuel 7:2; 2 Samuel 6:5; Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29; 1 Chronicles 13:6; 2 Chronicles 1:4; Jeremiah 26:20; Psalm 132:6. This Shobal (ver. 52) had two sons, Haroeh, i.e. Reaiah (1 Chronicles 4:5), and the progenitor, whatever his name, of half of the people called Manahethites (Authorized Version) - a form probably suggested by the Masoretic pointing of ver. 54 - or Chatsi-hammenon-choth (Hebrew text), which Gesenius treats as a proper name, and which means \"the midst of quiet places\" (Psalm 23:2), from which comes the patronymic of the next verse but one (Barrington, 'Genealogies,' 1:213). From the Kirjath-jearim family were derived (ver. 53), the Ithrites, Puhites, Shumathites, and Mishraites, of none of whom, except probably the Ithrites (2 Samuel 23:38; 1 Chronicles 11:40), do we find other mention; and from the Mishraites again were derived two offshoots, the Zareathites and Eshtaulites, the towns of both of whom are with great probability to be tracked (Joshua 15:33; Joshua 19:41; Judges 13:25; Judges 18:2). They were situated in that part of Judah called the \"low\" country, or the Shefelah, stretching from Joppa to Gaza on the Mediterranean.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Salma, prince of Bethlehem. The so-called \"sons\" here attributed to him, six in number, including Bethlehem, evidently betoken families rather than the names of individuals. The town Netophah (Ezra 2:21; Nehemiah 7:26) gave the gentile noun Netophathites (2 Samuel 23:28; Jeremiah 40:8). Ataroth, the house of Joab (i.e. \"crowns\" of the house of Joab), is not mentioned elsewhere; but the reason of its being distinguished thus may be due to the fact that there was another Ataroth of Gad (Numbers 32:3, 34), and yet another of Ephraim (Joshua 14:5; Joshua 18:13). The Zorites (צִרְעִי) Gesenius thinks to be another gentile form from צָרְעה with צִרְעָתִי, but of them we do not read elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSalma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of Bethgader.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles2:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the families of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55 should not have been separated from the last word of the previous verse. The families of the scribes is linked on by the conjunction and (which has coupled the former sons of Salma also two and two) with \"the Zorites.\" This sixth set of descendants from Salma is exhibited to us in the shape of a trio of scribe families, the heads of which will have been, presumably, Tira, Shimea, and Suchah. They are said to have dwelt at Jabez, a place not ascertained; and scarcely to be put into connection with the Jabez of 1 Chronicles 4:9. The Vulgate has translated the names of these three families: Canentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes;\" and Bertheau advocates the interpretation. These families, it appears, were not purely of Judah; but very interesting it is that, though of the people whose land and possessions were to yield to the descendants of Abraham (Genesis 15:18-21), yet friendship and intermarriage had found them apparently a lasting place in Judah (Judges 1:16), while Saul was careful to urge them to save themselves when he was about to smite the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:6). Though nothing is known of the link of connection given here in the name Hemath (of which the Vulgate gives the rendering, Qui venerunt de celose patris), yet the house of the Rechabites is well known (2 Kings 10:15, 23; Jeremiah 35:2, 5, 18; and cf. 2 Samuel 4:2, particularly 3).NEWLINENEWLINE3. In ver. 51 Hareph (חָרֵפ) only here; though הָריִפ, found Nehemiah 7:24; Nehemiah 10:20; Ezra 2:18, may possibly he connected with it. There is nothing further said of any people derived from him except that he was father of Beth-gader. The identification of this place is not certain. Gesenius thinks it perhaps the same with Gederah (Joshua 15:36), but it is more probably the Gedor of same chapter (fifty-eighth verse), on the road between Hebron and Jerusalem.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - The whole of this chapter is occupied with the descendants of David: the first nine verses of it with his own sons, classified according to the place of their birth, Hebron or Jerusalem; the remaining verses with the line of kings of his house to Jeconiah and Zedekiah (ver. 16), the grandsons of Zerubbabel (ver. 21), and descendants of Shechaniah (ver. 24). To the seven years and six months (2 Samuel 2:11) of David's reign at Hebron six sons belong, each of a different mother. To the thirty and throe years (2 Samuel 5:5; 1 Kings 2:11) of his reign at Jerusalem belong other thirteen sons, viz. four of one mother, Bethshua, and nine of other mothers, whose names are not given. The list of the six Hebron sons, with their mothers, is nearly identical with that of 2 Samuel 3:2-5, although the differences, slight as they are, would of the two indicate our list here rather as not copied than copied thence. The only noticeable difference, however, is in the name of the second son, announced here as Daniel, instead of Chileab, while the Septuagint has Δαλουία. This, together with the circumstance that one word would, as regards the Hebrew characters, comparatively easily convert into the other. renders it probable that it is merely a corrupt text or text obscure at this point which has occasioned the difference. The meaning of the name Daniel, put side by side with what we read in 1 Samuel 24:15, 25:39, suggests strongly that it is the right name of the two. It was a name likely to be given by David to his first child by Abigail. Additional suspicion is thrown on the name Chileab through the three last letters of it, \"leab,\" constituting also the three first of the very next word,\" of Abigail\" (לַאְביִנַיִל) which looks very much like the over-haste of the pen uncorrected. It is remarkable that the Syriac and Arabic versions translate \"Caleb,\" both here and in the parallel passage. For the sons born in Jerusalem we have all three parallel lists at command, and the variations are rather greater. The other two lists are in 2 Samuel 5:14-16; 1 Chronicles 14:4-7. The first of these omits Eliphelet and Nogah (possibly they died young or without issue), and the latter calls Eliphelet Elpalet (אֶלְפֶלֶט). Again, Shimeah and Elishama in our passage must yield, overruled by the consent of the other two, to Shammuah and Elishua. Again, it is to be noticed that the name Eliada (God (אֶל) knoweth), on occasion of its latest occurence (1 Chronicles 14:7), appears as Beeliada (the Lord (בַעַל) knoweth), preserving therein probably its earlier form, viz. that used before a settled bad sense had come to be attached to the word Baal (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe third, Absalom the son of Maachah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur: the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fifth, Shephatiah of Abital: the sixth, Ithream by Eglah his wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese six were born unto him in Hebron; and there he reigned seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In this verse we have the form Bathshua for the familiar name Bathsheba, i.e. בַת־שׁוַּע for בַת־שֶׁבַע, in which latter word שֶׁבַע is a shorter form of שְׁבוּעָה. In the same verse we have עַמִּיאֵל here for ךאלִעִָם in 2 Samuel 11:3. The former name occurs often, e.g. Numbers 13:12; 2 Samuel 9:4, 5; 2 Samuel 17:27; 1 Chronicles 26:5. The component parts of both words are the same, but their order is different - the meaning of the one perhaps \"the people of God;\" of the other, \"the God of the people.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIbhar also, and Elishama, and Eliphelet,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet, nine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This verse plainly adds concubines, perhaps the ten spoken of in 2 Samuel 15:16, to the number of the mothers of the foregoing sons. The mention of only one daughter of David, viz. Tamar, follows the manifest ordinary rule, that daughters are not recorded at all, except for one of two reasons - either that through a daughter the line was saved, or that the daughter had from some special reason made a place for herself in history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-16. - The line of royal descent from David, is now rapidly carried down in these verses - first, as far as good King Josiah, sixteen generations in all (omitting, quite consistently, Athalia, who reigned by her own usurpation for six years on the death of her son Azariah); and then, by four successions (viz. two brothers, sons of Josiah, and a grandson and great-grandson of Josiah), to the Captivity. Verse 10. - Though the Authorized Version has Abia the Hebrew word is אֲבִיָּה both here and in 2 Chronicles 13:1, 23 (or Authorized Version, 14:1), in both of which passages, as also elsewhere, our Authorized Version has Abijah. Another form is Abijam (אֲבִיָּם), as in 1 Kings 14:31 and elsewhere. A corrupt form (אֲבִיָּחוּ) is found in 2 Chronicles 13:20.

We have the name as Azariah in Matthew 1:8, 9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAhaz his son, Hezekiah his son, Manasseh his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmon his son, Josiah his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The first thing to be observed in this verse is that, though it lays stress on the mention of the name of Josiah's firstborn of four sons as Johanan, this is the only mention of him. Some, however, have taken the Jehoahaz of 2 Kings 23:30 for him. Next, that Jehoiakim was not the original name of the next brother, but a name slightly altered by Pharaoh-Necho from Eliakim (2 Kings 23:34). If the dates of 2 Kings 23:31, 34, 36, be correct, there is no doubt that, though Jehoiakim, i.e. Eliakim, reigned after Jehoahaz, yet he was the elder, and is in his right place in the present passage. Next, that Shallum (Jeremiah 20:11) is another name of the Jehoa-haz of 2 Kings 23:30, 31, 34, and several other places. It is possible that he finds the last place amid the four brothers of this verse because of his probable usurpation of the throne, in violation of the right of his elder brother, Jehoiakim, and the early fall he met with in consequence. Lastly, that the fourth brother, Zedekiah, whose name (2 Kings 24:17) was originally Mattha-niah, was put on the throne by the King of Babylon, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem (2 Kings 24:18) after that his nephew Jehoiachin (who could have no son old enough to succeed) was (2 Kings 24:12, 15, 17) carried captive to Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Of the above four brothers, sons of Josiah, the second, Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, had a son called Jeconiah, or Jehoiachin - essentially the same word. He was eighteen years of age when he succeeded his father (2 Kings 24:8). A touching glimpse is given of him in Jeremiah 52:31. His name is shortened to Coniah in Jeremiah 22:24 and Jeremiah 37:1, though elsewhere in the same prophet, Jeconiah, and in one place (Jeremiah 52:31), Jehoiachin. The name of Zedekiah occasions difficulty in this verse. In the first instance, following the examples of vers. 10-14, we should presume that this Zedekiah is set forth as a son of Jeconiah, and as it is not said that he reigned after Jeconiah (for it was undoubtedly Jeconiah's uncle Zedekiah who reigned after him), we need only have read it as a statement of one of his sons. Against this, however, there are two tolerably decisive considerations; for, first, the verse opens confessedly by offering us sons of Jehoiakim, and these two, Jeconiah and Zedekiah, will fulfil the promise of that plural; and again, the seventeenth verse enters upon the formal enumeration of sons to Jeconiah. The question, therefore, returns - Who was this Zedekiah, son of Jehoiakim? Some consider him identical with the Zedekiah of the previous verse, and that \"his son\" means here \"his successor.\" This undoes fewer difficulties than it makes. If the text be not corrupt, the likeliest solution is to suppose that this Zedekiah of ver. 16 is an otherwise unknown brother of Jeconiah, and son of Jehoiakim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-24. - These verses contain a line of descent brought down to a point not merely posterior to the Exile, but possibly reaching to the time of Alexander. This line, however, through Solomon is lost so soon as the first name, that of Assir, is passed; Salathiel (Authorized Version)or Shealtiel, being descended from David, not through Solomon, but through Nathan, whole brother to Solomon. This Assir is not known from any parallel passage; and Luther, Starke, Bertheau, and others, followed by Zoekler (in Lange, 'Comm. O.T.') translate the name as captive, applying it to Jeconiah. Not all their reasons, however, for this, outweigh one which must be pronounced against it, viz. the absence of the article. The Septuagint and Vulgate versions agree with our own. The greater probability might be that Assir derived his name from being born after Jeconiah was in captivity, and such passages as Isaiah 39:7, Jeremiah 22:30, may throw some light upon the extinction of Solomon's line here, and the transfer of the succession (comp. Numbers 27:11, and see interesting note on the present place in 'Speaker's Commentary'). Salathiel is the Authorized Version incorrect rendering of the Hebrew Shealtiel. In Matthew 1:12 it is said, \"And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;\" and in Luke 3:27, \"Salathiel, which was the son of Neri.\" Now, Neri was in the direct line of Nathan. There seems only one way of reconciling these statements - and the method removes similar difficulties in other places also - viz, to distinguish between the descent natural and the descent royal, and then acknowledge that the former was swallowed up, where necessary, of the latter. One as decisive instance of this kind as that before us is most useful to rule other cases. (For an important allusion to the house and family of Nathan's descendants, as well known at the time, see Zechariah 12:12 - a passage probably dating a few years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.),NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMalchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Of the name Malchiram and five following, it must be left still doubtful whose sons they were - whether of Jeconiah (comp. again 2 Kings 24:12, 15; Jeremiah 22:30) or of Neri as possibly brothers of Salathiel, or of neither of these. The first of these suppositions seems almost untenable, the second seems unlikely enough, and the exceeding prevalence of a corrupt text would strongly favour the third supposition. At the same time, it may be observed that ver. 19 proves that the names must belong to the royal succession, and indicates that, whoever Salathiel was in such aspect, that Pedaiah was, who becomes father of Zerubbabel. The verses that follow are thought by Eichhorn, Dahler, Keil, and some others to be an interpolation of later date, chiefly on account of the point to which the genealogy is brought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Pedaiah is now given as the father of Zeraubabel and Shimei. Of the latter of these nothing else is known, unless Lord Hervey's theory below be correct. The former is a great name - its derivation perhaps doubtful. Strictly it signifies \"scattered to Babylon,\" but (Gesenius, 'Lexicon') if the initial part of the word be strengthened into זְרוַּע, the signification might be \"born in Babylon.\" We have in this name another instance of the treatment just commented on with regard to the name Salathiel in Luke 3:28. Zerubbabel is elsewhere invariably described as son of Salathiel, or Shealtiel; but as the genealogy of St. Luke gives the natural descent of Salathiel as from Neri, so does our genealogy in this one place give us the natural descent of Zerubbabel as from Pedaiah, one of Salathiel's brothers; while all other passages (e.g. Ezra 3:8; Haggai 1:12; Matthew 1:12; Luke 3:27)give us that for which the genealogical table is chiefly designed, viz. the matter of succession, according to which Zerubbabel would be-shown as son, i.e. link of succession, following on Shealtiel. Verse 19. - Meshullam. Though this name recurs, and very frequently, in Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, yet the person here denoted by it - son of Zerubbabel - is found here only. Hananiah, 1.q. Joanna of Luke 3:27, the names being the same, but with the component parts transposed, as in instances already given above. In the Gospel, Hananiah appears as grandson of Zorobabel, Rhesa intervening. Shelomith. This person is mentioned here only. The word, though evidently a feminine form, is found for the name of a man, chief of the Izarhites (1 Chronicles 23:18), but very possibly by a mere clerical error, as the true form is given in the very next chapter (1 Chronicles 24:22) for the same character, viz. שְׁלמֹות.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushabhesed, five.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The five additional names of this verse must presumably stand apart from the two sons and one daughter of the preceding verse, for some reason. What that reason may be is not known. Perhaps the most natural supposition is that their mother was not the same. The meaning of some of the names, as especially of the last, Jushab-hesed, i.e. \"Loving-kindness is returned,\" has led Bertheau and others to the conjecture that they may be separated as children born to Zerubbabel, one of the leaders of the return from captivity, after that return. This seems plausible, except for the consideration that, the more plausible it is, the more we might expect the explanation itself to have been notified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah, and Jesaiah: the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shechaniah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The Hebrew text, followed by the Vulgate, not followed by the Septuagint, reads here וּבֶןאּהֲנַנְיָח. Yet some manuscripts have the plural \"sons,\" from which comes our Authorized Version. The indication is important. It is doubly interesting, as the only indication in our Hebrew text that tends to give confirmation to the very noteworthy differences of the Septuagint Version. For although this last, apparently somewhat perversely, begins its version with \"sons,\" which plural does not so well suit its sequel, instead of the \"son\" of our Hebrew text, which would suit it, yet it proceeds with a translation which must have been obtained from another text, such text again suiting properly the singular - \"son\" - of our Hebrew. The form of its translation is analogous to that marked in the words of vers. 10-14. \"The sons [sic son] of Ananiah, Pelatiah, and Jesaiah his son, Rephaiah his son, Arnan his son, Obadiah his son, Shechaniah his son,\" making six (presumably) consecutive generations. This, therefore, is the reading which (if correct) might carry down the genealogy to the times of Alexander the Great, and indeed to a time a quarter of a century later. And in doing so, it would certify this entry as of later date than probably any other of the canon! If we reject this position and reading, we have to get over the term, repeated several times, the sons of. To do this, Bertheau suggests that the intention of our passage was, from the name Rephaiah inclusive, not to mention the individual four brothers' names, but to mention them as four distinguished families among the posterity of David - an attempt at explanation certainly not satisfactory. The conclusion of the matter is, that in this twenty-first verse we have difficulties in either alternative, not satisfactorily explained. Either we have the names in all of six brothers, being \"sons of Hananiah\" - the last four of whom are styled, not by their individual names, but as heads of families; or we have six lineal descendants from Hananiah. If this last supposition were correct, calculate a royal succession at the lowest average (say something under twenty years), and the genealogy, including what follows in the remaining verses of the chapter, will bring us, as above, to a date that covers the whole life of Alexander the Great.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Shechaniah; Shemaiah: and the sons of Shemaiah; Hattush, and Igeal, and Bariah, and Neariah, and Shaphat, six.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In the obscurity that obtains on the subject, there is one somewhat bright star of light in a succeeding name, Hattush, to which this verse leads us. This verse purports to help on the line of genealogy by a contribution of two descents, the effective names being Shemaiah and Neariah, the line coming to its close by aid of two other effective names, Elioenai and (say) Hodaiah, contained in the last two verses of the chapter. Although one manifest error in ver. 22 (involved in the number \"six\" when only five sons have been read) betokens the insecurity of the text, yet the summary measures of the ingenious Lord A. C. Hervey (see his valuable work on the 'Genealogies of our Lord Jesus Christ,' pp. 103, 307, 322; and articles in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:666, 667) can scarcely be warranted, when he wishes first to omit altogether the words and the sons of Shecaniah; Shemaiah; and next, to regard Shemaiah as Shimei, the brother of Zerub-babel, and, as matter of course, those who followed as the descendants of this brother of Zerubbabel, instead of Zerubbabel himself. Now, a passage in the Book of Ezra helps us much here. Ezra mentions, as one of those of the \"sons of David\" who went up with him from Babylon to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:2, 3), Hattush, \"of the sons of Shechaniah.\" There is not only nothing to prevent this Hattush being the same as the elder brother of Neariah, who comes fourth in succession from Zerubbabel (i.e. on the hypothesis that the six names of ver. 21 are brothers, not a line of descents), but at the above-mentioned average of twenty years the dates will admirably synchronize - the last date of Zerubbabel being about B.C. 520, and that of Neariah B.C. 440; while the date of Ezra's journey was B.C. 458 (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' 3:186, 187). This coincidence of names and dates must not be regarded as con-elusive; but, pending further discovery, it strongly disfavours the idea of the names of ver. 21 constituting a succession, and it keeps well in check the rate of succeeding generations, bringing the last member of the succession to a date that may be harmonized with others which have for the most part held their ground. That in ver. 22 only five names are given for what are summed up as \"six,\" must lead to the supposition that one has dropped out; and since no known manuscript of the Hebrew text, nor the Septuagint or Vulgate versions supplies us with the missing name, the Syriac and Arabic versions, which supply the name Azariah between Neariah and Shaphat, must be viewed with some suspicion. Igeal is, in the Hebrew, a word (יגִךאל) identical with the Igal of Numbers 13:7; 2 Samuel 23:36 - Septuagint in the latter passages Ἰλαὰλ or Ἰγάλ, but in the present place Ἰωὴλ. Of the other persons in this verse little or nothing else is known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Neariah; Elioenai, and Hezekiah, and Azrikam, three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - None of the names in this or the following verse assists as yet in throwing any light upon the questions that arise in this fragment of genealogy. Lord A. C. Hervey would identify Hodaiah (ver. 24) with Abiud (Matthew 1:13) and with Juda (Luke 3:26), and quotes, for very just confirmation of the possibility so far as the mere names are concerned, Ezra 3:9; Nehemiah 11:9; compared with Ezra 2:40; 1 Chronicles 9:7.

The first verses follow in the direction already indicated in ch. 2, near the end of which we were left with Shobal and Haroeh, probably the same with Reaiah (the same name as Reaia, 1 Chronicles 5:5, though not the same person). Verses 1, 2. - The Carrot of ver. 1 is considered to lie doubtful between the Carmi of 1 Chronicles 2:7 or the Chelubai of 1 Chronicles 2:9, in which last alternation the five names of this verse would repeat the line of descent with which chrii, had made us familiar. Even then the object or advantage of repeating the first four of these, so far as what follows is concerned, is not evident. We keep near the close of ch. 2. also in respect of another allusion to the Zorathites (1 Chronicles 2:53), whose families were replenished by the two sons of Jahath, Ahumai and Lahad, of all of whom this is all we know.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Reaiah the son of Shobal begat Jahath; and Jahath begat Ahumai, and Lahad.

It was near Tekoah (ver. 5, and 1 Chronicles 2:24) and Bethlehem (next verse). The hiatus in the first clause may possibly be supplied by \"the families of\" from the last verse, or, more fitly, by \"the sons of,\" inasmuch as some manuscripts have it so. The Septuagint, however, and Vulgate displace \"the father of\" (i.e. chief of), replacing it by \"the sons of.\" The Syriac Version leaves out any notice of the sister, Hazelelponi, and gives the former part of the verse thus: \"These are Amina-dab's sons, Ahizareel, Nesma, and Dibas, Pheguel and Husia; These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratha, who was the father,\" etc. With this the Arabic Version is partly in agreement, but closes the verse with the words, \"These are the sons of Hur, son of Ephratha, the father of whom [plural] was of Bethlehem.\" The Chronicle Targum translates, \"the rabbis dwelling at Etam.\" This variety indicates the difficulty felt by each in turn. The verse, however, purports to give the names of three brothers and one sister (Hazelel-poni, i.e. the shadow looking at me, Gesenius) connected with Etam, as in the following verse Penuel with Gedor (1 Chronicles 2:51) and Ezer with Hushah (1 Chronicles 11:29; 2 Samuel 23:27). Of no one of these, in all six other descendants of Hur, additional to those found at the close of ch. 2, is anything distinct known. It is to be noted that Hut himself is here called father of Bethlehem, while (1 Chronicles 2:51) his son Salma is so called.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah.

Ashur, the posthumous son of Hezron by Abia, now again, as there, styled father, or chief, of Tekoa, a town, as above, near Etam, Bethlehem, etc. He is brought forward that the names of his two wives, with four children to the latter of them and three to the former, may be given. The Roman Septuagint unaccountably gives different names to the mothers, and reverses the groups of the four and three children. Nothing else is known of these nine persons. The last two names of the group of four more resemble in form the name of the head of a family than an individual name; and for Jezoar, the middle name of the group of three, the easy Keri of \"and Zohar\" is followed by the Septuagint, and was followed by our 1611 Authorized Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Naarah bare him Ahuzam, and Hepher, and Temeni, and Haahashtari.

The introduction of them, abrupt as it is, is, however, paralleled by many others ira-mediately following in this chapter, as well as elsewhere. Nothing has yet been produced in elucidation of any one of the persons designated by these names, or of their relation to the context.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This is not less true of the name of vers. 9, 10, which, however, has made its own mark amid the whole scene. The episode of these two verses, offering itself amid what should seem, superficially, a dry mass of dead names, is welcome and grateful as the oasis of the desert, and it warns us that life lies hidden at our every footfall on this ground, spread over though it is with monument and inscription, and hollow, as we thought, with the deadest of the dead. But the glimpse of old real life given us in this brief fragment of a biography is refreshing and is very suggestive. It seems an insufficient and unnatural method of accounting for the suddenness of the appearance of this episode to suppose ('Speaker's Commentary,' in lee.) that the name of Jahez was well known, from any cause, to those for whom Chronicles may be supposed to have been primarily intended. We prefer by far one account of it, viz. that the work in our hands is not in its original complete state; or, variously put, that it is in its uncompleted original state. No root corresponding to the characters of this name in present order is known; it is possible that some euphonic reason makes the name יַעְבּצ out of the real word (future Kal) יַעִצֵב, i.e. he causes pains. We cannot suppose there would be any \"play\" appreciable on a transposition of alphabetical characters for mere play's sake. The resemblance that almost each part of this brief and abruptly introduced narration bears to incidents recorded in Genesis (Genesis 34:19; Genesis 33:20; Genesis 4:25; Genesis 29:32; Genesis 28:20) and Exodus speaks for itself, and strongly countenances the supposition that it is a genuine deposit of the genuinely olden history of Judah. The mother's reason for the naming of the child; the language and matter and form (Genesis 17:18-20; Exodus 32:32) of the prayer of the child, when presumably he was no longer a child; and the discriminating use of the words Elohim (ver. 10) of Israel, as comps, red with the name Jehovah (1 Chronicles 2:3; 5:41), generally found here, - all help to produce this impression, although some of these particulars would carry little conviction by themselves; e.g. a mother's reasons for assigning the name of her child long outlived the earlier times alone. Upon the whole, and regarding the passage in its present place, we may say that it must be very much misplaced, or else must be understood to connect Jabez with some branch of the family of Coz. There is the more room to assume this in the vagueness of the last preceding clause, \"The families of Aharhel the son of Harum.\" The origin of the theories of some of the older Jewish writers, to the effect that Jabez was a doctor in the law, with a school of scribes around him, is probably to be found in the desire to find a connection between his proper name, Jabez, and the place so named (1 Chronicles 2:55), and where, as we are told, \"families of scribes dwelt,\" belonging to the Kenites. That these were connected with Bethlehem, through Salma, and that Jabez of our present passage was also of a family connected with Bethlehem, is worthy of notice, but is not enough by a long way to countenance the thought, in spite of Targum and Talmud (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' sub vet.). The Targum, as well here as in 1 Chronicles 2:55, identifies Jabez with Othniel \"son of Keuaz\" (Joshua 15:17; Judges 1:13; Judges 3:9), or more probably \"the Kenizzite\" merely; but there is nothing to sustain such an identification. The description, he was more honourable than his brethren, finds a close parallel, so far as the word honourable goes, in Genesis 34:19; although the honourableness of Shechem, the person there in question, does not come out to anything like the same advantage with that of Jabez, nor at all in the same direction. The word, however, is precisely the same, is often used elsewhere, and uniformly in a good sense, although the range of its application is wide. The essential idea of the root appears to be \"weight.\" The phrase may therefore be supposed to answer to our expressive phrase, a \"man of weight \" - the weight being sometimes due chiefly to character, at other times to position and wealth in the first place, though not entirely divorced from considerations of character. We may safely judge, from what follows, that the intention in our present passage is to describe Jabez as a man of more ability and nobility than his brethren. It can scarcely be doubted that the meaning that lies on the surface is the correct interpretation, when it is said that his mother named him Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. The sorrow refers to unusual pains of travail, not to any attendant circumstances of domestic trial, as e.g. that the time of his birth was coincident with her own widowhood, as happened to the wife of Phinehas, when she named her offspring \"Ichabod\" (1 Samuel 4:19-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When Jabez grew to manhood he has learnt to estimate rightly the value of God's blessing. He invokes it, and depends upon it. His language implies the confidence that he had in the reality of providential blessing. For the expression, enlarge my coast, see Deuteronomy 12:20; Deuteronomy 19:8; and though we know nothing as matter of fact about the occasion of this prayer, we may assume that it was one when not selfishness and greed of larger territory, but just opportunity, had awakened a strong desire for enlargement of borders. It may have been a legitimate occasion of recovering his own, lost or wrongfully taken from him or his predecessors before him, or of expelling successfully from their hold upon it a portion of the original inhabitants of the promised land of God's people. That thine hand might be with me. Many are the beautiful parallels to be culled from the Word of God for this expression, as e.g. Ezra 7:9; Psalm 80:17; Psalm 119:173; Psalm 139:5, 10; Isaiah 42:6. And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! This, the last entreaty of the prayer, is the largest and most far-seeing. Warned by his own name, forewarned by his mother's emphasizing of her own pains in him, he thus concludes. Having begun in the evil of pain and excessive sorrow, he prays that he and his career may not so determine and end. He does not necessarily pray to be preserved from all suffering, but from such baneful touch of evil itself, its principle, its tyrannous, merciless hold, as might bring him to real and irreparable grief. Thus closes the whole prayer, each succeeding clause of which has been under the rule of the initial \"if,\" translated with us, Oh that. This well-known Hebrew form of prayer supposes a solemn engagement, and that the answered prayer shall meet with the fulfilment of a vowed promise on the part of the suppliant, according to the pattern of Genesis 28:20. In the absence of that engagement here, we may notice, with Keil, the greater grace of the passage, in that it closes with the statement of the readiness to hear, and the abounding readiness to answer, on the part of Divine beneficence: And God granted him that which he requested. Evidently the thing that he asked pleased the Lord (1 Kings 3:10, 12); although it was in this case some form of riches, and long life for self, and the life of his enemies, that he asked, and was not altogether and in so many words \"a wise and understanding heart.\" Perhaps, also there was in the way of asking, and in the exact occasion, unknown to us, something which quite justified the matter of the prayer, and which thus pleased the Lord. The remarkable and arresting episode could not have closed in more welcome or impressive way than when it is thus briefly but conclusively said, \"And God granted him that which he requested.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - Of the whole of the group of names, contained in these two verses, it must be said that we are in the dark. The suggestion of Grove, in his art. \"Ir-enahash\" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), is worth notice, that possibly the versos may be a reminiscence of some Canaanitish graft on Judah - the Shuah (שׁוּחָה) of ver. 11 pointing to the Shua (שׁוַּע)of 1 Chronicles 2:3; Genesis 38:2. Beth-rapha (the house of the giant) looks more like the name of a place than of a person, though the text needs a person, and such may be covered possibly by this name, though it be of a place. Ir-nahash (the city of the serpent). Jerome, in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae in Parah,' asserts or repeats the assertion of some one else that this is no other place than Bethlehem; taking Nahash as a synonym with Jesse. Unlikely as this is, no place of the name is known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Eshton begat Bethrapha, and Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Irnahash.

From comparison of the many passages in Numbers, Joshua, and Judges, which contain references to Othniel and Caleb (son of Jephunneh), the stronger conclusion to which we are led is that Othniel was younger brother of Caleb (probably not by both the same parents) and Kenaz a forefather, of course not literally father. The conclusion is not arrived at without difficulty, or with any real certainty. In the present instance, e.g., why should Othniel, if the younger brother and so expressly and repeatedly mentioned, be taken first? For the possible Kenaz of this passage, we might then refer to 1 Chronicles 1:53; Genesis 36:42. Hathath. The marginal reading, which joins Meonothai at once to Hathath, and then supplies \"who\" before \"begat Ophrah,\" is decidedly to be adopted. Joab son of Seraiah is not to be assumed to be one with Joab son of Zeruiah. The valley of the Charashim (see also Nehemiah 11:35), i.e. smiths, or craftsmen, lay east of Jaffa, and behind the plain of Sharon; and is said by Jerome, in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae in Paral.,' to have been, according to tradition, named so because the architects of the temple came thence. Iru. Perhaps the real name is It, and the final vau rather an initial for the next name. Elah. Probably another name is wanting after this, which the vau will then join to Kenaz; otherwise, as vau will not translate \"even,\" the following name will become, as in the margin, Uknaz. The wanting name might be the Jehalaleel of the next verse. This last name is in the Hebrew identical with the Jehalelel of our Authorized Version (2 Chronicles 29:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; Iru, Elah, and Naam: and the sons of Elah, even Kenaz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Jehaleleel; Ziph, and Ziphah, Tiria, and Asareel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Of none of the characters of this verse can anything be said beyond what appears here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bare Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - From the tangle of these verses it is hopeless to attempt any certain conclusions. The fact of the antithesis of the Jewess wife (by some assigned as wife to Ezra), and the presumably Egyptian wife mentioned in the latter verse, is perhaps just enough in the general obscurity to suggest that Mered, the asserted husband of the latter, is to be understood as the husband of the former also But to compass so much as this, we have to overlook omission in ver. 17 and inversion in ver. 18. There is a tone about the verses, due to names they contain, that might suggest to us the times of Egypt and Moses, and traditions in keeping do not fail to come to view in Jerome ('Quaestiones,' etc.; see also art. \"Meted,\" Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The four places, Eshtemoa, Gedor, Socho, Zanoah, may all with tolerable confidence be identified in Joshua 15:48-58, as of the number of the cities \"in the mountains,\" though Zanoah and Socho are found also \"in the valley\" (Joshua 15:33-36). In this passage the Septuagint gives us no help, but betrays its own perplexity, offering to make Jether the father of Miriam; while the Syriac and Arabic versions simply skip the verses as incoherent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his wife Jehudijah bare Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.

The margin offers the Jewess again for Hodiah. Nothing is known explanatory of the descriptive word Garmite here. Its meaning, according to Gesenins, is \"bony.\" Eahtomoa is here distinguished from the same-spelt word in ver. 17 by the description the Maachathite, Maachad being a region at the foot of Hermon, bordering on and belonging to Syria.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Shimon were, Amnon, and Rinnah, Benhanan, and Tilon. And the sons of Ishi were, Zoheth, and Benzoheth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The names of this verse obtain no light from other passages. The Septuagint (Alexandrian), in loc., speaks of \"Someion, the father of Jomam,\" in the former verse which probably stands for this Shimon. Also the Septuagint for Vulgate, instead of counting Ben-hanan as the name of a third son, translate it, as of Rinnah \"son of Hanan.\" Ishi; not to be confused with ch. 2:31, son of Appaim. Our Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, does not translate Ben-zoheth, while the Hebrew would read naturally \"Zoheth, and the son of Zoheth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Shelah the son of Judah were, Er the father of Lecah, and Laadah the father of Mareshah, and the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen, of the house of Ashbea,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-23. - The first of these verses takes us back to 1 Chronicles 2:3, where the first three of the patriarch Judah's sons are introduced in the genealogy, as Er, Onan, and Shelah; where of Er it is said,\" He was evil in the sight of the Lord; and he slew him;\" and where nothing is added of Onan or Shelah. It would appear now that Shelah gave the name of the slain brother to his son. Respecting this Er of Lecah - with little doubt the name of a place - and Laadah, nothing else can be adduced; but Marebah (1 Chronicles 2:42) is the name of a place in the Shefelah, given in the same passage with Kailah and Nezib (Joshua 15:44; see also 2 Chronicles 11:8; 2 Chronicles 14:9). The fine linen (בּוּצ) here spoken of is, according to Gesenius, equivalent in this passage and in the later Hebrew, to the byssus of the Egyptians (Exodus 26:31; 2 Chronicles 3:14), the שֵׁשׁ, from which the Syrian byssus (Ezekiel 27:16), to which בּוּצ does more strictly apply, is distinguished in some other places. It was of fine texture, costly, and used as the clothing of kings (1 Chronicles 15:27), of priests (2 Chronicles 5:12), and of the very wealthy (Esther 1:6; Esther 8:15). Gesenius says that, after long research and dispute, microscopic investigations in London have concluded that the threads of the cloth of byssus are linen, not cotton. Ashbea (אַשבֵּע) is not yet recognized elsewhere. Jokim. Gesenius considers this name (יוקִים) as a contracted form of יויָקִים (Joiakim) of Nehemiah 12:10. Chozeba. The meaning of this name is \"lying;\" not found elsewhere, it is probably the same as the אַכזִיב, a town in the tribe of Judah (Genesis 38:5), and that is probably the same as the אַכזִיבּ, of the \"valley\" list of Judah cities (Joshua 15:44) and of Micah 1:14, where it is mentioned in near connection with the Mareshah, which also accompanies it in the above \"valley\" list. Joash. This name appears in three forms: יואָשׁ, as in the text and 2 Kings 12:20; יְחואָשׁ, as in 2 Kings 12:1; and יועָשׁ, as in 1 Chronicles 7:8. Seraph. This is the word the plural of which gives us our seraphim (Isaiah 6:2), and is from a root of somewhat uncertain meaning. The different significations to which the root seems to lend itself in the substantive, according as it is used in the singular or plural, are startling (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub voce). The apparent meaning of this verse is that there was a time of old, when the above, of whom we can ascertain nothing elsewhere, ruled over Moab. Jerome, in the Vulgate, has made a strange rendering of this verse by translating some of the proper names, and reading at least one of them, the first, as though it were a form in the Hebrew (יָקִים), which it is not: Et qui stare fecit solem, virique Mendacii et Securus et Tircendens, qui principes fuerunt in Moab et qui reversi sunt in Lahem; haec autem verba vetera. Thus Jokim is turned into Elimelech, and the men of Chozeba into Mahlon and Chillon of the Book of Ruth, and Jashubi-lehem into Naomi and Ruth; and the last clause of the verse is equivalent to citing the Book of Ruth. Barrington ('Genealogies,' 1:179) regards Jokim as Shelah's third son in this enumeration; and ethers regard Jashubi-lehem as his fourth son. The preposition לְ prefixed to מואָב and following the verb, is to be noted Ver. 23 brings us to the last of Judah, and leaves us to part with the account of the tribe in the same obscurity which has lately involved it. The plants and hedges are probably an instance of inopportune translation of proper names, which should rather appear as Nelaira and Gedara, the former place or people not found elsewhere, but the latter possibly referred to. Joshua 15:36. Again, who they were that were the potters, is not clear - whether all of the preceding verse, or the last mentioned. From the last clause it may be probably safely concluded, that those designated, whoever they were, were employed habitually in the service, not indeed of one king necessarily, but of the succession of royalty. Passages that may be taken to throw interesting light upon this subject are 1 Chronicles 27:25-31; 2 Chronicles 26:10; 2 Chronicles 27:4; 2 Chronicles 32:27-29.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem.

The comparison of the enumeration of the sons of Simeon here with that in Genesis 46:10, Exodus 6:15, is helpful in detaching the idea that the compiler of Chronicles copied direct from Genesis and Exodus, or that he depended exclusively on identical sources of information. That comparison shows six names in both of those passages for only five here, and it shows also difference in three of the names, viz. Jemuel, Zohar, and Jachin, for Nemuel, Zeta, and Jarib. On the other hand, the list of Numbers 26:12 is in exact agreement with our list here (the omission of Ohad in both being sufficiently accounted for by one and the same reason), with the exception of Jarib here for Jachin still there; and this solitary difference may justly be suspected to be nothing but an early corruption of resh for caph and beth for nun (see Kennicott, 'Diss.,' 1:178; Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:55). Ver. 25 contains three descents from one of these - Shaul. Of Shallum, the first, it may be noted that there are fourteen others of the same name in the Old Testament; and of Mibsam and Mishma (whom some call brothers, surely in error), that there were others of the same name (and certainly given as brothers), viz. the sons of Ishmael (Genesis 25:13; ch. 1:29). Ver. 26 adds apparently another three descents, viz. from Mishma. Of the first-named of these, Hamuel, it may be noted that the name appears in many Hebrew manuscripts as Chammuel; of the second-named, Zacchur, that six others of the same name (though the Authorized Version gives them Zaccur) are found in Numbers, the First Book of Chronicles, and Nehemiah; while on the third, Shimei (of which name the Old Testament contains fifteen others), our attention is especially detained as father of sixteen sons and six daughters, though it is observed that his brethren (query Hammuel and Zacchur) had not large families. The smallness of the whole tribe relatively to Judah, was only saved from being smaller by him. With this agrees the census of Numbers 1:23, 27; Numbers 2:4, 13; Numbers 26:14.

They were carved out of the \"portion of Judah,\" which had been found disproportioned during the interval that elapsed between the first settlements, viz. of Judah and the sons of Joseph, and the completion of the settlements westward of Jordan (Joshua 18:1-6; comp. Judges 1:3, 17). From the second of these groups, Tochen (see suggestion in' Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.) is omitted in Joshua 19:7, where only \"four cities\" are summed. The allusion (ver. 31) to the reign of David is sufficiently explained by the fact that during his persecuted wanderings he was often in the portion of Simeon, to three of the cities of which he sent presents from the spoils of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 30:26-31); and Ziklag became his own (1 Samuel 27:6), special mention being made of how it passed into the tribe of Judah. The fuller name of Baal (ver. 33) is given as Baalath-beer in Joshua 19:8, where it is followed by the addition \"Ramath [height] of the south.\" It may be noted that this description of the allotment of Simeon begins with Beer-sheba and ends with Baalath-beer. The expression (ver. 33), and their genealogy\" - הִתְיַחְשָׂם infinitive Hithp., used as a noun - will be more properly translated, their table of genealogy, or their registration. The following לָהֶם may then refer to \"their habitations\" rather than themselves, so that the clause, as a whole, would mean, \"These were their dwellings, and their registration was correct to them.\" Bertheau, however, takes the meaning to be, \"And there was their family register to them,\" i.e. \"They had their own family register.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at Shaaraim.

They were thirteen princes of the tribe of Simeon who led the movement, possibly representing respectively the \"thirteen cities\" given above. The movement took place in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah (B.C. 726-698). That the house of their fathers had increased greatly is probably mentioned as some explanation of the cause of the movement. Though in one name out of the thirteen (ver. 35) the ancestors are traced to the third generation, and in another (ver. 37) to the fifth, no name is reached of the sons of Simeon enumerated in vers. 24-27. These mentioned by names is to be translated strictly these coming by names; and it is open to question whether the word of ver. 41, הכְּתוּבִים, be not omitted after הַבָּאִים; so that the passage would read, \"These that came, written by names, were princes in their families.\" Of the names, twenty-two in all, found in these verses, just so much is known as is here written.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese mentioned by their names were princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - The place Gedor cannot be identified in this connection. There is a town of the name situated in the mountainous district of Judah between Halhul and Beth-zur, to the north of Hebron (Joshua 15:58). It is evident that this cannot be the place we require here. There is another town of the name (1 Chronicles 12:7), probably belonging to Benjamin, and which as little admits of being fitted in here. Both the Alexandrine and the Vatican Codex of the Septuagint, however, evidently read גְּדרָ for גְּדֹר. Now, Gerar of the Philistines would suit well for position and description, and also (Genesis 10:14) for the allusion found here (ver. 40) to the dwelling there \"of old\" of the people of Ham. The Hebrew word, however, generally applied to the valley of Gerar (נַחַל, wady) is not the word used here of Gedor (הַגָיְא, ravine). See Stanley's 'Syria and Palestine,' p. 159, and note. Not only are references frequent to the fertility of Gerar, but the significance of that in 2 Chronicles 14:14 speaks for itself. This alteration of reading, however, with acceptance of the Septuagint manuscripts, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory, and Keil ('Comm.,' in loc.) offers some suggestions of weight against those of Ewald, Bertheau, and others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. The habitations that were found there. So the Authorized Version, which has mistakenly Englished a word which should have been left a proper name, \"the Maon-ires,\" i.e. the people elsewhere called in the Authorized Version the Mahunim. In doing this, our translators followed the Targum, copied by Luther and Junius (but see Gesenius, 'Thesaurus,' 1002 a; 'Notes on Burckhardt,' 1069; Bertheau, in 'Chronik.;' and Septuagint reading). Unto this day, in this verse, as also in ver. 43, must not be understood to mark the date of the compiler of Chronicles, but that of the document or authority upon which he as a compiler drew - anterior, of course, to the Captivity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 42, 43. - These verses give the further exploits, with a view of settlement, of certain of the tribe of Simeon. And of them we should prefer to apply to those already mentioned (vers. 34-41), did the expression stand alone. But the following clause in apposition, of the sons of Simeon, seems intended to prevent the supposition that they are the Simeonites to whom alone allusion is made. Keil again ('Comm.,' in loc.) refers those intended to ver. 27, because he reads, for Ishi, the Shimei of ver. 27, on very insufficient grounds. It is a question whether the movement of ver. 42 is to be understood as arising out of that other the account of which closes in ver. 41, or whether it were not a co-ordinate movement. It still would probably enough spring from the same intrinsic causes. The allotment of the tribe of Simeon carved out of that of Judah was found too small for their growing numbers, though Simeon was not of the most numerous. Nor is it necessary to suppose - perhaps it is rather necessary to correct the impression - that this expedition, issuing in a permanent settlement, lay at all near the conquests of the \"thirteen princes.\" It is, on the whole, most natural to consider that one event concludes with ver. 41, and that the following events (vers. 42, 43) are distinct and independent. All requisite light as to who these \"smitten Amalekites\" were, is for them too significantly furnished by comparison of 1 Samuel 27:8; 1 Samuel 30:1; 2 Samuel 8:12; with 1 Samuel 14:48; 1 Samuel 15:7. Of the names, five in number, found in this verse, just so much and no more is known.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles4:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINE","1Chr.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - THE SONS OF REUBEN. The tribe of Reuben is now taken third in order by the compiler, though Reuben was the first of all the sons of Israel. The distinct statements of vers. 1 and 2, respecting the degradation of Reuben and his loss of the rights of primogeniture, are not to be understood, however, as mentioned in any way to account for his standing third here. That Judah takes in any genealogy the first place needs no other apology than that contained in this passage, \"Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler\" (i.e. David, and in him \"David's greater Son and Lord\"). And that Simeon is taken immediately after Judah was natural enough, both because the second place belonged to him, and because his tribe, in journeying, in settlement, and in acknowledged friendship, was so nearly related to that of Judah. It is as an important historical fact, a lesson and stern memento of crime, that the tale of Reuben is here as elsewhere told. Indeed, in the remarkably exalting language applied to Reuben (Genesis 49:3) by the dying father in those \"blessings\" of his sons which were so marvellously living with prophecy, that \"blessing\" seemed weighted with hard reality, and may really carry this meaning: \"O Reuben I though thou art my firstborn, though my might and the beginning of my strength, though the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power,\" yet, because of thy boiling lust (Genesis 35:22) \"thou shall not excel.\" In that endowing charter of the patriarch's death-bed, the birthright of Reuben is not in so many words given to Joseph and his sons, but what is given to Joseph is so abundant above the lot of all the others, that we find no difficulty in accepting the formal statement of the fact here first found in this passage. The large measure of promise meted to Judah (Genesis 49:8-12) rests, no doubt, upon the title already referred to. There would seem to be also a righteous moral reason in Joseph after all becoming heir to the birthright, inasmuch as he was the eldest child of her who was Israel's real love, and who, but for deception and sharp practice, would have been his first wife. How he remembered her, and with what determined practical consequence, the affecting passage, Genesis 48:1-7, 16, 21, 22, sufficiently reveals; yet comp. Deuteronomy 21:15-17. The meaning of the last clause of ver. 1 is evidently that, though thus Reuben was the natural firstborn, and Joseph had really the birthright, the registration did not proceed in this instance (probably partly for the very reason of the ambiguity) by the order of birthright, but everything yielded to the special call for precedence on the part of Judah (ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The four sons of Reuben here given are first enumerated in Genesis 46:9; then in Exodus 6:14; and again in Numbers 26:5-7, where are also found the corresponding chief families of the tribe, the total of their fighting numbers amounting to 43,730, compared with 46,500 at the time of the Sinai census (Numbers 2:11), a diminution due to the plague for the idolatry of Baal-peor (Numbers 25:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-6. - From which of the four sons of Reuben the line came in which Joel would appear, we do not know. Juntas and Tremellius say Hanoch, others Carmi, while the Syriac Version has Carrot vice Joel. It is to be remarked that in Numbers 26:8-10 a line of descent through Pallu is given, but reaching only to the second generation, Beerah in the present list will be only ninth at furthest from Reuben, so that it is evident that it is a very fragmentary genealogy, whether the hiatus be only one, viz. between Reuben's son (whichever it may be in question) and Joel, or whether both there and elsewhere also. Of none of the eight persons beginning with Joel and ending with Beerah is anything else known, unless either Shemaiah or Shimei may be identical with the Shema of ver. 8, in which case it might be also that the Joel of ver. 8 is identical with that of ver. 4. In this passage and 1 Chronicles 8:30 Baal appears as the name of a man. In this passage, and in ver. 26 and 2 Chronicles 28:20, we have a different form in each part of the word, of the Tiglath-pileser of 2 Kings 15:29; 2 Kings 16:7. These slight differences in the position of the radicals, with the introduction or omission of the א, make as many as four different readings in the Hebrew. Tiglath-pileser, the second Assyrian king who came into conflict with the Israelites, reigned about B.C. 747-727. Gesenius thinks that the former half of the word is the same as Diglath, i.q. Tigris; and that the latter, a root occurring also in the name Nabo-pola-saris, is from an Assyrian verb meaning \"to guard.\" He translates the word as \"Lord of the Tigris.\" The Assyrian reproduction of the name is Tigulti-pal-tsira (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), or Tukulti-pal-zara ('Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.). The Captivity is spoken of further in the last verse of this chapter and in 2 Kings 15:27-31. The Septuagint reads vers. 4 and 5 differently: \"The sons of Joel, Semei and Banaea his son; and the sons of Gog the son of Semei,\" etc., and this in all three editions - Vatican, Alexandrine, and Aldine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMicah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - Of Jeiel, Zechariah, Bela, and Asaz nothing further is known. Shema and Joel may be those of ver. 4, as above. The expression, his brethren, i.e. the brethren of Beerah, must be read generally. The intimation, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, is probably explained by the contents of ver. 17 (of which hereafter). Aroer (עֲרֹעֵר or עְרועֵר); a place east of the Jordan, overhanging the torrent of Arnon, which was a boundary between Moab and the Amorites, and afterwards between Moab and Reuben. There is little doubt that Burckhardt has identified the ruins of Aroer (see Numbers 32:38; Deuteronomy 2:24, 36; Deuteronomy 3:8, 12, 16; Joshua 12:1, 2; Joshua 13:9, 16; Judges 11:13, 26, where note transposition of letters in the Hebrews 1; 2 Kings 10:33). Moab seems to have regained it later (Jeremiah 48:1-47; see interesting arts. \"Amen\" and \"Areer,\" Smith's' Bible Dictionary'). Nebo and Baal-meon are also mentioned together in Numbers 32:38; and Baal-meon with Moab in Ezekiel 25:9. This Nebo, the town, is distinct from Mount Nebo. It is remarkable that it is not mentioned, unless under one of the \"changed\" names (Numbers 32:38), in the list of the towns of Reuben (Joshua 13:15-23). Nebo was the name of a heathen deity, known among the Chaldeans (Isaiah 46:1), Babylonians, and Assyrians; and this constituted one reason, if not the reason, for changing its name when it had been affixed to the Moabite city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Keil and others refer this verse to the people of Bela; yet others apply it to Joel It would seem nearest the facts to apply it to the main subject of the paragraph - Reuben. Gilead (Deuteronomy 3:12-16) had for its boundaries, on the north Bashan, on the south Moab, on the east the Arabian desert. Its situation evidently exposed it to Assyrian invasion and frequent encounter with desert tribes (Joshua 17:1; Numbers 26:29, 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Among such conflicts, one with a people descended presumably from Hagar or Ishmael (though 1 Chronicles 27:30, 31, and Psalm 83:6 are somewhat needlessly interpreted to be opposed to this) is here alluded to. It takes us to the time of Saul, and from that time up to the time of \"the Captivity\" (ver. 22) the victorious Reubenites, Gadites, and people of the half-tribe Manasseh had the benefit of enlarged domain at their expense: \"They dwelt in their steads,\" after seizing great spoil. It is exceedingly likely that we have the perpetuation of the name Hagarenes in the Agraeei (modern Hejer) of Strabo, 16:767; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:32; Dionysius, 'Perieg.,' 956; Pt. 5:2 (see art. \"Hagarenes\" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-17. - The tribe of Gad is taken next, and occupies but few lines. Gad was born seventh in order of all the sons of Jacob (Genesis 30:9-12), and first of the children of Leah's maid Zilpah. The compiler seems to pass easily on to Gad, from the mere circumstance of the name of the tribe being so constantly linked with that preceding, in the matter of local settlement on the east of Jordan, after the journeyings of the wilderness (Joshua 13:7, 8). The geography in vers. 11 and 16 offers very little difficulty. Compared with the time of the first settling of the Gadites (Deuteronomy 3:10-13; Joshua 13:25, 30), it is evident that they had pushed their borders further to the north, trenching somewhat upon the lot of the half-tribe Manasseh, as they also in turn extended their limits northward to Hermon (ver. 23). This reconciles Joshua 13:30 with the present passage. Salcah, or (Authorized Version) Salchah (Deuteronomy 3:10; Joshua 13:11), is probably to be identified as the modern Sulkhad, at the extreme eastern point of the plain Hauran, which is bordered by the desert. \"In Gilead in Bashan\" may be read, with some, as two coordinate places, separating them by a stop; or may point to a time when Bashan included the upper half of Gilead. Sharon, which Keil, quoting Reland, 'Pal. Ill.,' 370, would make the well-known Sharon of Carmel and the Mediterranean, is, though unmentioned elsewhere, probably distinguished sufficiently from it by the absence of the article, which is invariably prefixed to the other. Stanley's suggestion ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 484, 485, 260) would seem exceedingly apt, that it is one in fact, as one in derivation and meaning, with the Mishor (i.e. \"level ]ands,\" \"table-land\") of Gilead and Bashan. With this explanation, however, the term \"suburbs\" does not so well agree. Upon the other side, distant as the well-known Sharon is, a link of connection might be found with it, in that the other Manasseh half-tribe stretched into its plains; and in that case the last word of the verse, תּועְאותָם, might mean (Joshua 17:9) \"the outgoings\" of the land or regions in question to the \"sea\"-coast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJoel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The four proper names in this verse are not known in connection with the same persons elsewhere.

This chapter (see ver. 7) seems to introduce the use of this word, which must be understood generically. The seven persons are nowhere else mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - These are the children of Abihail; i.e. the seven \"brethren\" of the preceding verse. A rapid line of descent, or rather of ascent, consisting of ten generations, from Abihail to Guni, here follows. The division between these verses has unfortunately cut in half one name, i.e. Buzaki. The translators of the Septuagint saw that the two verses composed one line of ascent, but instead of piecing \"Aki\" to \"Buz,\" translated it as\" brother.\" Though this line takes us some way back, we find nowhere else any clue or identification of any of these ten persons. Of the twenty-one persons in all, therefore, named as belonging to the tribe of Gad, nothing else is known; and we have nothing to guide us to connect them with any one rather than another of the original\" sons of Gad\" (Genesis 46:16; Numbers 16:15-18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAhi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The very form of the language of this verse would indicate that two genealogies are intended. This quite tallies with the fact that there were two chronicles, one for each division of the nation, i.e. \"the chronicles of the kings of Judah\" (2 Kings 15:6) and \"the chronicles of the kings of Israel\" (2 Kings 15:11), in which same chapter both Jeroboam (II.) of Israel and Jotham of Judah are spoken of, the latter beginning to reign in Judah some twenty years (the exact chronology is very confused here) after the death of the former. Although presumably it would be an object of closer interest with Israel than with Judah to effect the registration of the Gadite genealogy, yet it was most just that Judah should do so as well. This would both vindicate Judah's own right place and be a happy omen of the continued predominance of her position compared with that of Israel. Independently of the question of effecting the actual registration, however, it is quite possible that, so long as history ran by the side of history. Israel would gather and keep all it could of Judah, and Judah all it could of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-22. - These verses appear to be the fuller development of the war in Saul's time, mentioned in ver. 10 - the account apparently there delayed till the genealogy of the tribe of Gad had been given, and which still seems premature till the contents of vers. 23 and 24 should have been given.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The name of Nodab we have not elsewhere; but those of Jetur and Nephish are names from the very origin of the tribe of Ishmael (Genesis 25:13-16; 1 Chronicles 1:29-31). It would be possible to consider them here as in apposition with the description, the Hagarites (respecting whom see note on ver. 10); but they may more probably be regarded as favourite names, still repeated in the descendants of the tribe. The people of Nephish have not made their mark deep on the page of ethnographic history; but the people of Jetur have done so. Their stinted territory appears in the name Ituraea (Luke 3:1). Their people reappear also (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13. e. 11, § 3; Strabo, 16:518, 520). Nor is it an unnoticeable contribution to the truth of our history here to put, side by side with the description of the qualities and of the arms and weapons of warfare of the Manassites and their helpers of Reuben and Gad (ver. 18), those of the Ituraeans, their antagonists (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:448; Cicero, 'Philippians,' 2:44; Luean, 'Pharsalia,' 7:230; see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:905).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Of men; literally, of the soul, i.e. life of men (comp. 2 Kings 7:7 with Jeremiah 44:7, in illustration of the twofold application of נֶפֶשׁ; see also Numbers 31:19, 28, 32-35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.

Manasseh and his brother Ephraim stand in the place of Joseph, both the children of Joseph's Egyptian wife, Asenath, and born before the famine. Though Manasseh was the elder, Jacob gave the chief blessing (Genesis 48:10-22) to Ephraim. The Manassites were descended from Manasseh through his son Machir, born of a Syrian concubine (Septuagint, Genesis 46:20; Genesis 1:23; Numbers 26:28-34; Joshua 17:1-3; 1 Chronicles 7:14, 15). Machir evidently was spes gregis (though apparently not the only son, for see Asriel, or Ashriel, in above references), and is repeatedly mentioned with his sou Gilead. It is probable that the division of the tribe was determined partly according to the energy of those who composed it at the time of division - the more warlike being more adapted to the east of Jordan. Nevertheless Machir is distinctly mentioned westward, as well as with Gilead eastward (comp. Judges 5:14-17; Joshua 13:29-31). (For the further prosecution of this part of the subject, see Exposition, 1 Chronicles 7:14-19.) Verse 23. - Baal-hermon, etc. These three names need scarcely be read as different names for exactly the same region, but as designating different sides or heights of what was essentially one and the same well-known mountain district, with which would agree Psalm 43:6, \"Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.' So Deuteronomy 3:8-10 tells us that Hermon was called Sirion by the Sidonians; Shenir, i.q.

And the suggestion of Grove is likely enough, that Baal-hermon was the Phoenician cast of the name.

Verse 25. - And they went a-whoring (וַיַּזְנוּ); so 2 Chronicles 21:11, 13. This verb, in one form of its root or another, occurs as many as ninety-seven times in the Pentateuch, Judges, Joshua, Psalms, Proverbs; and prophets, for only twice in Kings and four times in Chronicles, in all the rest of the Old Testament writings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Pul and Tilgath-pilneser. These two were chosen ministers of God's will, if not ministers of himself. We can identify the date of this punishment which befell the transgressing Israelites east of the Jordan. The visit of the former, in the reign of Menahem (2 Kings 15:15-20), may be interpreted and might have operated as a lesson and a warning. He was bought off with a thousand talents of silver. It seems to be said with significance,\" So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.\" It was in the reign of Pekah, the usurping successor of Menahem's son Pekahiah, that the completer punishment fell, and Tilgath-pilneser effected the captivity spoken of here and in 2 Kings 15:27-29. The name Pul cannot, it would appear, be a pure Assyrian name, and there is reason to think it may be identified with Vul-lush (grandson of the Shalmaneser who warred with Benhadad, etc.), a name found on Assyrian monuments, and belonging to a king who reigned at Calah, B.C. 8004750 (see art. \"Pul,\" Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). Tilqath-pilneser (see notes on ver. 6) was probably the founder of the lower dynasty of Assyria, and first king of the new empire. His first invasion was one chiefly of Israel and Samaria (2 Kings 15:29; Isaiah 9:1). His second was of a much more significant character. Called in to aid Judah under Ahaz against Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Syria in alliance, he both conquered these latter and brought into vassalage Judah itself (2 Kings 15:37; 2 Kings 16:9, 10; 2 Chronicles 28:6-8; Isaiah 9:1). Halah; Habor Hara; Gozan. This enumeration exceeds that of 2 Kings 17:6 by the addition of Hara, important as helping with consistent witness to the antiquity of the region described. Halah (not the \"Calah\" of Genesis 10:11) is believed to be identifiable with Chalcitis, its verbal resemblance to which comes out a little more evidently in its Hebrew form (חֲלַח). A trace of it possibly remains in the name of a hill, Gla, on the Khabour, i.q. Habor of this passage, an important tributary of the Euphrates, and not the \"Chebar\" of Ezekiel. This name Khabour is found in an Assyrian inscription dating upwards of eight centuries before Christ. The mention of Habor in 2 Kings 17:6 and 2 Kings 18:11 is, in the Authorized Version, made to convey the impression of a place \"by\" the \"river of Gozan,\" instead of being, what the Hebrew says, \"the river of Gozan.\" Here, on the other hand, Gozan is, in the Authorized Version, incorrectly translated as a river itself, instead of the region of a river. It is, according to the testimony of Layard ('Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 270-312), a remarkably fertile tract, being the Gauzanitis of Ptolemy, and substantially the Mygdonia of Polybius and Strabo. Hara; חָרָה, with little doubt, the same as חָרָן, Haran, or Charran (Genesis 11:31), the ancient adopted home of Abraham, in Padan-aram, in Mesopotamia, on the Belik, a small tributary of the Euphrates. It is the Greek Carrhae of Strabo and Polybius. These four names purport to give us, probably in brief, the information that those of the Captivity here alluded to were divided - some to settle at Halab on one river, some in Hara on another, and the rest in the district called Gauzanitis. The region called Halah and that called Gau-zanitis, however, were both watered by the Khabour, and therefore the insertion of the name Haran where it is inserted occasions some difficulty.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This verse gives the three branches of Levi,and is in agreement with the enumeration of them in Genesis 46:11 and Exodus 6:16, viz.

He was one of the travellers with Jacob into Egypt, was probably about twenty years the junior of Joseph, lived thirty years after his death, and attained the age of one hundred and thirty-three years, after a residence in Egypt of about one hundred and fifteen years in all. The Kohathites are expressly mentioned in their sacred duties in the time of David (1 Chronicles 15:5-8), and in the time of Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 29:12-14). The four sons of Kohath are next instanced, in order to get another step nearer the clear beginning of the priest line. This is done in the person of the oldest brother, Amram, who became father of Aaron and Moses and Miriam.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam.

From this name inclusive follow the twenty-two, which terminate with Jehozadak, who indeed never attained him s elf to the office of high priest, but was son of Geraiah, last high priest before the Captivity, and father of Jeshua, high priest, who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity. It has been pointed out by Lord A. C. Hervey that the name Jehozadak is of the same meaning with Zedekiah, the last king before the Captivity; and that Jeshua is the same in meaning with Joshua, the leader of the tribes into Canaan. The two elder brothers of Eleazar, viz. Nadab and Abihu, died without issue (Leviticus 10:1; Numbers 3:4, 32; Numbers 20:28; ch. 24:1-3). It is somewhat obscurely said that the sacred office remained in the family of Eleazar till, in the person of Eli, it passed awhile into that of Ithamar, his brother (1 Kings 2:26, 27; Josephus, 8:1, § 3), to be recovered again in the Zadok of our ver. 9 (1 Chronicles 24:3, 4). Phinehas; a memorable man (Numbers 25:7-13; Joshua 22:10-33; Judges 20:28; Psalm 106:30, 31; which Grove well compares with Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3). Abishua; only mentioned in this chapter and Ezra 7:1-5. Josephus (8:1, § 3) asserts that he it was who was succeeded in the high priesthood, not by any one of his own descendants, but by Eli, till Zedok, in the time of David, all the intervening members of the Eleazar family being private individuals. But no reliance can be placed on this assertion, for see Josephus again (5:11, § 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abishua begat Bukki, and Bukki begat Uzzi,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - Of the five succeeding names, Bukki, Uzzi, Zerahiah, Meraioth, Amariah, it may be said that they reappear in the list of Ezra 7, but that little or nothing else is known of them. Lightfoot ('Temple Service,' 4. § 1) supposes that the change of priesthood family to Ithamar took place after Meraioth. But it is just as probable that the gap between Abishua and Eli, or possibly even between Phinehas and Eli, was filled by holders of the high priest office unknown by name to us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Uzzi begat Zerahiah, and Zerahiah begat Meraioth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMeraioth begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Ahitub. With this name begins the light again. Ahitub, Zadok, Ahimaaz, and Azariah are of frequent mention in the Books of Samuel and Kings. Ahitub, here and elsewhere plainly given as father of Zadok, seems to be given as father of Meraioth in 1 Chronicles 9:11 and Nehemiah 11:11, and grandfather of Zadok; and in both passages is termed \"ruler of the house of God\" - an expression probably equivalent to high priest, as Azariah, high priest in the reign of Hezekiah, is also so described (2 Chronicles 31:13). The recurrence of the two names Ahitub and Zadok in vers. 11 and 12 is very possibly the result of some error; and it is in favour of such a supposition, in some form of it, at all events, that in that place, where, including Shallum (or Meshullam), only three steps are found, several more seem to be required - the period one of some one hundred and eighty years, and filled in the list of Judah's kings by as many as nine in succession. On the other hand, it is open to question whether the recurrence of the names Ahitub and Zadok be not legitimate. And this may then be the solution of 1 Chronicles 9:11 and Nehemiah 11:11, as above, with their insertion of Meraioth - still other names being absent which would make up the requisite number of generations. Zadok. The earliest glimpse we get of him is in 1 Chronicles 12:28, where he is introduced as \"a young man mighty of valour,\" who now casts in his lot with David at Hebron, on Saul's death. In 2 Samuel 15:24, 29, 35, we find him and Abiathar the recognized priests. In 1 Kings 1:7, 8, we find him true to David when Abiathar joined Adonijah - the punishment of the latter and the reward of the former being recorded in 1 Kings 2:27, 35, respectively. Up to that time it is evident. that Abiathar had precedence in rank over Zadok. His death is not recorded, but it must be assigned to a date previous to the dedication of the temple, from the account of which (1 Kings 8.) his name is entirely absent. The last allusions to him are in 1 Kings 4:2, 4; in the latter of which verses (specially coupled as the name is with the deposed Abiathar) the notice is probably as merely historical as it certainly is in the former. This same verse states that Azariah was \"the priest,\" and that he was son, i.q. grandson, of Zadok, proving, with very little doubt, that the explanatory parenthesis of our ver. 10 should follow the Azariah mentioned in the previous verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Ahimaaz. The first important notice of him is found in 2 Samuel 15:36, and the last in 2 Samuel 19:29. He is not to be identified with Solomon's\" officer\" in Naphtali (1 Kings 4:15). Azariah. As above said, it is almost without a doubt after this Azariah (1 Kings 4:2) that the parenthetical comment of next verse should be read. Again, this Azariah must not be identified with him of the time of King Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:17, 20), who must have been nearly a century later, and was contemporary with Isaiah, Joel, and Amos.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Of Johanan and Azariah, his son, nothing can be found with any certainty.

Seraiah; found also in Nehemiah 11:11, in a list which omits the preceding Azariah, and in Ezra 7:1. The end of his high priesthood and of himself is recorded with that of Zephaniah (2 Kings 25:18, 21), and (not the Seraiah, \"the quiet prince,\" of Jeremiah 51:59-64) he is also spoken of in Jeremiah 52:24-27.

Where this name occurs in Haggai and Zechariah, it is the same in the Hebrew as here, though Englished in the Authorized Version as Josedech. Where it occurs in Ezra and Nehemiah, the shorter form of Jozadak is found in the Hebrew as in the Authorized Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16-19. - These verses have a re-enumeration of the three sons of Levi, and differ from the enumeration of ver. 1, in being followed by the sons of each of these three, and afterwards by the line of descendants from each, instead of by the sons of only one, Kohath, and his descendant in only one stem, the high priest stem, and with only one object. All these names agree with Exodus 6:17-19 and Numbers 3:17-20 (comp. also Numbers 3:21-36 with Numbers 26:57-60), with the trifling exceptions already alluded to, in the Hebrew spelling of Gershom and the Authorized Version spelling of Shimei and the Authorized Version Mahali of Exodus 6:19. The latter half of ver. 19, according to the Hebrew, should rather refer to what has preceded, and be a \"subscription,\" though it might best suit the connection to regard it as introducing what was to follow, and as being a \"superscription.\" Bertheau holds with the former of these views, Keil with the latter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and Shimei.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Kohath were, Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi.

The question is whether this list of seven is part of the longer list of thirteen from Gershom (vers. 39-43). terminating with Asaph; and it seems impossible to decide the question satisfactorily. From the occurrence of the name Shimei in this latter, though in the wrong place, viz. after Jahath in the descending order, instead of before him, some think, Keil and Zockler among them, that it is a line from Shimei, the brother of Libni, and second son of Gershom. If this be so, the occurrence of three names, the same and in the same order, is a thing to be remarked, though possible enough in itself. But if not, then either the names Joah, Iddo, Jeaterai, in the former list, must be interchangeable with Ethan, Adaiah, Ethni, respectively in the latter (a thing which the similarity of the Hebrew letters might render credible), while the Shimei of ver. 42 is omitted from ver. 20, and the Libni of ver. 20 from ver. 43; or the one list must pick up some links and leave others, and the other do likewise, whilst those taken the same by both are in the minority. This last supposition may be the more probable, though not free from difficulty. Zimmah. Beside the uncertainty of the identity of this Zimmah with the same name in ver. 42, it is very remarkable that we find a Zimmah, also father of a Joah, in 2 Chronicles 29:12; also in this same passage we find three other reproductions of a similar kind - father and son-of what have first been found in this sixth chapter, viz. \"Mahath, son of Amasai\" (ver. 35); \"Joel, son of Azariah\" (ver. 36); \"Kish, son of Abdi\" (ver. 44). It seems as though the individual descendant was quoted in these instances by the name of the ancestor at a certain point.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJoah his son, Iddo his son, Zerah his son, Jeaterai his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-28. - (B) These verses give descendants, probably twenty-one in number, from Levi, through his second son, Kohath, to Joel, eldest son of Samuel and (ver. 33) father of Heman. The descendants of Kohath through his eldest son, Amram, have been given from vers. 3-15. But the descendants now to he spoken of are through another son, here called Am-minadab, a name not appearing among the four of ver. 2, but apparently standing for the Izhar of that verse. For he is said to have a son Korah, by whom, indeed, the genealogy moves on, while in vers. 37, 38. and Numbers 16:1, Korah is said to be the son of Izhar. Without the occurrence of this clue, we should have been at a loss to tell who Amminadab was, as we are now at a loss to explain the unexplained substitution of this new name. The Vatican Septuagint has Amminadab, while the Alexandrine has altered to Izhar, probably deeming the other name a mere error. Verses 22, 23. - Korah (comp. Numbers 16:27, 32, 33, with Numbers 26:9-11). From Exodus 6:24 we also learn that the throe next in lineal succession to Korah, were Assir, Elkanah, and Ebiasaph, or Abiasaph; though Elkanah and Assir are omitted from ver. 37, in the ascending line.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElkanah his son, and Ebiasaph his son, and Assir his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTahath his son, Uriel his son, Uzziah his son, and Shaul his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-28. - Tahath. From this name onwards to the end of ver. 28 we must have recourse to the reversed list of vers. 33 37, in order to make out our way. Even then we shall scarcely have a chain of all the licks; e.g. there is no evidence here (as there is in the case of Amminadab above) that Uriel and Zephaniah designate the same person. The lists may be brought, however, into pretty close harmony without any violent suppositions or substitutions, thus: Tahath, Uriel, Zephaniah, Uzziah (i.q. Azariah), Shaul (i.q. Joel), Elkanah, Amasai, Ahimoth (i.q. Mahath), Elkanah Zophai (i.q. Zuph), Nahath (i.q. Toah, Tohu, 1 Samuel 1:1), Eliab (i.q. Eliel, Elihu, 1 Samuel 1:1), Jeroham, Elkanah, Samuel (i.q.

From comparison of Numbers 3:20 and Numbers 26:58 there can be no doubt that Mahli and Mushi were brothers, each of whom founded a family.

It was given to David to settle the ark after its travels through the wilderness, its sojourn in various places since then, doubtless always within the care of some Levitical family (except when taken by enemies, 1 Samuel 4:11; 1 Samuel 5, 6.), and in especial its prolonged twenty years' sojourn at Kirjath-jearim (1 Samuel 7:1, 2; 2 Samuel 6:1-19; 1 Chronicles 13:3-14; 1 Chronicles 15:1-3; 1 Chronicles 17:5). It now had rest, though its place of rest was only within \"curtains\" (2 Samuel 7:2; 1 Chronicles 17:1), i.e. in a special separate tent prepared for it by David, which tent was probably the suggestion, and as it were the nucleus, of the coming grand temple itself - the house of God. The event was naturally one of great joy and thanksgiving, of which David himself was the chief leader (2 Samuel 6:17-21; 1 Chronicles 16:1-3); but it appears also that it furnished the occasion of appointing fixed choir conductors, leaders of the service of song\" (1 Chronicles 16:4-7, 37, 41, 42; 1 Chronicles 25:1-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing, until Solomon had built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem: and then they waited on their office according to their order.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32.

So the place of Heman was still the place of honor, in the centre, with Asaph on the right and Ethan on the left (vers. 39, 44). Heman is the twenty-first according to this list (vers. 33-38) after Levi, but the genealogy is indistinct (see above, vers. 22-28) between Shemuel and Assir, and according to Hervey ('Genealogies of our Lord,' p. 214), Heman comes fourteenth after Levi. This Heman is to be distinguished from Heman the \"son of Zerah\" (1 Chronicles 2:6), and with but little doubt, therefore, from Heman the Ezrahite (Zerahite) of Psalm 88. On the other hand, a theory has been suggested by Lord Arthur C. Hervey which might reconcile the two. He supposes that if Heman the Kohathite (or his father) had married an heiress of the house of Zerah, he might have become reckoned in the line of Zerah as well as in that of Kohath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliel, the son of Toah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Zuph, the son of Elkanah, the son of Mahath, the son of Amasai,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Elkanah, the son of Joel, the son of Azariah, the son of Zephaniah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Tahath, the son of Assir, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his brother Asaph, who stood on his right hand, even Asaph the son of Berachiah, the son of Shimea,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Asaph is called brother of Heman, either as brother in office or generally as relative in the degree of cousin by many removes. He stands fourteenth in line of descent after Levi, while Ethan (ver. 44) stands thirteenth. If the line of Heman (as given in vers. 33-38) were correct. it would force on us the conviction that there are several omissions in these two lines; but if these are correct, we must conclude that there are unwarranted additions in the other. On the names of Asaph's ancestors, see notes on vers. 20, 21. From 2 Chronicles 29:30 it seems plain that Asaph was himself a composer of psalms, and not simply either the musician or rehearser of those of David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Michael, the son of Baaseiah, the son of Malchiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Ethan, the son of Zimmah, the son of Shimei,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Jahath, the son of Gershom, the son of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their brethren the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Ethan. This passage and 1 Chronicles 15:19 are the leading passages for this name Ethan. But in succeeding references (and they are not a few) to the three chief leaders of song, the name appears as Jeduthun; unless, as seems scarcely credible, two different persons are designated. The occasion and significance of the alteration of the name are not stated, however, and elude detection so far. In 2 Chronicles 35:15 the title of \"king's seer\" (חֶזֹה) is added to the name Jeduthun, which is variously spelt (יְדֻתוּן יתדוּתוּן ירְיִתוּן). This arrangement of chief singers, one from each of the three branches of Levi's family, lasted unbroken to Josiah's reign (2 Chronicles 35:13); and the representatives of Jeduthun, at all events, are mentioned in the time of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 11:17, 18). Kishi. The most frequent form of this name is Kish (קִישׁ, equivalent to the Vulgate Cis), if, indeed, the form of this verse and that of 1 Chronicles 15:17, Kushaiah (קוּשָׁיָהוּ), are not merely the fruit of a corrupt text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Hashabiah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Hilkiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Amzi, the son of Bani, the son of Shamer,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Mahli, the son of Mushi, the son of Merari, the son of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir brethren also the Levites were appointed unto all manner of service of the tabernacle of the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - The all manner of service, from that of the three \"leaders of song\" on their \"cymbals of brass\" (1 Chronicles 15:19) down through the other Levitical grades, is fully illustrated in many places (1 Chronicles 15:18-24; 1 Chronicles 16:37-42; 1 Chronicles 23:2-32; 1 Chronicles 25:1-8; 1 Chronicles 26:1-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt offering, and on the altar of incense, and were appointed for all the work of the place most holy, and to make an atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 49-53. - These verses allude to the more special functions of \"Aaron and his sons,\" as they are here called, i.e., his lineal descendants (vers. 4-15; Ezra 7:2-5), whose names, stopping at Ahimaaz, the eleventh generation, are the same with those of vers. 3-8. The manifest inference is that the present enumeration, stopping with the name of one contemporary with David (2 Samuel 15:27), was borrowed from tables of the date of David, and not of the date of the Captivity (ver. 15). Verse 49. - The altar of the burnt offering (Leviticus 1:3-17). The altar of incense (Exodus 25:6; Exodus 30:1-7, 7-9, 34-38; Leviticus 16:12). Most holy (Leviticus 16:12, 14, 15, 17, 20).

The third son of Aaron (by Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, and descended from Judah through Pharez) is the sea whose descendants are given here, inasmuch as he was appointed chief of the Levites (Numbers 3:32); ministered as a priest with his brother Ithamar, even before the death of Aaron; and succeeded him as high priest (Numbers 20:28). It was in Eleazar's family that the high priesthood remained (as above) till the time of Eli, who was descended from Ithamar, and it returned again to the line of Eleazar in Zadok, fulfilling the intimation of 1 Samuel 2:30.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBukki his son, Uzzi his son, Zerahiah his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMeraioth his son, Amariah his son, Ahitub his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTZadok his son, Ahimaaz his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites: for theirs was the lot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 54-81. - The writer returns upon his steps to give the cities and dwelling-places of the Levites, beginning with the priestly members of the Kohathite line (vers. 54-61), then taking those of the Gershomite (ver. 62) and Merarite lines (vers. 63-65) in order; and again in the same order disposing of the members not priestly (vers. 66-70; 71-76; 77-81) of the same three branches. Verses 54-61, 64-70. - And these are their dwellings according to their enclosures in their territories, טִירותָם means the settlements of whatever people in question, surrounded and protected by whatever fence or defence customary. For theirs was the lot is more intelligible with the addition of the word \"first,\" supplied in Joshua 31:10, i.e. theirs was the first lot. The whole drift of the present passage, with the remainder of the chapter, is made entirely plain by Numbers 35:1-8 and Joshua 21:1-10. But the omission and the alteration of individual names of places occasion some delay. Our ver. 55 is given somewhat more fully in Joshua 21:11; our ver. 56 is identical with Joshua 21:12; and our vers. 57-60 correspond substantially with Joshua 21:13-19, but from this latter source we are glad to supply the two names Juttah and Gibeon, without which we cannot add up correctly the thirteen cities of ver. 60. Also in Joshua, our Hilen, Ashan, and Alemsth appear as Holon, Ain, and Almon respectively, although in regard to the intermediate name of these three the places cannot be accepted as identical, for they are mentioned side by side in Joshua 19:7 and in 1 Chronicles 4:32, but we must admit an error involved. Ver. 56 (see Joshua 14:14; Joshua 21:12). Ver. 61 seems to be an anticipation of vers. 66-70, with which verses, if we incorporate it, we shall obtain substantially the same results as are found in Joshua 21:5, 20-26; but again we are glad of the latter source to supply for us the two places, Eltekeh and Gibbethon, necessary to enable us to count up the ten cities of our ver. 61, while our Jokmeam, Aner, and Bileam appear as probably the corrected readings of Kibzaim, Tanach, and Gath-rimmon respectively in Joshua. The sons of Kohath.., left (ver. 61), the residue (Authorized Version, ver. 66), the remnant (ver. 70), point (as above) to the non-priestly descendants in the Kohath line. Summing up, we see that the Kohathite priests had thirteen cities from the allotments of Judah and Simeon and Benjamin, and the Ko-hathite non-priests had ten, from Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh. One might detect in all this some germ of the more modern parochial system, so far at least as regards the distributed residence of a clerical and ministerial order, though not with sacred buildings similarly distributed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, and the suburbs thereof round about it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Judah, namely, Hebron, the city of refuge, and Libnah with her suburbs, and Jattir, and Eshtemoa, with their suburbs,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hilen with her suburbs, Debir with her suburbs,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ashan with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles6:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs.

Issachar was Jacob's fifth son by Leah (Genesis 35:23). In the list of Genesis 46:13 our Puah (פוּאָח) appears differently spelt as Phuvah (פֻוָּח), and Jashub is found as Job, which is corrected by the Samaritan Codex to Jashub, and this reading the Septuagint follows. In the other parallel passage (Numbers 26:23) the Phuvah form obtains, but the other names are the same as here. Tola. We read (Judges 10:1, 2) of another person of this name, who judged Israel twenty-three years, at Shamir, in Mount Ephraim, and who is called \"the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar.\" This is a good instance of how the use of the same names, though in different order, clung to a tribe or family through long periods.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house, to wit, of Tola: they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The six sons of Tola given here are stated to be the six heads of the house at the time of the census of David (2 Samuel 24:1-17). The verse further states that the Tolaites had grown to number at that time twenty-two thousand six hundred, and as this fact is not stated elsewhere, it is pretty clear proof that the compiler had other sources of information in addition to those possessed by us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah; Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Five. The name of Izrahiah's sons count up only four; but if, with four of Kennicott's manuscripts, the words, and the sons of Izrahiah, should be omitted, the five will count right for sons of Uzzi, and the little clause beginning this verse will correspond exactly with that beginning ver. 2. The Syriac, however, does not omit \"and the sons of Izrahiah;\" but alters the numeral \"five\" to \"four.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with them, by their generations, after the house of their fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty thousand men: for they had many wives and sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - The meaning of these verses, especially of the former of them, is not quite evident. This seems to say that as the Tolaites were in David's time twenty-two thousand six hundred, so the Uzzites taken from among them (or the \"sons of Izrahiah,\" as the case may be) numbered thirty-six thousand additional. But were not the Uzzites included in the Tolaites? and did not the figure thirty-six thousand embrace the accumulated numbers, whilst the balance of fifty-one thousand necessary to make up the eighty-seven thousand of ver. 5, was drawn from all the other branches of the Issachar tribe? This is not the view, however, generally taken, and if the numbers of vers. 2 and 4 are distinct, the balance needful for ver. 5 will, of course, be twenty-eight thousand four hundred. It cannot be denied that this view is favoured by the special description applied to these Uzzites, or Izrahiahites, as bands of soldiers for war; their disposition and their training constituting possibly the reason of their being singled out for further description from among the sons of Tola. The statement of the total number of the tribe of Issachar in David's time is wonderfully corroborated by the two censuses of Moses - Numbers 1:28, 29, fifty-four thousand four hundred; and Numbers 26:23-25, sixty-four thousand three hundred. The total of Issachar, four score and seven thousand, is a good proportion of the aggregate total of all the tribes, given (2 Samuel 24:8, 9) as eight hundred thousand. Grove, however, adds all the above numbers, and makes thereby Issachar's total (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:901 b) one hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred, which seems disfavoured by the numbers at the second census of Moses. At the time of this census Issachar came third of all the tribes, only Judah and Dan taking precedence. The bands of soldiers for war. This expression culminates in the word (גְדוּדִים) \"bands,\" which is applied (Genesis 49:19) to Gad, and almost invariably to the irregular but special bodies of fighting men of the nations round (Authorized Version, 1 Chronicles 12:23 is incorrect, the Hebrew word being different). The examples are too numerous to quote, but some of the more important instances are 2 Kings 6:23; 2 Kings 13:20; 2 Kings 24:2; Hosea 6:9; Hosea 7:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their brethren among all the families of Issachar were valiant men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and seven thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three. We have four passages for our authorities as to the sons of Benjamin, and it is not altogether easy to bring them into verbal harmony. They are Genesis 46:21; Numbers 26:38-41; the present passage; and ch. 8. Our present passage mentions three sons, as though they were all, and immediately proceeds to their posterity. The list in Genesis mentions ten, of whom, however, we know (Numbers 26:40; 1 Chronicles 8:3, 4) that three, Naaman, Ard, and Gem, were grandsons, being sons of Bela, under which circumstances the order in which the two former stand in Genesis is remarkable. Again, while Becher is given as the second son in both Genesis and our present place, he is not mentioned in Numbers 26:38-41 and in 1 Chronicles 8:1. Ashbel, who in Genesis is given as the third, is expressly called the second son. Among the Ephraimites, however (Numbers 26:35), a Becher, with his descendants the Bachrites, is mentioned, and it is not improbable that, by marriage, the family were at that time, for manifest reasons of inheritance and possession, reckoned in this tribe, though by blood of the tribe of Benjamin. This subject is skilfully discussed by Lord A. C. Hervey (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:175). Lastly, Jediael of this passage and ver. 10 is not found in Genesis, in Numbers, or in our ch. 8. This name seems to have superseded in our passage the name Ashbel in Genesis, though it is impossible to speak certainly. It cannot be supposed to designate the same person, but rather a descendant in the same branch, whose family had come to importance \"in the days of David.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth, and Iri, five; heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of valour; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And the sons of Bela.

These two, called (Numbers 36:39) \"Shupham and Hupham,\" and 1 Chronicles 8:5 \"Shephuphan and Huram,\" are mentioned (Genesis 46:21) as among those who went down with Jacob into Egypt, are called \"Muppim and Huppim,\" and are described as \"sons of Benjamin.\" They are here described as sons of Iri, or Ir, which would make them great-grandsons of Benjamin, a thing impossible. Hushim, the sons of Aher. Nothing can be said with confidence of either of these names. The Hushim of Genesis 46:23 (called Shuham, Numbers 26:42) are expressly given as a family of Dan, while the Hushim of 1 Chronicles 8:8, 11, is manifestly the name, not of a family, but of an individual, and that a woman. Bertheau takes the opportunity of urging, in connection with this name, that Dan is not entirely omitted in our work of Chronicles! But his foundation is surely far too slender to build upon. Bertheau and Zockler (in Lange, 'Alt. Test.') would translate אַחֵר \"another,\" or \"the other,\" instancing not very pertinently, Ezra 2:31, and referring the allusion to Dan. He also thinks that this is corroborated by the expression, \"the sons of Bilhah,\" in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Naphtali; Jahziel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shallum, the sons of Bilhah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The sons of Naphtali. In an order quite different from the otherwise parallel passages (Genesis 46:24; Numbers 26:48-50), the tribe of Naphtali is taken. Naphtali was the second son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah, and in order of birth the fifth sen of Jacob, and was of course more closely allied to Dan, Ephraim, and Benjamin. The family was distinguished for its spirit throughout its history. At the Sinai census it numbered fifty-three thousand four hundred fighting men (Numbers 1:42, 43); but at the close of the wanderings through the wilderness its numbers had become only forty-five thousand four hundred. Its territory in the north, largely mountainous, bounded by Asher, Zebulun, and Manasseh, was some of the finest, and covered the district afterwards called Galilee, \"the cradle of the Christian faith, the native place of most of the apostles, and the home of our Lord\" (Grove). The slight difference in the spelling of Jahziel in Genesis, and of Shallum in Numbers, may be noticed. The following are interesting references to Naphtali in one or another portion of its history: - Deuteronomy 33:23; Joshua 20:7; Joshua 21:32; Judges 1:33; Judges 5:18; 1 Chronicles 27:19; Ezekiel 48:3, 4, 34; Matthew 4:15; Revelation 7:6. It played a considerable and prominent part also in the conflicts with Titus and Vespasian, when the days of Jerusalem were numbered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bare: (but his concubine the Aramitess bare Machir the father of Gilead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The sons of Manasseh. The tribe of Manasseh has been partly treated of in 1 Chronicles 5:23-26, viz. those of the tribe who inhabited Gilead and Bashan. Here those who inhabited this side Jordan are treated cf. And it is very difficult to give any coherent account of the differences of this passage when compared with Numbers 26:28-34 and Joshua 17:1-4. In these places six families, or heads of families, are noted to only two, or at most three here, viz. Askriel, Shemida, and perhaps Abiezer (iq. Jeezer, Numbers 26:30; comp. with Joshua 17:2). The opening clause of this verse also is unmanageable as it stands. One way of reducing it to coherence would be to Supply the words \"his wife\" between whom and bars, the similarity of the Hebrew letters of which to those of the Hebrew for \"whom\" might possibly account for the loss of it. The parenthesis about the concubine would then read with emphasis. But there is not the slightest reason to suppose there was such a wife. Another way would be to read the concubine as the mother of Ashriel, and prefix a conjunction, and, to the second \"bare;\" i.e. and she bare, or, she bare also Machir.\" But it seems pretty plain from Numbers and Joshua that Ashriel was not strictly a son, but only descendant of Manasseh; and, further, the irresistible impression is that Machir was the only son, strictly speaking (see especially Genesis 50:23). The position of Ashriel in our present passage, first, is also very unsatisfactory in face of Genesis 50:23 and the other references already given.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Machir took to wife the sister of Huppim and Shuppim, whose sister's name was Maachah;) and the name of the second was Zelophehad: and Zelophehad had daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Maachah. Of this Maachah, one among tea of the same name, nothing else is known. The Peshito Syriac makes her the mother instead of wife of Machir. The distinct mention of the marriage of a Manassite to a Benjamite woman is to be noticed. Zelophehad. The meaning of the preceding words, and the name of the second, is unintelligible. Zelophehad was son of Hephen, who was (through Gilead and Maehir) great-grandson of Manasseh (Joshua 17:3). The number and names and wise appeal and success of the daughters here spoken of, are given in Joshua 17:3-6; Numbers 26:33; Numbers 27:1-11; Numbers 36:5-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Maachah the wife of Machir bare a son, and she called his name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his sons were Ulam and Rakem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Ulam; Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Bedan. While all the names of the preceding verse are strange to us, this name excites much interest, as possibly to be identified with the Bedan (1 Samuel 12:11) who is placed after Jerubbaal (i.q. Gideon), and before Jephthah and Samuel. Who in the Book of Judges is to answer to this Bedan of the Book of Samuel it is impossible to say. See Bishop Cotton's excellent short article (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' L 177). These were the sons of Gilead (see ver. 14). The name Gilead surpassed the name Machir, and even rivalled that of Manasseh itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his sister Hammoleketh bare Ishod, and Abiezer, and Mahalah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Abiezer. He is the nephew, then, of Gilead, and grandson of Machir. Gideon sprang from him (Judges 6:11; Judges 8:32). The name of the mother, Hammoleketh, is compounded of the article and Moleketh, or Meleketh, a Chaldee form, found several times in the Book of Jeremiah, of the word for \"queen.\" Of Ishod and Mahalah nothing is known, but the latter name is identical with Mahlah, one of the five daughters of Zelophehad.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Shemida were, Ahian, and Shechem, and Likhi, and Aniam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Shemidah, Joshua 17:2 tells us that the descendants of Shemida obtained their inheritance among the male children of Manasseh; and Numbers 26:32 places him in the Gilead family. Of Ahian, Likhi, Aniam, nothing else is known. Shechem. If this name is rightly placed under Shemi-dab, it must be concluded from Joshua 17:2 and Numbers 26:31 that it is a different Shechem from the one there found. This latter was also a Manassite, belonged to the family of Gilead, and was head of a family named Shechemites after him. His descendants are spoken of as the \"sons of Shechem\" in the above passage of Joshua.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Ephraim; Shuthelah, and Bered his son, and Tahath his son, and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-27. - The chief difficulty of this passage lies in reconciling the points of chronology which it forces to the surface. Vers. 20, 21, purport to contain the line of descent from Ephraim through his son Shu-thelah to the seventh generation, viz. to another Shuthelah. The remaining two names, Ezer and Elead, may perhaps be two brothers of the first Shuthelah, i.e. own sons of Ephraim. If it be so, these two must not be supposed to correspond with Becher and Tahan, called \"sons of Ephraim\" in Numbers 26:35; for it is evident that they were generations succeeding Shuthelah. Now, Ephraim was born in Egypt (Genesis 46:20), so that, on the above showing, the actual sons of Ephraim must have made some incursion from Egypt into the territories of the settled or possibly aboriginal inhabitants of Gath, and met the fate over which Ephraim so mourned. Such excursions on the part of the Israelites out of Egypt have very little collateral evidence. But there would seem to be no impossibility in the matter, considering Genesis 50:13-23. Next, vers. 23-27 seem to say that in his sorrow Ephraim has another son, whom he names Beriah, and of whose line in the ninth descent comes Joshua, the son of Nun. This also is very doubtful. It may very possibly be that the parenthesis continues to the end of ver. 23 or 24, and that vers. 25-27 carry on the generations from ver. 21. Meantime welcome light breaks in at the stage (ver. 26) at which Ammihud and Elishama are mentioned. For we find these immediate ancestors of the great Joshua repeatedly mentioned at the period of the Exodus (Numbers 1:10; Numbers 2:18; Numbers 7:48, etc.); yet none of these places assist us to say that he did or did not come through Beriah. It is impossible to solve with any certainty the involved question of chronology and genealogy presented by this section. The passage is evidently mutilated and corrupt, though vindicating a high antiquity. Avery original presentation of the whole section, as ingenious as it is conjectural, by Lord A.C. Hervey, may be found in the art. \"Shuthclah,\" Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1305. It is well worthy of attention that a great point is made in bringing Joshua to the place of the eighth generation from Joseph, in near analogy with the numbers in so many other known cases, of the generations that intervened from the descent into Egypt to the entrance into Canaan. There also may be found the most and best that can be said against the literal reading of what is here written respecting the men of Gath and the cattle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Because they - i.e, the men of Ephraim - came down to take away their cattle. This certainly may be translated, when they (i.e. the men of Gath) came down (i.e. into Goshen) to plunder their cattle (i.e. the cattle of Ephraim).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren came to comfort him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bare a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(And his daughter was Sherah, who built Bethhoron the nether, and the upper, and Uzzensherah.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - His daughter. If the literal interpretation of this whole section be accepted, according to which both Ephraim and Beriah must have passed their lifetime in Egypt, the \"daughter,\" strictly so called, of either the one or the other could not have been the founder of the places here mentioned. The word \"daughter\" must, therefore, represent simply a female descendant. (For other references to Beth-heron, see Joshua 10:10, 11; Joshua 16:3, 5; Joshua 18:13, 14; Joshua 21:20-22.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rephah was his son, also Resheph, and Telah his son, and Tahan his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Of the names Rephah and Resheph nothing else is known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLaadan his son, Ammihud his son, Elishama his son,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNon his son, Jehoshua his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Non.

This place is probably the same with the Naarath or Naarah of Joshua 16:7; though here it is said to be an eastward limit, and there its description might rather seem that of a southward limit. Gaza. This name can scarcely designate the well-known Gaza, assigned to Judah (Joshua 15:47; Judges 1:18), but so largely the prey of the Philistines (Judges 3:3; Judges 16:21; 1 Samuel 6:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the borders of the children of Manasseh, Bethshean and her towns, Taanach and her towns, Megiddo and her towns, Dor and her towns.

Bethshean was on the west of Jordan, and was within the borders of Issachar (Joshua 17:11-13; 1 Kings 4:11, 12). Dor was within the borders of Asher (Joshua 11:1, 2; Joshua 12:23; Joshua 17:11; Judges 1:27, 28). Taanach. This place also lay within the borders of Issachar or Asher (Joshua 17:11, 12; Joshua 21:25; Judges 5:19). Megiddo. This place is constantly coupled with the preceding. It lay on the south of the plain of Esdraelon (Joshua 12:21; Joshua 17:12; Judges 1:27; 1 Kings 4:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Asher; Imnah, and Isuah, and Ishuai, and Beriah, and Serah their sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The same four sons and one daughter of Asher are found in Genesis 46:17; but the name of the second son is wanting to the list of families descended from Asher of Numbers 26:44-47, and the name of the daughter is given by itself, and not as furnishing a family.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel, who is the father of Birzavith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - These two grandsons are also found in the above lists of both Genesis and Numbers; but nothing is found there to explain the name Birzavith, which the Keri spells with yod, the Kethiv with van. With the former spelling its signification would be the \"well of olives,\" and would point to its being the name of a place rather than of a person, and, as some think, that person a woman (Gesenius, 'Thes.,' 239). (For instances of the expression \"father\" of a place, see 1 Chronicles 2:51, 52; 1 Chronicles 4:4, 5.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Heber begat Japhlet, and Shomer, and Hotham, and Shua their sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Japhlet. This son of Heber, not otherwise known, cannot be identified with the \"Japhletite' of Joshua 16:3 (himself an enigma), on the south boundary of Ephraim, between the nether Beth-heron and Ataroth. Shomer; i.q. Shamer of ver. 34.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Japhlet; Pasach, and Bimhal, and Ashvath. These are the children of Japhlet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Nothing, except what follows in the next verses, is known of the three sons of Japhlet given in this verse. In them we reach the fourth generation from Asher. The generations then travel forward through Helem, presumably a third brother of Japhlet, passing the sons of Shamer, or Shomer, presumably Japhlet's second brother.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Shamer; Ahi, and Rohgah, Jehubbah, and Aram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - Ahi. It seems impossible to decide with certainty whether this is the name of a person or whether, with the vau, which otherwise begins the next word, it should not be translated \"his brother,\" ie. the brother of Japhlet. In ver. 32 the names of three brothers are given, sons of Heber, viz. Japhlet, Shomer, and Hotham. Now, the name Helem, in ver. 35, is supposed to point to this Hotham. If it be so, it would so far be an argument that Ahi, in ver. 34, should be translated \"his brother,\" in correspondence with the undoubted \"his brother\" of ver. 35. Of no one of the names in these verses is anything further known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of his brother Helem; Zophah, and Imna, and Shelesh, and Amal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Zophah; Suah, and Harnepher, and Shual, and Beri, and Imrah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36-38. - Vers. 36 and 37 purport to give us eleven sons of Zophah, son of Helem, and grandson of Heber, and these bring us to the sixth generation from Asher; and again (ver. 38), we reach the seventh in descent from Asher, in the three sons of Jether, or Ithran, the tenth son of Zophah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBezer, and Hod, and Shamma, and Shilshah, and Ithran, and Beera.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Jether; Jephunneh, and Pispah, and Ara.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Ulla; Arah, and Haniel, and Rezia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Ulla. Whether in this verse we get to the eighth generation depends on who may be meant by Ulla. It is impossible to answer the question. The suggestion has been made that the name may, by some great error of copyists, stand for either Zophah's last son Beera, or, by happier conjecture, Jether's last son, Ara. But neither professes to be anything better than mere conjecture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles7:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these were the children of Asher, heads of their father's house, choice and mighty men of valour, chief of the princes. And the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Twenty and six thousand. The number of Asherites, \"of twenty years old and upwards, able to go forth to war,\" given in Numbers 1:40, 41, was forty-one thousand five hundred. Forty years later (Numbers 26:44-47; comp. ver. 2) the number was fifty-three thousand four hundred. But it is supposed that the twenty-six thousand of this verse may refer only to a portion of the tribe, i.e. to the large and distinguished family of Heber. It is to be noticed that the name of the tribe of Asher is not found in the list of the \"chief rulers\" lower down in this book (1 Chronicles 27:16-22). The tone also in which reference is made to Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun coming to Jerusalem to Hezekiah's Passover (2 Chronicles 30:11) is very noticeable. This tribe, with Simeon, gave no judge to the nation, and of all the tribes west of the Jordan they stand by themselves in this respect. There is an ancient legend that the parents of St. Paul lived within the territories of Asher, at the place called Ahlab in Judges 1:31, otherwise Giscala, or Gush Chaleb. Against the uncertainty of the legend we may gratefully remember the certainty of the history of the \"Anna,... daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser\" (Luke 2:36).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Chr.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - These verses give five sons to Benjamin.

Genesis (Genesis 44:41) only finds us clearly three of them, and these in very different order, viz. Gera, Naaman, and Arel; and Numbers (Numbers 26:39, 40) finds us only three, viz. Ard, Naaman, and Shupham. Yet our Huram may correspond with Hupham, and then the four pairs of names - Shephuphan and Huram, Shupham and Hupham, Shuppim and Huppim, and Muppim and Huppim - may be interpreted as designating one and the same couple of persons. The recurrence of the name Gera in ver. 5, so close upon the same name in ver. 3, would of course be more remarkable, and point inevitably to the disordered state of the text, if it were necessary to suppose that these nine persons were really brothers, as well as called sons of Bela.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Ehud. We are brought to a halt again by the sudden introduction of this name. Even if it stand for Abihud (ver. 3) or for Ahoah (ver. 4), why is it changed in so short an interval? It is impossible to establish order in these verses except by most gratuitous conjecture. But it may be supposed that the verses say that Ehud's people once belonged to Manahath, that the heads of them removed them to Geba (Joshua 18:24), and that he himself (query, Ehud? but commonly read Gera) removed them, and also Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera (which look very much like the Naaman, Ahoah, and Gera of vers. 4, 5); and finally that after the removing \"he\" had two fresh sons, Uzza and Ahihud.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat Uzza, and Ahihud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Shaharaim. It has been proposed, in the utter obscurity here, to add this name as a third to Uzza and Ahihud. This may be a way out, but if so, instead of repeating \"and Shaharaim,\" it might be more natural to keep the former enigmatic nominative and object to begat, whether Ehud or Gera. There can be little doubt that a copyist's error has given us them (אֹתָם) in place of אֶת, in the latter part of this verse, before the names of the wives. The sentence then would translate, \"after his sending away [whether by divorce or not] Hushim and Baara his wives.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - These verses give seven unknown sons of Ehud, Gera, or Shaharaim, as the case may be, by the wife Hodesh, whom one would have been glad to identify with Baara, and two unknown sons of the wife Hushim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma.

Unsubdued by them (Judges 1:34-36), the Ephraimites possessed it awhile (1 Chronicles 6:47-49), until it came to be more like the common property or care of Benjamin and Judah, situated as it was on their boundary line (1 Samuel 14:31; 2 Chronicles 11:10; 2 Chronicles 28:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hezeki, and Heber,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIshmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elienai, and Zilthai, and Eliel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath, the sons of Shimhi;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ishpan, and Heber, and Eliel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hananiah, and Elam, and Antothijah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Iphedeiah, and Penuel, the sons of Shashak;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shamsherai, and Shehariah, and Athaliah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief men.

And apparently the same account, minus some of its deficiencies, is repeated in the next chapter, vers. 35-44. The two may be taken together here, and the latter will help the interpretation of the former. Verse 29. - The father - i.e, the chief - of Gibeon. (For Gibeon, see Joshua 9:3, 7-18; Joshua 10:2; Joshua 11:19; Nehemiah 7:25; Nehemiah 3:7.) The father of Gibeon (1 Chronicles 9:35) was Jehiel (יְעִיאֵל; Chethiv spells with vau; not יְחִיאֵל, 1 Chronicles 15:24). Of Jehiel by this name we do not elsewhere read. And even if it were on other grounds possible to identify the person with the Abiel of 1 Samuel 9:1 and 1 Sam 14:51, it is not possible to identify the names. Compare the similar remarkable omission of the name of the \"father of Gibea\" (1 Chronicles 2:49), an omission to be filled very possibly by this same name Jehiel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - These verses contain the names of eight sons of Jehiel instead of the ten of 1 Chronicles 9:36, 37. Both of the missing names, however (viz. Ner after Baal, and Mikloth after Zacher), are introduced in verses immediately succeeding, where their sons are spoken cf. One name, Zacher, also is spelt as Zechariah in 1 Chronicles 9:37. Both these passages agree in representing Net as the grandfather of Saul. Not so the two passages in Samuel (1 Samuel 9:1; 1 Samuel 14:51), the first of which writes Abiel in the place of the grandfather instead of great-grandfather, which, however, need occasion little difficulty; and the second of which would certainly allow Ner to be grandfather to Saul, but seems to call him uncle. Even then, if we accept what the passage allows, it is somewhat remarkable that in the next verse Ner should be signalized as father of Abner rather than of Kish - a difficulty, however, much less considerable if we accept the suggestion (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.) to translate ver. 51 thus, by the substitution of the word \"sons\" for \"son:\" \"And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel.\" It must be remembered at the same time that this is not equivalent to saying that they were necessarily brothers, but only descendants of the chief of the family, of the Demarch or Phylarch under mention in the genealogy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Mikloth begat Shimeah.

Esh-baal; the same with Ishbo-sheth (2 Samuel 2:8; 2 Samuel 3:7-14; 2 Samuel 4:4-12). Merib-baal; the same with Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 9:12).

Ulam is twelfth from Saul, while his \"sons and sons' sons\" (ver. 40) are spoken cf. The time of Hezekiah must be reached, therefore, who was thirteenth from David.

The Hebrew verb (חִתְיַחְשׂי) is sufficiently satisfied by the rendering were enrolled, or were registered. The book of the kings of Israel and Judah. The book referred to is often styled \"The book of the kings of Israel\" (2 Chronicles 20:34; 2 Chronicles 33:18); and it is more probable that that is the intended title here, and that the words should follow thus: And Judah were carried captive to Babylon because of their transgressions. This the Masoretic accenting dictates, though the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Luther have our Authorized Version order. The inconvenience to certain of not being able to find their registers is alluded to in Ezra 2:59.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions, in their cities. Authorities are very divided as to whether this expression describes inhabitants of the land before the Captivity or subsequent to it. Almost all the older authorities, and Keil amongst those of more modern date, take the former position; Movers, Bertheau, and others take the latter, as also Canon Rawlinson ('Speaker's Commentary,' 3:157, 211). It must be admitted that there is some obscurity, and which accounts for the contrariety of opinion. But obscurity and contrariety notwithstanding, a comparison of vers. 2 and 3 with Nehemiah 11:1-4: produces two impressions almost irresistible, viz. that the difficulty is occasioned by some comparatively slight corruption or mutilation in our ver. 2; and that, whatever the reference is in Nehemiah 11:1-4 (and there is no ambiguity there), that it is in the present passage. The fourfold classification intends the Israel people (Isaiah 24:2; Hosea 4:9), the priests, the Levites, the Nethinims, i.e. those given as helpers of the priests, bond-men of the temple (Numbers 8:18, 19; Numbers 31:47; Ezra 2:40-48; Ezra 8:17, 20). Not before the time of the return does the name Nethinim seem to have crystallized upon this class of helpers, the explanation of which may possibly be that their numbers and their services then became so much more necessary. To this classification is added in Nehemiah 11:3, \"And the children of Solomon's servants\" (Ezra 2:55).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh.

The origin of the names of these three priest families is found in 1 Chronicles 24:7, 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - This list resembles much more closely that of Nehemiah 11:11-14. The one thousand and seven hundred and three score of this passage is not reached by five hundred and sixty-eight, when the numbers of Nehemiah 11:12-14 are all added together. The name Azariah (in Nehemiah appearing, probably simply by copyist's error, as Seraiah), here described as ruler of the house of God, probably points to the high priest Eliashib, who held that office in the time of Nehemiah, and was descended from Seraiah (1 Chronicles 6:14). The ins and outs of the lists of these verses confirm the supposition that the way in which differences in the other lists occur are easily to be accounted for, in one compiler having selected some of the names of the whole line of genealogy, and another others, though in each several case according to reasons often unknown by us. Thus, between Jeroham and Pashur the table of Nehemiah supplies three additional links in the names Pelaliah, Amzi, Zechariah; while in our very next verse, for the three between Maasiai (Amashai) and Meshillemith, Nehemiah has only two names, and neither of those two (Azareel, Ahasai) the same as found here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-16. - The corresponding account of these Levites (Nehemiah 11:15-18) has some additional details - as, for instance, that the number of \"the Levites in the holy city were two hundred four score and four;\" that two \"of the chief of the Levites, Shabbethai and Jozabad,\" not given here, \"had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God;\" that \"Mattaniah... was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer;\" and that Bakbukiah (hero called Bakbakkar) was \"the second among his brethren.\" Hashabiah is also stated to be \"the son of Bunni.\" The Netophathites. The town Netophah was either locally near Bethlehem, or in some way closely related to it (1 Chronicles 2:54; Nehemiah 7:26). It is not directly mentioned, though existing long before, till the accounts of those who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:22). Interesting facts, respecting its people are found in 1 Chronicles 27:13, 15; Nehemiah 12:28. Though our Authorized Version has the name here in the plural, it is not so in the Hebrew, nor is it there accompanied by the article.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The porters here are those who had charge of the entrances to the sanctuary. The word employed (שֹׁעֵר) is used, however, generally of gate or door keepers (2 Samuel 17:26; John 10:3; Mark 13:3, 4; John 18:16). Their number, stated in ver. 22 as two hundred and twelve, is probably corrected in Nehemiah 11:19 to one hundred and seventy-two, made up of twenty-four for every week (1 Chronicles 26:17, 18), \"entering on the sabbath\" upon their work (2 Kings 11:5; 2 Chronicles 23:4), in rotation for seven weeks, and the four \"chief warders.\" For the five porters here mentioned there are only two mentioned in Nehemiah 11:19, and neither of those Shallum, the chief.

Marked as a different person from the former of the same name, by the description son of Kore, etc. The pedigree here given enables us to identify the person intended as Shelemiah or Moshelemiah.

These are descriptions of \"service,\" not synonymous with those of vers. 17 and 18, where the words וְהַשְּׁעַרִים and בְּשַׁעַר are found, in place of those used here, viz. שֹׁמְרֵי הַסִּפִים לָאֹחֶל and שֹׁמְרֵי הַמָּבוא. They designate the care of the inner entrances of the sacred building. Their fathers were keepers of the entrance to the tabernacle, as these to the inner doors (margin, \"thresholds\") of the temple.

It is to be noticed that the compiler of Chronicles uses elsewhere, as here, the \"aforetime\" name of the prophet, according to 1 Samuel 9:9. Note in this verse the linking together of the names of David and Samuel, to the ignoring of that of Saul. In their set office. Keil would translate, \"Upon their fidelity, i.e. because they had been found faithful.\" But our margin translates happily, \"in their trust,\" which will include, in part, the thought of Keil, and will suit our ver. 26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-26. - (See above and 1 Chronicles 26:12-19.)

The word \"free\" is surely sufficiently explained by the following sentence, in connection with Ezra 7:24; Nehemiah 11:23. It is more doubtful whether the expression, \"these singers,\" refers to names, which now should have been inserted but are lost, or possibly to ver. 16, ante; the idiom would prefer the former. They were employed in that work day and night; literally, for by day and by night on them, in the work.
