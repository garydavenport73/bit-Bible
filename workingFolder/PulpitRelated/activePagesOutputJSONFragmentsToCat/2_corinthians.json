The \"beseech\" is here right (deomai). The \"you\" is not in the Greek, but is rightly supplied. It rests with them to avert the necessity of personal severity, and he entreats them to do so (comp. 2 Corinthians 13:2, 10; 1 Corinthians 4:21). Against some. He leaves these undefined till the vehement outburst of 2 Corinthians 11:13, 14. As if we walked according to the flesh (see note on 2 Corinthians 5:16). To say this of St. Paul was to charge him with being insincere and not disinterested.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - We walk in the flesh. St. Paul does not disclaim the possession of human infirmities, but maintains that such trials and temptations were not the guiding force of his life. We do not war after the flesh. His campaigns (Luke 3:14) were fought with spiritual weapons. The metaphor is a constant one with St. Paul (2 Corinthians 2:14-16; 1 Corinthians 9:26; Ephesians 6:10-17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Weapons (see 2 Corinthians 6:7; Romans 6:13). Not carnal. He did not rely on the mere \"arm of flesh,\" or on earthly sword or panoply. Mighty through God; literally, powerful for God; i.e. eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) powerful for the cause of God, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) powerful in his estimate. To the pulling down of strongholds. The word for \"pulling down,\" which implies the entire clearance of an obstacle, is only found in the New Testament in this Epistle (vers. 4, 8; 2 Corinthians 13:10). The word for \"strongholds\" is found here alone. These \"fortresses\" were the opposition aroused by factious and hostile partisans, and he hoped to subdue them by the strong exercise of apostolic authority (l Corinthians 4:21; 5:1-5). Dean Stanley suggests a reminiscence of the hundred and twenty Cilician fortresses pulled down by Pompey; but I think that these general allusions are often pressed too far.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCasting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Casting down. This agrees with \"we\" understood, not with \"weapons.\" Imaginations; rather, disputations, or reasonings. Every high thing that exalteth itself; rather, every height that is exalted. Against the knowledge of God (see 1 Corinthians 15:34). There, however, we have passive ignorance, here active opposition. Bringing into captivity. When the fortresses are razed, their defenders will be taken prisoners, but for a beneficent end. Every thought. Even intellectual result. The word (noema) is not common in the New Testament. It occurs five times in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 2:11; 2 Corinthians 3:14; 2 Corinthians 4:4; 2 Corinthians 10:5; 2 Corinthians 11:3), but elsewhere only in Philippians 4:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Being in a readiness; i.e. being quite prepared. My sternness of purpose is ready, but my hope is that it may not be called into action. To revenge; rather, to do justice upon. In any case, in this infliction of justice, whatever form it might take, he would only be an agent of God (Romans 12:19). When your obedience is fulfilled. St. Paul is confident that he will overcome the mazes of those opposed to him, and win them to Christ's obedience; but if there were any who should obstinately refuse to submit, they must be reduced to submission by action, not by words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? Like many clauses in this section, the words are capable of different interpretations. They might mean,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) as in the Authorized Version, \"Do you judge by mere externals?\" or,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"You judge by things which merely lie on the surface!\" or,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"Consider the personal aspect of the question.\" The Authorized Version is probably right (comp. John 7:24). If any man. Perhaps alluding to some party ringleader. That he is Christ's. If a man holds this in an exclusive and partisan sense (1 Corinthians 1:12). Some manuscripts (D, E, F, G) read, \"a slave of Christ.\" Of himself. The true reading is probably ἐφ, not ἀφ, but in either ease the meaning is, \"by his own fair judgment.\" Even so are we Christ's. In a true and real sense, not by external knowledge and connection (which he has already disclaimed), but by inward union. This he proceeds to prove by the fact that he was the founder of their Church (vers. 13-18); that he had always acted with absolute disinterestedness (2 Corinthians 11:1-15); that he had lived a life of toil and suffering (2 Corinthians 11:21-33), and that he had received special revelations from God (2 Corinthians 12:1-6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-11. - Assertion of his intentions. Verse 8. - Should boast. In this section St. Paul is thoroughly haunted by this word. The fact that a word could thus possess and dominate over his style and imagination shows how deeply he was moved. The Corinthian Church, with its inflated factions and their fuglemen, recked with beasting, and St. Paul is driven, with utter distaste, to adopt in self-defence language which, to the uncandid and indiscriminating, might seem to wear the same aspect. The word, which is unfrequent in other Epistles, occurs eighteen times in these chapters alone. Other haunting words are \"tolerate,\" \"bear with\" (2 Corinthians 11:l, 4, 19, 20), and \"senseless,\" \"fool\" (2 Corinthians 11:16, 19; 2 Corinthians 12:6, 11); see note on 2 Corinthians 1:3. Somewhat more; something more abundantly. For edification, and not for your destruction; for building you up, not pulling you down. The word kathairesin is from the same root as the verb in ver. 5. I should not be ashamed; rather, I shall not be ashamed. No shame shall ever accrue to me from my \"boast\" being proved false.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - By letters; rather, by the letters. He had certainly addressed two letters to them (1 Corinthians 5:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Say they; literally, says he. The phrase may, indeed, imply \"it is said\" (on dit); but it may refer to one main critic and opponent (comp. vers. 7, 11). Perhaps it would have been wiser and kinder if no one had reported to St. Paul all these subterranean calumnies and innuendoes. Weighty and strong. This could not be denied, considering the immense effect which had been produced by his first letter (2 Corinthians 7:7). His bodily presence is weak. This is usually taken to mean that St. Paul's personal appearance was unprepossessing (Galatians 4:1). This, indeed, we should infer from many other passages (1 Corinthians 2:34; Galatians 4:13, 14), and as a natural result of his \"stake in the flesh.\" It is, too, the consistent though late tradition respecting him (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:628). Here, however, the words may mean no more than that \"he adds nothing to his cause by being present in person, since he shows vacillation and want of energy.\" Contemptible; rather, despised (see 1 Corinthians 2:3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Such a one. A formula used to avoid mentioning a special name (see note on 2 Corinthians 2:7). Such will we be; rather, such are we. The verb is not expressed, but it would have been if the future tense had been intended. In this verse St. Paul is not saying what he would do hereafter, but is rebutting with calmness and dignity the false charge that he was in any way different when absent from what he was when present.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - We dare not. They are in this respect of self-praise much bolder than I. Make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves; literally, judge ourselves among or judge ourselves with. There is a play on the words, like the Latin, inferre or conferre, or the German, zurechnen oder gleichrechnen. That commend themselves. The verb rendered \"commend\" is that from which is derived \"the commendatory letters\" (2 Corinthians 3:1) at the arrogant and intrusive use of which he had glanced already. St. Paul is once more rebutting the charge of self-commendation (2 Corinthians 4:2; 2 Corinthians 5:12; 2 Corinthians 6:11). But they measuring themselves...are not wise. The clause is difficult; forNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to compare ourselves with others in order to learn what we can and cannot do is usually accounted wise;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) some manuscripts and editions, omitting οὐ συνιοῦσιν ἡμεῖς δὲ, render, \"But we ourselves (αὐτοὶ), measuring ourselves by ourselves, and comparing ourselves with ourselves, will not boast above measure;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) some, for συνιοῦσιν (they are not wise) read συνίουσιν (with ourselves, who are not wise). The reading, however, of the Authorized Version is undoubtedly right, and most probably the rendering also. The meaning is that the little cliques of factious religionists, never looking outside their own narrow circles, became inflated with a sense of importance which would have been annihilated if they had looked at higher standards. Hence they thought themselves at liberty to intrude and lay down the law and usurp a claim to infallibility which there was nothing to justify. Such conduct is the reverse of wise. It is a mixture of selfishness, Pharisaism, and conceit, and there have been abundant examples of it among religious parties in all ages. St. Paul, on the other hand, keeps within his own measure, because he has learnt to adopt larger and loftier standards.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Will not boast of things without our measure. This might be rendered, \"will not indulge in these immeasurable boastings;\" but ver. 15 points to the sense, \"we will not glory beyond our measure.\" Of the rule; i.e. of the measuring line. I will keep to the province and limit which God has assigned to me in my proper mea- sure. St. Paul declines the favourite office of being \"other people's bishop ἀλλοτριοεπίσκοπος)\" (1 Peter 4:15). Hath distributed; rather, apportioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As though we reached not unto you. In including you within the reach of our measuring line, we are guilty neither of presumption nor of intrusion. Your Church is a part of our legitimate province and range of work (Acts 18:1, 4). We are come as far as to you; rather, we anticipated others in coming to you; \"we were the first to come as far as unto you.\" To St. Paul belonged the undisputed glory of having first introduced the gospel into the regions of Macedonia and Achaia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - That is, of other men's labours. Not to thrust himself obtrusively into spheres of labour which legitimately belonged to others was a part of St. Paul's scrupulously chivalrous rule (2 Corinthians 3:10; Galatians 2:9; Romans 15:20). It contrasted with the usurping arrogance of these Jerusalem emissaries. When your faith is increased; rather, increases or grows. He delicately implies that their lack of faith prevents the extension of his labours. He could not leave in his rear an unstormed fortress of opposition to the gospel. The spread of the gospel depends on them. We shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly. The Revised Version renders it more clearly, \"We shall be magnified in you according to our province unto further abundance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - In the regions beyond you.

(comp. 1 Corinthians 4:8). You could bear; rather, ye would bear. In my folly; rather, in a little foolishness. Namely, in this foolishness of boasting. \"Fool\" and \"folly\" are here haunting words (2 Corinthians 1:16, 17, 19, 21; 2 Corinthians 12:6, 11). The article (the i.e. my folly) is omitted in א, B, D, E. Bear with me. It is better to take this as an indicative. It would be meaningless to pass from an entreaty to a command. On the other hand, \"Nay, ye do really bear with me\" was a loving and delicate admission of inch kindness as he had received from them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For. This gives the reason why they bore with him. It was due to a reciprocity of affection. I am jealous over you. The word implies both jealousy and zeal (2 Corinthians 7:7; 2 Corinthians 9:2). With a godly jealousy; literally, with a jealousy of God. My jealousy is not the poor earthly vice (Numbers 5:14; Ecclus. 9:1), but a heavenly zeal of love. For I have espoused you; rather, for I betrothed you; at your conversion. I acted as the paranymph, or \"bridegroom's friend\" (John 3:29), in bringing you to Christ, the Bridegroom. The metaphor is found alike in the Old and New Testaments (Isaiah 54:5; Ezekiel 23; Hosea 2:19; Ephesians 5:25-27). To one husband (Jeremiah 3:1; Ezekiel 16:15). Our Lord used an analogous metaphor in the parable of the king's wedding feast, the virgins, etc. That I may present you. The same word as in 2 Corinthians 4:14. The conversion of the Church was its betrothal to Christ, brought about by St. Paul as the paranymph; and, in the same capacity, at the final marriage feast, he would present their Church as a pure bride to Christ at his coming (Revelation 19:7-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I fear. Even now he would only contemplate their defection as a future dread, not as a present catastrophe. Lest by any means; lest haply (2 Corinthians 2:7; 2 Corinthians 9:4). As the serpent beguiled Eve. St. Paul merely touches on the central moral fact of the temptation and the Fall (Genesis 3:1-6). He enters into no speculation about the symbols, though, doubtless, like St. John (Revelation 12:9; Revelation 20:2), he would have identified the serpent with Satan (comp. 2 Corinthians 2:11 and Wisd. 2:23). Through his subtlety. The word means \"crafty wickedness.\" It is used in 2 Corinthians 12:16, and is found in 2 Corinthians 4:2; Luke 20:23. Your minds; literally, your thoughts (2 Corinthians 2:11). Should be corrupted (comp. Colossians 2:4-8; 1 Timothy 4:1). The simplicity. The apostles always insisted on this virtue, but especially St. Paul, in whose Epistles the word (ἁπλότης occurs seven times. That is in Christ; rather, that is towards (literally, into) Christ; as Cranmer rendered it, \"The perfect fidelity Which looks to him above.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He that cometh. Apparently an allusion to some recent and rival teacher. Another Jesus. The intruder preaches, not a different Jesus (ἕτερον) or a different gospel (comp. Galatians 1:6-8), but ostensibly the same Jesus whom St. Paul had preached. Another spirit... another gospel; rather, a different spirit (ἕτερον)... a different gospel. The Jesus preached was the same; the gospel accepted, the Spirit received, were supposed to remain unaltered. Ye might well bear with him. This is not without a touch of irony. You are all set against me; and yet the newcomer does not profess to preach to you another Jesus, or impart a different Spirit! Had he done so, you might have had some excuse (καλῶς) for listening to him. Now there is none; for it was I who first preached Jesus to you, and from me you first received the Spirit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For. It cannot be that you received this rival teacher as being so much superior to me; for, etc. I suppose. Again, like the Latin censeo or opinor, with a touch of irony. I was not a whit behind; in no respect have I come short of. The very chiefest apostles. The word used by St. Paul for \"very chiefest\" is one which, in its strangeness, marks the vehemence of his emotion. It involves an indignant sense that he had been most disparagingly compared with other apostles, as though he were hardly a genuine apostle at all. Yet he reckons himself to have done as much as the \"above exceedingly\" - or, as it might be expressed, the \"out and out,\" \"extra-super,\" or \"super-apostolic,\" apostles. There is here no reflection whatever on the twelve; he merely means that, even if any with whom he was uufavourably contrasted were \"apostles ten times over,\" he can claim to be in the front rank with them. This is no more than he has said with the utmost earnestness in 1 Corinthians 15:10; Galatians 2:6. There is no self-assertion here; but, in consequence of the evil done by his detractors, St. Paul, with an utter sense of distaste, is forced to say the simple truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Rude in speech; literally, a laic in discourse; see 2 Corinthians 10:10 and 1 Corinthians 2:13; and, for the word idiotes, a private person, and so \"one who is untrained,\" as contrasted with a professor, see the only other places where it occurs in the New Testament (Acts 4:13; 1 Corinthians 14:16, 23, 24). St. Paul did not profess to have the trained oratorical skill of Apollos. His eloquence, dependent on conviction and emotion, followed none of the rules of art. Yet not in knowledge. Spiritual knowledge was a primary requisite of an apostle, and St. Paul did claim to possess this (Ephesians 3:3, 4). We have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things. This would be an appeal to the transparent openness and sincerity of all his dealings, as in 2 Corinthians 4:20 and 2 Cor 12:12; but the best reading seems to be the active participle, phanerosantes (א, B, F, G), not the passive, phanerothentes. The rendering will then be, In everything making it (my knowledge) manifest among all men towards you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Have I? literally, or have I? An ironical exception to his manifestation of knowledge; \"unless you think that I committed a sin in refusing to accept maintenance at your hands.\" It is clear that even this noble generosity had been made the ground for a charge against the apostle. \"If he had not been conscious,\" they said, \"that he has no real claims, he would not have preached for nothing, when he had a perfect right to be supported by his converts\" (1 Corinthians 9:1-15). Abasing myself. The trade of tentmaker was despised, tedious, and mechanical, and it did not suffice to provide even for Paul's small needs (Acts 18:3; Acts 20:34). That ye might be exalted; namely, by spiritual gifts (Ephesians 2:4-6). The gospel... freely. Some of them would feel the vast contrast between the words. The gospel was the most precious gift of God, and they had got it for nothing. Compare the fine lines of Lowell -NEWLINENEWLINE\"For a cap and bells our lives we pay,NEWLINEBubbles we earn with our whole soul's tasking;NEWLINETis only God who is given away,NEWLINETis only heaven may be had for the asking.\" To be a free and unpaid missionary was St. Paul's pride (2 Corinthians 12:14; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9; Acts 20:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I robbed; literally, I ravaged, or plundered. The intensity of St. Paul's feelings, smarting under base calumny and ingratitude, reveals itself by the passionate expression which he here uses. Other Churches. The only Church of which we know as contributing to St. Paul's needs is that at Philippi (Philippians 4:15, 16). Taking wages. The expression is again impassioned. It is meant rather ironically than literally. Literally it means rations (1 Corinthians 9:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And wanted. The aorist shows that this sad condition of extreme poverty was a crisis rather than chronic. Yet even at that supreme moment of trial, when from illness or accident the scanty income of his trade failed him, he would not tell them that he was starving, but rather accepted help from the Philippians, who, as he knew, felt for him an unfeigned affection. It is needless to point out once more how strong is the argument in favour of the genuineness of the Acts and the Epistles from the numberless undesigned coincidences between them in such passages as those to which I have referred in the foregoing notes. I was chargeable to no man; literally, I did not benumb you. The word katenarkesa, which occurs only here and in 2 Corinthians 12:13, 14, is ranked by St. Jerome among St. Paul's cilicisms, i.e. the provincial expressions which he picked up during his long residence at Tarsus. Narke (whence our narcissus and narcotie) means \"paralysis,\" and is also the name given to the gymnotus, or electric eel - in Latin, torpedo, the cramp-fish - which benumbs with the shock of its touch. \"I did not,\" he indignantly says, \"cramp you with my torpedo touch.\" Perhaps in a less vehement mood he would have chosen a less picturesque or technical and medical term. That which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied; rather, for the brethren, on their arrival from Macedonia; filled up my deficiency. This must have been the third present which St. Paul received from Philippi (Philippians 4:15, 16). These brethren from Macedonia accompanied Silas and Timotheus (Acts 18:5). And so will I keep myself (2 Corinthians 12:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As the truth of Christ is in me. The strength of St. Paul's feelings on the subject has already been expressed in 1 Corinthians 9:15. We have a similar appeal in Romans 9:1. The \"as\" is not in the original, but evidently the words are meant for a solemn asseveration - \"The truth of Christ is in me, that,\" etc. No man shall stop me of this boasting; literally, this shall not be stopped as concerns me. The verb means literally, \"shall be fenced,\" and with that tendency to over elaboration which is frequent in commentators, some suppose that St. Paul referred to the projected wall across the isthmus of Corinth, etc. But the same word is used for simply stopping the mouth in Romans 3:19; Hebrews 11:33. In the regions of Achaia. He would not apply the rule to Corinth only, but seems to have felt the need for the utmost circumspection, and for cutting off every handle for suspicion or slander among these subtle, loquacious, intellectual Greeks. He could act more freely among the more frank and generous Macedonians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wherefore? Be cannot tell them the real ultimate reason, which is their whole character and nature. Because I love you not?

Wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. \"These new teachers boast to you how disinterested they are. Well, then, I have proved myself to be equally disinterested.\" But the words apparently involve a most stinging sarcasm. For these teachers were not in reality disinterested, though they boasted of being so; on the contrary, they were exacting, insolent, and tyrannical (ver. 20), and did not preach gratuitously (1 Corinthians 9:12), though they sneered at the apostle for doing so. Being radically false (vers. 12, 13), \"while they were,\" as Theodoret says, \"openly boasting, they were secretly taking money,\" and therefore were not \"even as we.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For such are false apostles. This, with 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16 and Philippians 3:2, is one of St. Paul's most passionate outbursts of plain speaking. \"Now at length\" says Bengel, \"he calls a spade a spade.\" They were \"false apostles\" (Revelation 2:2), because a true apostle delivers the message of another, while these cared only for self (Romans 16:18). Deceitful workers. Workmen who cheat their employers (2 Corinthians 2:17; 2 Corinthians 4:2). Transforming themselves.

The allusion may be to the temptation (Matthew 4:8, 9); or to the appearances of Satan with the angels before God in the Book of Job (Job 2:1); or perhaps to the Jewish hagadah, that the \"angel\" who wrestled with Jacob was in reality Satan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Whose end shall be according to their works.

Verse 16. - I say again. St. Paul evidently feels an almost invincible repugnance to begin to speak of his own works. He has twice swerved away from the task (2 Corinthians 10:8; 2 Corinthians 11:1, 6) to speak of collateral topics. Now at last he begins, but only (to our grievous loss) to break off abruptly in ver. 33, before the story of his past sufferings has been much more than begun. A fool... boast. Here, again, we have the two haunting words of this section (see note on ver. 1; 1 Corinthians 15:36; 1 Corinthians 13:3). \"Boast\" occurs sixteen times in these three chapters alone. That I; rather, that I also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Not after the Lord. \"Boasting,\" or what might be stigmatized as such, may become a sort of painful necessity, necessitated by human baseness; but in itself it cannot be \"after the Lord.\" There is nothing Christ-like in it. It is human, not Divine; an earthly necessity, not a heavenly example; a sword of the giant Philistine, which yet David may be forced to use. Confidence; hypostasis, as in 2 Corinthians 9:4, where exactly the same phrase occurs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - After the flesh (see note 2 Corinthians 10:3; comp.

But, as Robertson admirably observes, he \"does not glory in what he has done, but in what he has borne.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Seeing you yourselves are wise; ye gladly tolerate the senseless, being intellectual (comp. 1 Corinthians 4:10). The irony would be very scathing to those whose minds and consciences were sufficiently humble and delicate to feel it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage. The verse gives us an unexpected and painful glimpse of the enslaving (Galatians 2:4), greed-loving (Matthew 23:14; Romans 16;18), gain-hunting (1 Peter 5:2, 3), domineering (3 John 1:9). and even personally violent and insulting character of these teachers; whom yet, strange to say, the Corinthians seem to take at their own estimate, and to tolerate any extreme of insolence from them, while they were jealously suspicious of the disinterested, gentle, and humble apostle. If a man devour you. As the Pharisees \"devoured\" widows' houses (Matthew 23:14). Take of you; rather, seize you; makes you his captives. The verb is the same as \"caught you,\" in 2 Corinthians 12:16. Smite you on the face. They must have brought their insolence with them from Jerusalem, where, as we see, not only from the details of our Lord's various mockeries, but from the accounts of the priests in Josephus and the Talmud, the priests made free use of their fists and staves! The fact that so many of the converts were downtrodden slaves and artisans would make them less likely to resent conduct to which they were daily accustomed among the heathen. Neither Greeks nor Orientals felt to anything like the same extent as ourselves the disgrace of a blow. That sense of disgrace rises flora the freedom which Christianity has gradually wrought for us, and the deep sense of the dignity of human nature, which it has inspired Christ had been so smitten, and so was Paul himself long afterwards (Acts 23:2), and he had to teach even Christian bishops that they must be \"no strikers\" (1 Timothy 3:3; Titus 1:7). The \"syllogism of violence\" has, alas! been in familiar use among religious teachers in all ages (1 Kings 22:24; Nehemiah 13:25; Isaiah 58:4; Matthew 5:39; Luke 22:64; 1 Corinthians 4:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I steak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. The sense is uncertain, but if with the Revised Version we render it, \"I speak by way of disparagement,\" the verse may be understood as an ironical admission that, if absence from these violent and self-assertive proceedings be a sign of weakness, he has been weak. He proceeds to correct the ironical admission in the next clause. The meaning can hardly be, \"I admit the disgraces I have suffered\" (comp. 2 Corinthians 6:8), because he is speaking of the Corinthians, not of himself. I am bold also. If they derive their right to this audacious and overweening line of conduct from any privileges of theirs, there is not one of these privileges which I too may not claim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Hebrews. In the strictest sense those who still understood and spoke Aramaic, not Hellenists of the dispersion, who no longer knew the sacred language. (For the use of the word, see Acts 6:1; Philippians 3:4.) Israelites. Jews, not only by nation, but in heart and feeling (see John 1:48; Acts 2:22, etc.; Romans 9:4; Romans 11:1). The seed of Abraham. Alike literally and spiritually (see John 8:33-53; Romans 9:7; Romans 11:1). It may seem strange that St. Paul should have found it necessary to make this statement; but his Tarsian birth and Roman franchise may have led to whispered innuendoes which took form long afterwards in the wild calumny that he was a Gentile who had only got himself circumcised in order that he might marry the high priest's daughter (Epiphan., 'Haer.,' 30:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I speak as a fool. Not merely as before aphron, but paraphronon,\" I speak as a madman.\" It is downright insanity on my part to enter into this contest of rival egotism. The verb does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament; the substantive is used of \"downright infatuation\" in 2 Peter 2:16. I am more. I may claim to be something beyond an ordinary servant of Christ (comp. 2 Corinthians 11:5). This is the \"frantic\" boast which he proceeds to justify in a fragment of biography which must ever be accounted as the most remarkable and unique in the world's history. And when St. Paul lived the life was, as Dean Stanley says, \"hitherto without precedent in the history of the world.\" No subsequent life of saint or martyr has ever surpassed St. Paul's, as here sketched, in self-devotion; and no previous life even remotely resembled it. The figure of the Christian missionary was, until then, unknown. In labours more abundant; literally, more abundantly. The best comment is 1 Corinthians 15:10. In stripes above measure. The expression is partly explained in the next verse. In prisons. St. Clement of Rome says that St. Paul was imprisoned seven times. The only imprisonment up to this date recorded in the Acts is that at Philippi (Acts 16:23). The imprisonments in Jerusalem, Caesarea, and Rome all took place later. He says later,\" The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city that bonds and imprisonment await me\" (Acts 20:23). In deaths oft. He alludes to the incessant opposition, peril, and anguish which make him say in 1 Corinthians 15:31, \"I die daily\" (comp. 2 Corinthians 4:11; Romans 8:36). With the whole passage we may compare 2 Corinthians 6:4, 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Five times. Not one of these Jewish scourgings - which yet were so severe that the sufferer often died under them - is mentioned in the Acts. This paragraph is the most striking proof of the complete fragmentariness of that narrative, marvellous as it is. On the circumstances which probably led to these Jewish scourgings, see 'Life of St. Paul,' exc. 11; and comp. Acts 22:19; Acts 26:11; Matthew 23:34. The question arises - Was St. Luke entirely unaware of all these scenes of anguish and daily martyrdom? Had St. Paul, in his humble reticence, never cared to speak of them? or were the Acts only intended for a sketch which made no pretension to completeness, and only related certain scenes and events by way of specimen and example? Forty stripes save one (Deuteronomy 25:3). On this instance of Jewish scrupulosity, and for all that is known of the rationale of Jewish scourgings, see 'Life of St. Paul,' ubi supra.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Thrice was I beaten with rods. This alludes to scourgings inflicted by Gentile magistrates with the vitis, or vine stick, of soldiers, or with the fasces of lictors. Only one of these horrible scourgings, which likewise often ended in death, is narrated in the Acts (Acts 16:22). We do not know when the others were inflicted. In any case they were egregious violations of St. Paul's right of Roman citizenship; but this claim (as we see in Cicero's various orations) was often set at nought in the provinces. Once was I stoned. At Lystra (Acts 14:19). Thrice I suffered shipwreck. Not one of these shipwrecks is narrated in the Acts. The shipwreck of Acts 27, took place some years later. A night and a day I have been in the deep. An allusion, doubtless, to his escape from one of the shipwrecks by floating for twenty-four hours on a plank in the stormy sea. We have no right to assume that the deliverance was miraculous. The perfect tense shows St. Paul's vivid reminiscence of this special horror. \"In the deep\" means \"floating on the deep waves.\" Theophylact explains the words ἐν βυθῷ to mean \"in Bythos,\" and says that it was a place near Lystra, apparently like the Athenian Barathrum and the Spartan Caeadas - a place where the bodies of criminals were thrown. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - In journeyings often. In those days and in those countries journeys were not only perilous and fatiguing, but also accompanied with many severe hardships and discomforts. In perils of waters; rather, of rivers. In all countries which, like parts of Greece and Asia Minor, abound in unbridged mountain torrents, journeys are constantly accompanied by deaths from drowning in the sudden rush of swollen streams. In perils of robbers. Then, as now, brigandage was exceedingly common in the mountains of Greece and Asia. In perils from mine own countrymen; literally, from my race. These are abundantly recorded in the New Testament (Acts 9:23, 29; Acts 13:50; Acts 14:5, 19; Acts 20:3, etc.; 1 Thessalonians 2:15, 16; Philippians 3:2) From the heathen. They were generally instigated by the Jews (Acts 16:19-39, 17:5; 19:23-34, etc.). In the city. As at Damascus, Jerusalem, Philippi, Thessalonica, Beroea, Ephesus, etc. - \"in every city\" (Acts 20:23). In the wilderness. As, for instance, in travelling through the wild waste tracts of land between Perga and Antioch in Pisidia, or thence to Lystra and Derbe; or over the mountain chains of Taurus to the cities of Galatia. In the sea. Storms, leaks, pirates, mutinies, etc. Among false brethren. The word only occurs elsewhere in Galatians 2:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - In weariness and painfulness; literally, in toil and travail (1 Thessalonians 2:9 2 Thessalonians 3:8). In watchings; literally, in spells of sleeplessness (Acts 20:34). In hunger and thirst (ver. 8; 1 Corinthians 4:11; Philippians 4:12). In fastings often. It is not clear whether this refers to voluntary fastings (2 Corinthians 6:5; Acts 27:9) or to general destitution short of the actual pangs of hunger. In cold and nakedness. St. Paul's ideal, like that of his Master Christ, was the very antithesis of that adopted by the wealthy, honoured, and full-fed Shammais and Hillels of Jewish rabbinism, who delighted in banquets, fine garments, pompous titles, domestic comforts, and stationary ease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Those things that are without. The adverb thus rendered parektos only occurs in Matthew 5:32; Acts 26:29. It may either mean \"trials that come to me from external and extraneous sources (quae extrinsecus accedunt) or things in addition to these (praeterea), which I here leave unmentioned.\" The latter meaning is (as St. Chrysostom saw) almost certainly the correct one. That which cometh upon me. The word thus rendered is either episustasis (J, K), which means \"hostile attack\" or \"tumult,\" as we talk of \"a rush of trouble or business;\" or epistasis (א, B, D, E, F, G), which may imply \"halting, lingering thoughts; \"attention,\" and so \"anxiety\" (comp. Acts 24:12, where there is the same various reading). Of all the Churches.

See, by way of example, 1 Corinthians 8:13; 1 Corinthians 9:22; Romans 14:21. Instead of stiffly maintaining my own prejudices, I am always ready to make concessions to weak brethren. Who is offended, and I burn not! That is, \"who is ever caused to stumble without my burning with indignation?\" In other words, \"Is not the intensity of my sympathy whenever any scandal occurs an addition to the trials of my life?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - If I must needs. If boasting is forced on me as a moral necessity (δεῖ). The things which concern mine infirmities. After all, St. Paul cannot keep up even for a few verses anything which can be regarded as \"boasting after the flesh\" (ver. 18). Practically his boasting has been only of those afflictions which to others might sound like a record of disgraces, but which left on him the marks of the Lord Jesus. His hairbreadth escapes were to him, as Bossuet said of the wounds of the Prince of Conde, \"marks of the protection of Heaven.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. This solemn asseveration does not seem to be retrospective. It is used to preface what was perhaps intended to be a definite sketch of the most perilous incidents and trials of his life, which would have been to us of inestimable value. This awful attestation of his truthfulness was necessary,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because even the very little which we do know shows us that the tale would have been \"passing strange;\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because his base and shameless calumniators had evidently insinuated that he was not straightforward (2 Corinthians 12:16).

(For the incident referred to, see Acts 9:22-25.) The governor; literally, the ethnarch. This is obviously the title given to the commandant of the city (whether an Arabian or a Jew), left in charge by Aretas. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but is found in 1 Macc. 14:47; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:07, § 2. Under Aretas the king. Hareth, the Emir of Petra, father-in-law of Herod the Great. He had either seized the city during his war with Herod, to avenge the insult offered to his daughter by Herod's adultery with Herodias; or it may have been assigned to him by Caligula. His relations with Damascus are confirmed by coins (see 'Life of St. Paul,' exc. 8.). Kept... with a garrison; literally, was guarding. It is said in Acts 9:24 that the Jews did this; but they could not in any case have done it without leave from the ethnarch, and qui facit per alium, facit per se. Desirous to apprehend me. Both words are a little stronger in the Greek - \"determining to seize me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians11:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Through a window. A \"little door,\" or lattice in some house which abutted on the wall. In a basket (comp. Joshua 2:15; 1 Samuel 19:12). The word used by St. Luke in Acts 9:25 is spuris, which is a general name for a large basket. The word here used is sargane, which is defined by Hesychius to be a basket of wickerwork, but which may also mean a rope basket. This particular incident, no doubt, seems to be less perilous and trying than many which St. Paul has already mentioned. We must, however, remember that escape from a window in the lofty wall of a city guarded by patrols was very perilous, and also that such a method of concealment was very trying to the dignity of an Oriental rabbi, such as St. Paul had been. Further, it is clear that St. Paul only mentions this as the earliest incident in along line of perils which it had been his original intention to recount. But at this point he was interrupted, and laid aside his task of dictation - an incident which has not unfrequently had its effect in literature. When next he resumed, the Epistle, he was no longer in the mood to break through his rule of reticence on these subjects. He had played \"the fool\" and \"the madman,\" as he says of himself with indignant irony, enough; and he proceeds to speak of other personal claims which he regards as more Important and more Divine. Of all \"chapters of unwritten history,\" not one is more deeply to be regretted than the one which we have them lost.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

This rendering follows the best-attested reading; but it is at least doubtful whether, instead of δεῖ or δὲ, the ironic δὴ of Κ, Μ, and the Greek Fathers is not the true reading. In mere vowel variations, especially in passages where the meaning does not lie on the surface, the diplomatic (external) evidence is less important. If St. Paul wrote δὴ, it means, \"of course it is not expedient for me to boast.\" I will come; for I will come; if the reading of D is correct. In that case it is hardly possible to define the counter currents of feeling which caused the use of the conjunction. Visions and revelations. The word used for \"visions\" means presentations perceived in a state which is neither sleeping nor waking, but which are regarded as objective; \"revelations\" are the truths apprehended as a result of the visions. Optasia, for \"visions,\" only occurs elsewhere in Luke 1:22; Luke 24:23; Acts 26:19 (comp. Galatians 2:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I knew; rather, I know. A man. St. Paul speaks in this indirect way of himself (see vers. 5, 7). In Christ (1 Corinthians 1:30). To St. Paul every true Christian was a man whose personal life was lost in the life of Christ. Above fourteen years ago. The note of time is very vague. If we are at all able to identify the vision alluded to, it must have been the vision in the temple, referred to in Acts 22:17, which was, roughly speaking, \"about fourteen years\" before this time. The vision on the road to Damascus had occurred about twenty years earlier than the date of this Epistle. Whether in the body, etc. A powerful description of the absorption of all conscious bodily modes of apprehension. In their comments on. these verses, many commentators enter into speculations which seem to me to be so entirely arbitrary and futile that I shall not even allude to them. St. Paul's bodily and mental state during this vision is familiar to all who know the history of Oriental and mediaeval mysticism. Caught up (Ezekiel 11:24; Acts 8:39; Revelation 4:1, 2). Into the third heaven. It is most unlikely that St. Paul is here in any way referring to the Jewish hagadoth about seven heavens. The expression is purely general, and even the rabbis did not expect to be taken au pied de la lettre. Hence all speculations about first, second, and third heavens are idle and useless. Even as late as the Clementine writings in the middle of the second century, an attempt is made, in reference to this passage, to disparage St. Paul by sneering at visions as a medium of revelation, on the ground that they may spring from self-deception; and this rapture of the \"bald hook-nosed Galilean\" to the third heaven is also sneered at in the 'Philopatris' of the pseudo-Lucian. Yet how modest and simple is St. Paul's awestruck reference to this event, when compared, not only with the lying details of Mohammed's visit to heaven, but even with the visions of St. Theresa or Swedenborg!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Into Paradise. Here, again, we encounter long speculations as to whether Paradise is the same as the third heaven; whether St.,Paul is referring to two visions or two parts of one vision. Such questions are clearly insoluble, and I leave them where I find them. We shall never understand this passage otherwise than in the dim and vague outline in which St. Paul has purposely left it. All that we can know from the New Testament about Paradise must be learnt from this verse and Luke 23:43 and Revelation 2:7, and it is extremely little. Unspeakable words. A figure of speech called an oxymoron. Utterances (or \"things\") incapable of utterance. Not lawful for a man to utter.

Verse 7. - Lest I should be exalted above measure; literally, that I may not be over exalted. It was necessary to show St. Paul that he only held the treasure in an earthen vessel. There was given me. Even God's afflictions are meant for gifts. A thorn (skolops). The more usual meaning is, as Hesychius says, \"a sharp stake\" ('Sudes,' Tert.). Hence the word skolopizo, I impale or crucify. St. Paul's agony was an impalement or crucifixion of all sensual impulses and earthly ambitions. In the flesh. There have been endless conjectures as to the exact nature of this painful and most humbling physical affliction. It is only by placing side by side a great many separate passages that we are almost irresistibly led to the conclusion which is now most generally adopted, namely, that it was acute and disfiguring ophthalmia, originating in the blinding glare of the light which flashed round him at Damascus, and accompanied, as that most humiliating disease usually is, by occasional cerebral excitement. It would be impossible here to enter into the whole inquiry, for which! refer to my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:214-226. The messenger of Satan; rather, an angel of Satan. By way of comment, see Matthew 25:41; Luke 13:16; Job 2:7; Revelation 12:7, 9. To buffet me. The verb is derived from kolaphos, a slap on the face, and would be suitable to such a disfigurement as ophthalmia (2 Corinthians 10:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For this thing.

The original is much more forcible: \"And he has said to me.\" Is sufficient for thee. A similar phrase, though in a very different context, occurs in Deuteronomy 3:26. My strength is made perfect in weakness (comp. 2 Corinthians 4:7; Philippians 4:13; 1 Corinthians 2:3-5). The verse contains a paradox, which yet describes the best history of the world. The paradox becomes more suggestive if, with א, A, B, D, F, G, we omit \"my.\" May rest upon me; literally, may tabernacle over me. The compound verb occurs here alone, but the simple verb and the substantive occur in similar meanings in John 1:14; Revelation 7:15; Revelation 21:3 (comp. 2 Corinthians 5:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I take pleasure in; I am content to bear them cheerfully (2 Corinthians 7:4; Romans 5:3).

The verb gives one more side allusion, not without bitterness, to the commendatory epistles of which his adversaries boasted (2 Corinthians 3:1; 2 Corinthians 5:12; 2 Corinthians 10:12-18).

He had been ready twice before, though the second time his actual visit had been prevented by the scandals in their Church.

The \"I\" is emphatic. It is shocking to think that, even after Paul has so triumphantly cleared himself from the disgraceful charge of trying to make gain out of the Corinthians, he should still be obliged to meet the slanderous innuendo that, even if he had not personally tried to get anything out of them, still he had done so indirectly through the agency of Titus. Being crafty, I caught you with guile. He is here quoting the sneer of his enemies (see what he has already said in 2 Corinthians 1:12; 2 Corinthians 7:2).

It has been explained as a reference to examinations which he intended to hold on his arrival at Corinth.

As if I were present, the second time. The meaning seems to be, \"You must understand this announcement as distinctly as if I were with you, and uttered it by word of mouth.\" And being absent now I write; rather, so now being absent. The verb \"I write\" is almost certainly an explanatory gloss. And to all other; rather, and to the rest, all of them. Namely, to those who, though they may not have fallen into gross sin, still rejected St. Paul's authority, and said that he was afraid to come in person.

But we shall live with him... toward you. This thought of participation alike in Christ's humiliation and his glory, alike in his weakness and his might, was very familiar to St. Paul (2 Corinthians 4:10-12; Ephesians 1:19, 20), Here, however, the following words,\" toward you,\" i.e.\" with reference to you,\" show that the life of which he is thinking is the vigorous reestablishment of his spiritual authority in Christ over the Church of Corinth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Prove year ownselves. In other words, \"test your own sincerity.\" Jesus Christ is in you. To this truth - that the body of every Christian is a temple of the Holy Spirit of Christ - St. Paul returns again and again (Galatians 2:20; Galatians 4:19; Ephesians 3:17; Colossians 1:27). We find the same truth frequently in St. John (John 15:4, 5; 1 John 3:24, etc.). Except ye be reprobates. The Greek word adokimoi - from the same root as the verb \"to test\" - means tried and found to be worthless. \"Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them\" (Jeremiah 6:30). The word is found almost exclusively in St Paul (2 Corinthians 13:5, 6, 7; Romans 1:28; 1 Corinthians 9:27; 2 Timothy 3:8; Titus 1:16). The only other passage of the New Testament where it occurs is Hebrews 6:8; and the reader must not read Calvinistic horrors into an expression which gives no sanction to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - That we are not reprobates.

The opposite of \"reprobates.\" Though we be as reprobates; rather, [I pray] that ye may do what is excellent, and that we may be as reprobates. This is one of the intense expressions which, like Romans 9:3, spring from the earnest and passionate unselfishness of St. Paul. His anxiety is for them, not at all for himself. As reprobates; i.e. in the judgment of men (comp. Romans 9:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - We can do nothing against the truth.

Strong; \"powerful (2 Corinthians 10:4). We wish; rather, we pray. Your perfection; rather, your perfect union; \"the readjustment of your disordered elements.\" A similar word occurs in Ephesians 4:10, and the verb in ver. 11; 1 Corinthians 1:10; 1 Thessalonians 3:10, etc. It is also used in the Gospels for \"mending nets\" (Mark 1:19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I should use sharpness.

His concluding words are marked by great gentleness, as though to heal the effects of the sharp rebuke and irony to which he has been compelled to have recourse. The word may also moan \"rejoice\" (Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:4). Be perfect (see note on \"perfection\" in ver. 9). Be of one mind; literally, think the same thing (Philippians 2:2; 1 Peter 3:8; 1 Corinthians 1:10; Romans 12:16, 18).

Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The grace of our Lord, etc. This is the only place where the full apostolic benediction occurs, and is alone sufficient to prove the doctrine of the Trinity. St. Paul seems to feel that the fullest benediction is needed at the close of the severest letter. With you all. The word \"all\" is here introduced with special tenderness and graciousness. Some have sinned before; some have not repented; yet he has for them all one prayer and one blessing and one \"seal of holy apostolic love? The superscription, though of no authority, may here correctly state that the letter was written at Philippi, and conveyed thence to Corinth by Titus and (possibly) Luke (see 2 Corinthians 8:16-22). These are the last recorded words addressed by St. Paul to the Corinthian Church. The results produced by the letter and by his visit of three months (Acts 20:2, 3) were probably satisfactory, for we hear no more of any troubles at Corinth during his lifetime, and the spirit in which he writes the letter to the Romans from Corinth seems to have been unwontedly calm. He had been kindly welcomed (Romans 15:23), and the collection, about which he had been so anxious, seems to have fully equalled his expectations, for as we know (Romans 16:18; Acts 20:4), he conveyed it to Jerusalem in person with the delegates of the Churches. We gain a subsequent glimpse of the Corinthian Church. Some thirty-five years later, when a letter, which is still extant, was addressed to them by St. Clement of Rome, they were still somewhat inclined to be turbulent, disunited, and sceptical (see 'Ep. ad Corinthians,' 3, 4, 13, 14, 37, etc.); but still there are some marked signs of improvement. About A.D. they were visited by Hegesippus (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 4:22), who spoke very favourably of them, especially of their obedience and liberality. Their bishop, Dionysius, was at that time exercising a widespread influence (Eusebius 'Hist. Eccl.,' 4:23).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPaul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - By the will of God (see 1 Corinthians 1:1). In the face of Judaizing opponents, it was essential that he should vindicate his independent apostolate (Acts 26:15-18). And Timothy. Timothy had been absent from St. Paul when he wrote the First Epistle, and Sosthenes had taken his place, whether as amanuensis or merely as a sort of joint authenticator. Our brother; literally, the brother, as in 1 Corinthians 1:1. The brotherhood applies both to St. Paul and to the Corinthians; there was a special bond of brotherhood between all members of \"the household of faith.\" The saints. Before the name \"Christians\" had come into general use, \"saints\" (Acts 9:13) and \"brethren\" were common designations or' those who were \"faithful in Christ Jesus\" (Ephesians 1:1). In all Achaia. In its classical sense Achaia means only the northern strip of the Peloponnesus; as a Roman province the name included both Hellas and the Peloponnesus. Hero St. Paul probably uses it in its narrower sense. The only strictly Achaian Church of which we know is Cenchrea, but doubtless there were little Christian communities along the coasts of the Corinthian gulf. To the Church at Athens St. Paul never directly alludes. This letter was not in any sense an encyclical letter; but even if it were not read in other communities, the Corinthians would convey to them the apostle's greeting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGrace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Grace be to you and peace.

This outburst of thanksgiving was meant to repress the relief brought to the overcharged feelings of the apostle by the arrival of Titus, with news respecting the mixed, but on the whole good, effect produced at Corinth by the severe remarks of his first letter. It is characteristic of the intense and impetuous rush of emotion which we often notice in the letters of St. Paul, that he does not here state the special grounds for this impassioned thanksgiving; he only touches upon it for a moment in 2 Corinthians 2:13, and does not pause to state it fully until 2 Corinthians 7:5-16. It is further remarkable that in this Epistle almost alone he utters no thanksgiving for the moral growth and holiness of the Church to which he is writing. This may be due to the fact that there was still so much to blame; but it more probably arose from the tumult of feeling which throughout this letter disturbs the regular flow of his thoughts. The ordinary \"thanksgiving\" for his readers is practically, though indirectly, involved in the gratitude which he expresses to God for the sympathy and communion which exists between himself and the Church of Corinth. Even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Greek is the same as in Ephesians 1:3, where, literally rendered, it is, \"Blessed be the God and Father.\" The same phrase is found also in 1 Peter 1:3; Colossians 1:3. The meaning is not, \"Blessed be the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (although the expression, \"the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,\" occurs in Ephesians 1:17: comp. John 20:17), but \"Blessed be God, who is also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\" and who is therefore \"our Father\" by adoption and redemption, as well as our God by creation. The Father of mercies. This corresponds to a Hebrew expression, and means that compassionateness is the most characteristic attribute of God, and emanation from him. He is the Source of all mercy; and mercyNEWLINENEWLINE\"Is an attribute of God himself.\" He is \"full of compassion, and gracious, tong-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth\" (Psalm 86:15). \"The Law,\" says the Talmud, \"begins and ends with an act of mercy. At its commencement God clothes the naked; at its close be buries the dead\" ('Sotah,' f. 14, 1). Thus every chapter but one of the Koran is headed, \"In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful;\" and it is an Eastern expression to say of one that has died that. \"he is taken to the mercy of the Merciful.\" Comp. \"Father of glory,\" Ephesians 1:17; 1 Corinthians 2:8 (\"of spirits,\" Hebrews 12:9; \"of lights,\" James 1:17). The plural, \"compassions,\" is perhaps a plural of excellence, \"exceeding compassion\" (Romans 12:1), and may be influenced by the Hebrew word rachamim, often literally rendered by St. Paul \"bowels.\" The article in the Greek (\"the Father of the compassions\") specializes the mercy. The God of all comfort. So in 2 Corinthians 13:11 God is called \"the God of love and peace;\" Romans 15:5, \"the God of patience and of comfort;\" 2:15, \"the God of hope.\" This word \"comfort\" (unfortunately interchanged with \"consolation\" in the Authorized Version) and the word \"affliction\" (varyingly rendered by \"trouble\" and \"tribulation\" in the Authorized Version), are the keynotes of this passage; and to some extent of the whole Epistle. St. Paul is haunted as it were and possessed by them. \"Comfort,\" as verb or substantive, occurs ten times in vers. 3-7; and \"affliction\" occurs four times in succession. It is characteristic of St. Paul's style to be thus dominated, as it were, by a single word (comp. notes on 2 Corinthians 3:2, 13; 4:2; see note on 2 Corinthians 10:8). The needless variations of the Authorized Version were well intentioned, but arose from a false notion of style, a deficient sense of the precision of special words, and an inadequate conception of the duties of faithful translation, which requires that we should as exactly as possible reflect the peculiarities of the original, and not attempt to improve upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Who comforteth us. The \"us\" implies here, not only St. Paul and Timothy, but also the Corinthians, who are one with them in a bond of Christian unity which was hitherto undreamed of, and was a new phenomenon in the world. St. Paul always uses the first person in passages where he is speaking directly of individual feelings and experiences. In other passages he likes to lose himself, as it were, in the Christian community. The delicate play of emotion is often shown by the rapid interchanges of singular and plural (see vers. 13, 15, 17; 2 Corinthians 2:1, 11, 14, etc.). The present, \"comforteth,\" expresses a continuous experience, with which the Christians of the first age were most happily familiar (John 14:16-18; 2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17). In all our affliction. The collective experience of affliction is sustained by the collective experience of comfort. That we may be able to comfort. Thus St. Paul takes \"a teleological view of sorrow.\" It is partly designed as a school of sympathy. It is a part of the training of an apostle, just as suffering is essential to one who is to be a sympathetic high priest (Hebrews 5:1, 2). In any trouble. The original more forcibly repeats the words, \"in all affliction.\" Wherewith we ourselves are comforted. By means of the comfort which God gives us, we can, by the aid of blessed experience, communicate comfort to others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As the sufferings of Christ abound in us; rather, unto us. \"The sufferings of Christ\" are the sufferings which he endured in the days of his flesh, and they were not exhausted by him, but overflow to us who have to suffer as he suffered, bearing about with us his dying, that we may share his life (2 Corinthians 4:10). The idea is, not that he is suffering in us and with us (though the truth of his intense sympathy with his suffering Church may be shadowed forth in some such terms, Matthew 25:40-45; Acts 9:4), but that we have \"a fellowship in his sufferings\" (Philippians 3:17); Galatians 2:20, \"I have been crucified with Christ;\" Hebrews 13:13, \"Bearing his reproach.\" Our sufferings are the sufferings of Christ because we suffer as he suffered (1 Peter 4:13) and in the same cause. Aboundeth by Christ. If his sufferings, as it were, overflow to us, so too is he the Source of our comfort, in that he sendeth us the Comforter (John 14:16-18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And; rather, but. The verse expresses the additional thought that the comfort (i.e. encouragement and strengthening) of the apostle, as well as his affliction, was not only designed for his own spiritual training, but was the source of direct blessing to his converts, because it enabled him, both by example (Philippians 1:14) and by the lessons of experience, to strengthen others in affliction, and so to further their salvation by teaching them how to endure (Romans 5:34). The affliction brings encouragement, and so works endurance in us, and, by our example and teaching, in you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And our hope of you is steadfast; literally, And our hope is steadfast on your behalf. The variations of text and punctuation in the verse do not materially affect the sense. The meaning is \"And I have a sure hope that you will reap the benefits of our common fellowship with Christ in his affliction, and of the comfort which he sends, because I know that you have experienced the sufferings, and am therefore sure that he will send you the strength and the endurance. The close connection of tribulation and Divine encouragement are found also in Matthew 5:4; 2 Timothy 2:12; 1 Peter 5:10. The interchange of the two between teacher and taught is part of the true communion of saints (comp. Philippians 2:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant. This is a favourite phrase with St. Paul (Romans 1:13; Romans 11:25; 1 Corinthians 12:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:13). Of our trouble; rather, about our affliction. He assumes that they are aware what the trouble was, and he does not specially mention it. What he wants them to know is that, by the help of their prayers and sympathy, God had delivered him out of this affliction, crushing as it was. Which came to us in Asia. Most commentators refer this to the tumult at Ephesus (Acts 19.); and since St. Paul's dangers, sicknesses, and troubles are clearly understated throughout the Acts, it is possible that the perils and personal maltreatment which were liable to occur during such a season of excitement may have brought on some violent illness; or, again, be may have suffered from some plots (1 Corinthians 16:9, 32; Acts 20:19) or shipwreck (2 Corinthians 11:25). In Romans 16:4 he alludes again to some extreme peril. But St. Paul seems systematically to have made light of external dangers and sufferings. All his strongest expressions (see Romans 9:1-3, etc.) are reserved for mental anguish and affliction. What he felt most keenly was the pang of lacerated affections. It is, therefore, possible that he is here alluding to the overpowering tumult of feelings which had been aroused by his anxiety as to the reception likely to be accorded to his first letter. To this and the accompanying circumstances he alludes again and again (2 Corinthians 2:4, 12; 2 Corinthians 7:5, etc.). The sense of \"comfort\" resulting from the tidings brought by Titus (2 Corinthians 7:6, 7, 13) is as strong as that expressed in these verses, and the allusion to this anguish of heart is specially appropriate here, because he is dwelling on the sympathetic communion between himself and his converts, both in their sorrows and their consolations. That we were pressed cut of measure, above strength; literally, that toe were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power. The trial seemed too heavy for him to bear. The phrase here rendered \"out of measure\" occurs in 2 Corinthians 4:17; Romans 7:13; 1 Corinthians 12:31; Galatians 1:13; but is only found in this particular group of letters. Insomuch that we despaired even of life. This rendering conveys the meaning. Literally it is, so that we were even in utter perplexity (2 Corinthians 4:8) even about life. \"I fell into such agony of mind that I hardly hoped to survive.\" Generally, although he was often in perplexity, he succeeded in resisting despair (2 Corinthians 4:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But; perhaps rather, yea. The word strengthens the phrase, \"were in utter perplexity.\" We had the sentence of death in ourselves. The original is more emphatic, \"Ourselves in our own selves we have had.\" Not only did all the outer world look dark to me, but the answer which my own spirit returned to the question,\" What will be the end of it all?\" was \"Death!\" and that doom still seems to echo in my spirit. The sentence; rather, the answer. The word is unique in the LXX. and the New Testament. In ourselves. Because I seemed to myself to be beyond all human possibility of deliverance. That we should not trust in ourselves. There was a divinely intended meaning in my despair. It was meant to teach me, not only submission, but absolute trust in God (see Jeremiah 17:5, 7). Which raiseth the dead. Being practically dead - utterly crushed with anguish and despairing of deliverance - I learnt by my deliverance to have faith in God as one who can raise men even from the dead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - From so great a death. From a state of dejection and despair, which seemed to show death in all its power (see 2 Corinthians 4:10-12). And doth deliver. Perhaps a pious marginal gloss which has crept into the text of some manuscripts. We trust; rather, we have set our hope. That. This word is omitted in some good manuscripts, as also are the words, \"and doth deliver.\" He will yet deliver us. This implies either that the perils alluded to were not yet absolutely at an end, or St. Paul s consciousness that many a peril of equal intensity lay before him in the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ye also helping together by prayer for us. St. Paul had a deep conviction of the efficacy of intercessory prayer (Romans 15:30, 31; Philippians 1:19; Philemon 1:22). By the means of many persons; literally, from many faces. Probably the word prosopon here has its literal meaning. The verse, then, means \"that from many faces the gift to us may be thankfully acknowledged by many on our behalf.\" God, he implies, will be well pleased when he sees the gratitude beaming from the many countenances of those who thank him for his answer to their prayers on his behalf. The word for \"gift\" is charisma, which means a gift of grace, a gift of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - Vindication of his right to their sympathy. Verse 12. - For our rejoicing; rather, for our boasting is this. My expression of confidence in your sympathy with me may sound like a boast, but my boast merely accords with the testimony of my conscience that I have been sincere and honest to all, and most of all to you. The testimony of our conscience. To this St. Paul frequently appeals (Acts 23:1; Acts 24:16; Romans 9:1; 1 Corinthians 4:4). In simplicity; rather, in holiness. The best reading is ἁγιότητι (א, A, B, C, K), not ἀπλότητι. \"Holiness\" seems to have been altered to \"simplicity,\" both on dogmatic grounds and because it is a rare word, only occurring in Hebrews 12:10. And godly sincerity; literally, sincerity of God; i.e. sincerity which is a gift of Divine grace (comp. \"peace of God,\" Philippians 4:7; \"righteousness of God,\" Romans 1:17). For the word used for \"sincerity,\" see note on 1 Corinthians 5:8. Not with fleshly wisdom (comp. 2 Corinthians 2:17; 1 Corinthians 2:4), but by the grace of God. The preposition in both clauses is \"in.\" The grace of God was the atmosphere which the apostle breathed, the sphere in which he worked. We have had our conversation. We lived and moved. The word \"conversation\" originally meant \"mode of life,\" and is used to translate both anastrophe and politeuma, which means properly \"citizenship.\" The exclusive modern sense of \"conversation\" is not earlier than the last century. In the world; i.e. in my general life as regards all men. More abundantly to you-ward. Sincerity, holiness, the signs of the grace of God, were specially shown by the apostle towards the Corinthians, because they were specially needed to guide his relations towards a Church which inspired him with deep affection, but which required special wisdom to guide and govern. The fact that, in spite of all his exceptional care, such bitter taunts could still be levelled at him, shows that he had not been mistaken in supposing that no Church required from him a more anxious watchfulness over all his conduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For we write none other things unto you, etc. Remarks like these obviously presuppose that the conduct and character of St. Paul had been misrepresented and calumniated. The perpetual recurrence to a strain of self-defence would have been needless if some one - probably Titus - had not told St. Paul that his opponents accused him of insincerity. Here, therefore, he tells them that he is opening out his very heart towards them. What he had to say to them and of them was here set forth without any subterfuges or arrieres pensees. He had nothing esoteric which differed from exoteric teaching. It is a melancholy thought that even such a one as Paul was reduced to the sad necessity of defending himself against such charges as that he intrigued with individual members of his Churches, wrote private letters or sent secret messages which differed in tone from those which were read in the public assembly. Or acknowledge; rather, or even fully know; i.e. from other sources. The paronomasia of the original cannot be preserved in English, but in Latin would be \"Quae legitis aut etiam inteltigitis.\" And I trust... even to the end; rather, but I hope that, even unto the end, ye will fully know - even as ye fully knew us in part - that we are your subject of boast. After telling them that they have in this letter his genuine and inmost thoughts, he adds that \"even as some of them (for this seem to be implied by the 'in part') already knew well that the mutual relations between him and them were something wherein to glory, he hopes that they will appreciate this fact, even to the end.\" He knows that some honour him; he hopes that all will do so; but he can only express this as a hope, for he is aware that there are calumnies abroad respecting him, so that he cannot feel sure of their unbroken allegiance. Such seems to be the meaning; but the state of mind in which St. Paul wrote has evidently troubled his style, and his expressions are less lucid and more difficult to unravel in this Epistle than in any other. To the end. The expression is quite general, like our \"to the last.\" He does not seem definitely to imply either to the end of his life or to the coming of Christ, which they regarded as the end of all things, as in 1 Corinthians 1:8; 1 Corinthians 15:24; Hebrews 3:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In part. Not as a whole Church. Some only of the Corinthians had been faithful to his teaching and to himself. (For the phrase, see Romans 11:25; Romans 15:15, 24; 1 Corinthians 11:18; 1 Corinthians 12:27; 1 Corinthians 13:9) Rejoicing; rather, ground of boast, as in 2 Corinthians 9:3; Romans 4:2, \"whereof to glory;\" 1 Corinthians 5:6. In ver. 12 the substantive means \"the act of rejoicing.\" The word is characteristic of this group of Epistles, in which it occurs forty-six times, Even as ye also are ours. This clause takes away all semblance of self-glorification. In 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20 and Philippians 2:16 he expresses the natural thought that a teacher's converts are, and will be in the last day, his \"crown of exultation.\" Here alone he implies that they may glory in him as he in them. The thought, however, so far frond being egotistical, merely indicates the in. tense intercommunion of sympathy which existed between him and them. He does but place himself on a level with his converts, and imply that they mutually gloried in each other. In the day of the Lord Jesus (see on 1 Corinthians 3:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-22. - His change of purpose in visiting Corinth. Verse 15. - In this confidence. In reliance on the mutual respect and affection which exists between us. I was minded. The stress is partly on the tense: \"my original desire was.\" When speaking of matters purely personal, St. Paul generally reverts to the first person. To come unto you before. I meant to visit you, first on my way to Macedonia, and again on my return from Macedonia, as explained in the next verse. A second benefit; rather, a second grace. There is another reading, χαρὰν, joy, and the word χάρις itself sometimes has this sense (as in Tobit 7:18), but not in the New Testament. Here, again, there is no boastfulness. St. Paul, filled as he was with the power of the Holy Spirit, was able to impart to his converts some spiritual gifts (Romans 1:11), and this was the chief reason why his visits were so eagerly desired, and why his change of plan had caused such bitter disappointment to the Corinthians. The importance of the Church of Corinth, its central position, and its unsettled state made it desirable that he should give them as much as possible of his personal supervision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To be brought on my way (see note on 1 Corinthians 16:6) toward Judaea (1 Corinthians 16:4-6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - When I therefore was thus minded. Without saying in so many words that all this plan was now given up, he proceeds to defend himself against the charges which had been evidently brought against him by his opponents. The Corinthians were aware that he no longer meant to come to them direct from Ephesus. They had certainly been informed of this by Titus, and he had indeed briefly stated it in 1 Corinthians 16:5. Their disappointment had led some of them into angry criticisms upon the \"indecision\" of the apostle, the more so because he had (out of kindness, as he here shows) spared them the pain of expressing his reasons. Did I use lightness? Was this change of plan a sign of \"the levity\" with which some of you charge me? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, etc.? Every phrase in this clause is of ambiguous meaning. For instance, the \"or\" may imply another charge, namely, that his purposes are carnal, and therefore capricious; or it may be the alternative view of his conduct, stated by way of self-defence - namely, \"Does my change of plan imply that I am frivolous? or, on the contrary, are not my plans of necessity mere human plans, and therefore liable to be overruled by God's will?\" Thus the meaning of the \"or\" is doubtful, and also the meaning of\" according to the flesh.\" Generally this phrase is used in a bad sense, as in 2 Corinthians 10:2 and Romans 8:1; but it may also be used to mean \"in a human way,\" as in 2 Corinthians 5:16. That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay. There is probably no clause in the New Testament of which the certain sense must be left so indeterminate as this.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The Authorized Version gives one way of taking the clause. The grammar equally admits of the rendering.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That with me the yea should be yea, and the nay nay. Whichever rendering we adept, it may be explained in accordance with the view indicated in the last note. \"I was not showing the levity which my opponents speak of, but my purposes are necessarily mere human purposes, and therefore my 'yes' and 'no' can be only 'yes' and 'no' when I make a plan. My 'yes' or 'no' may be overruled by the Spirit (Acts 16:7) or even hindered by Satan, and that more than once (1 Thessalonians 2:18).\" \"With me,\" i.e. as far as I am concerned, I can only say \"yes\" or\" no;\" but l'homme propose, Dieu dispose. His intended double visit to them was prevented, not by any frivolity of his, but, as he afterwards shows, by their own unfaithfulness and his desire to spare them. There is yet a third way of taking it which involves a different meaning - \"In order that with me the 'yea yea ' may be also ' nay nay,'\" Am I inconsistent? or, are my purposes merely carnal purposes, in order that my \"yes yes\" may be, as far as I am concerned, no better than \"no no\" - like the mere shifting feebleness of an aimless man? A fourth way of taking the clause, adopted by St. Chrysostom and many others, is, \"Do I plan after the flesh, i.e. with carnal obstinacy, so that my ' yea' and 'nay' must be carried out at all costs?' This suggestion can hardly be right; for St. Paul was charged, not with obstinacy, but with indecision. The phrases, \"yea\" and \"nay,\" as mentioned in Matthew 5:37 and James 5:12, throw no light on the passage, unless indeed some one had misquoted against St. Paul our Lord's words as a reason for adhering inviolably to a plan once formed. Of these various methods I adopt the first, because it seems to be, on the whole, most in accordance with the context. For on that view of the passage he contents himself with the remark that it cannot be inconsistency or levity on his part to alter plans which are liable to all the chance and change of ordinary circumstances; and then tells them that there was one part of his teaching which has nothing to do with mere human weakness, but was God's everlasting , \"yes;\" after which he explains to them the reason why he decided not to come to them until he had first visited Macedonia, and so to give them one visit, not two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - But as God is true; rather, but God is faithful, whatever man may be (1 Corinthians 1:9; 1 Corinthians 10:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:24; 2 Thessalonians 3:3; 1 John 1:9). Our word towards you, etc. The verse should be rendered, But God is faithful, because (faithful herein, that) our preaching to you proved itself to be not yea and may. Whatever you may say of my plans and my conduct, there was one thing which involved an indubitable \"yea,\" namely, my preaching to you. In that, at any rate, there was nothing capricious, nothing variable, nothing vacillating. St. Paul, in a manner characteristic to his moods of deepest emotion, \"goes off at a word.\" The Corinthians talked of his \"yea\" and \"nay\" as though one was little better than the other, and neither could be depended on; well, at any rate, one thing, and that the most essential, was as sure as the faithfulness of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For. This is a proof of what he has just said. His preaching was as firm as a rock; for, tried by time, it had proved itself a changeless\" yea,\" being a preaching of Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. By me and Silvanus and Timotheus. They are mentioned because they had been his companions in the first visit to Corinth (Acts 18:5), and he wishes to show that his preaching of Christ had never wavered. \"Silvanus\" (1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1) is the \"Silas\" of Acts 15:22. He disappears from the New Testament in this verse, unless he be the \"Silvanus\" of 1 Peter 5:12. Was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. \"Became not (proved not to be) yes and no (in one breath, as it were, and therefore utterly untrustworthy), but in him there has been a yea.\" The perfect, \"has become,\" means that in him the everlasting\" yes\" has proved itself valid, and still continues to be a changeless affirmation (Hebrews 13:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For all the promises of God in him are yea; rather, For so many as be the promises of God, in him is the yea. All the promises of God find in him their unchangeable fulfilment. He was \"a minister to confirm the promises\" alike to the Jews and the Gentiles (Romans 15:8, 9); and \"the premise of the eternal inheritance\" can only be fulfilled in him (Hebrews 9:15). And in him Amen. The true reading is,\" Wherefore by him also is the Amen to God, uttered by us to his glory\" (א, A, B, C, F, G, etc.). In Christ is the \"yea\" of immutable promise and absolute fulfilment; the Church utters the \"Amen\" of perfect faith and grateful adoration. Here, as in 1 Corinthians 14:16, we have a proof of the ancientness of the custom by which the congregation utters the \"Amen\" at the end of praise and prayer. But as the \"yea\" is in Christ, so it is only through him that we can receive the grace to utter aright the \"Amen\" to the glory of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Now he that stablisheth us. They will have seen, then, that steadfastness not levity, immutability not vacillation, has been the subject of their teaching. Who is the Source of that steadfastness? God, who anointed us and confirmed us, and you with us, into unity with his Anointed. With you. We partake alike of this Christian steadfastness; to impugn mine is to nullify your own. In Christ; rather, into Christ, so as to be one with him. They are already \"in Christo;\" they would aim more and more to be established \"in Christurn.\" Who anointed us. Every Christian is a king and priest to God, and has received an unction from the Holy One (1 John 2:20, 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Who hath also sealed us. We cannot be deconsecrated, disanointed. Still less can the confirming seal be broken. He continues to dwell on the conception of the unchangeableness of God and of the gospel into which he had been incidentally led by the charge of \"lightness.\" The earnest of the Spirit. The promises which we have received are not mere promises, they are already so far fulfilled to us and in us as to guarantee hereafter their plenary fruition. Just as in money bargains \"earnest money,\" \"money on account,\" is given, in pledge that the whole will be ultimately discharged, so we have \"the earnest of the Spirit\" (2 Corinthians 5:5), \"the firstfruits of the Spirit\" (Romans 8:23), which are to us \"the earnest\" or pledge money that we shall hereafter enter upon the purchased possession (Ephesians 1:13, 14). We now see the meaning of the \"and.\" It involves a climax - the promise is much; the unction more; the seal a still further security (Ephesians 4:30; 2 Timothy 2:19); but beyond all this we have already a part payment in the indwelling of the Present of God (Romans 5:5; Romans 8:9; Galatians 4:6). The word arrabon, rendered \"earnest,\" has an interesting history. It is very ancient, for it is found (עַרָבון) in Genesis 38:17, 18, and comes from a root meaning \"to pledge.\" It seems to be a Phoenician word, which had been introduced into various languages by the universality of Phoenician commerce. In classical Latin it is shortened into arrha, and it still exists in Italian as aura, in French as arrhes. The equivalent Hebrew figure is \"firstfruits\" (Romans 8:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Moreover I call God for a record; rather, But I call God for a witness. At this point, to 2 Corinthians 2:4, he enters for the first time on the kindly reasons which had led him to forego his intended earlier visit. He uses a similar adjuration in 2 Corinthians 11:31; and although these appeals (comp. 1 Corinthians 15:31; Romans 1:9; Galatians 1:20) may be due in part to the emotional fervour of his temperament, yet he would hardly have resorted to them in this self defence, if the calumnies of his enemies had not gained much credence. The French proverb, Qui s'excuse s'accuse, is often grossly abused. The refutation of lies and slanders is often a duty, not because they injure us, but because, by diminishing our usefulness, they may injure others. Upon my soul. Not \"to take vengeance on my soul if I lie,\" but to confirm the appeal of its honesty and integrity. By the use of such \"oaths for confirmation,\" St. Paul, no less than other apostles, shows that he understood our Lord's rule, \"Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay,\" as applying to the principle of simple and unvarnished truthfulness of intercourse, which requires no further confirmation; but not as a rigid exclusion of the right to appeal to God in solemn cases and for good reasons. To spare you. This postponement of the intended visit was a sign of .forbearance, for which they should have been grateful. After all that he had heard of them, if he had come at all, it could only have been \"with a rod\" (1 Corinthians 4:21). I came not as yet. The rendering is erroneous. It literally means \"I no longer came,\" i.e. I forbore to come as I had intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Not for that we have dominion over your faith. The expression, \"to spare you,\" might have been resented as involving a claim \"to lord it over their faith.\" He had, indeed, authority (1 Colossians 4:21; 2 Corinthians 10:6; 2 Corinthians 13:2, 10), but it was a purely spiritual authority; it was valid only over those who recognized in him an apostolic commission. St. Peter, no less than St. Paul, discourages the spirit of ecclesiastical tyranny (1 Peter 5:3). But are helpers of your joy. We are fellow-helpers of your Christian joy, and therefore I would not come to cause your grief. That was how I desired to spare you. The object of my visits is always \"for your furtherance and joy of faith\" (Philippians 1:25). For by faith ye stand. The expression is not a mere general principle, but explains his disclaimer of any desire \"to lord it over their faith.\" As far as their \"faith\" was concerned, they were not to blame; that remained unshaken, and was independent of any visit or authority of St. Paul. But while \"in respect of faith ye stand\" (Ephesians 6:13), there are other points in which you are being shaken, and in dealing with these I should have been obliged to take severe measures, which, if I postponed my visit, would (I hoped) become unnecessary.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - But I determined this. The division of chapters is here unfortunate, since this and the next three verses belong to the paragraph which began at 2 Corinthians 1:23. The verb means, literally, \"I judged,\" but is rightly rendered \"determined,\" as in 1 Corinthians 2:2; 1 Corinthians 7:37. He is contrasting his final decision with his original desire, mentioned in 2 Corinthians 1:15. With myself; rather, for myself; as the best course which I could take. That I would net come again to you in heaviness. The \"again\" in the true reading is not placed immediately before the verb, but it seems (as Theodoret says) to belong to it, so that the meaning is not \"that I would not pay you a second sad visit,\" but \"that my second visit to you should not be a sad one.\" There have been interminable discussions, founded on this expression and on ch. 13:1, as to whether St. Paul had up to the time of writing this letter visited Corinth twice or only once. There is no question that only one visit is recorded in the Acts (Acts 18:1-18) previous to the one which he paid to this Church after this Epistle had been sent (Acts 20:2, 3). If he paid them a second brief, sad, and unrecorded visit, it can only have been during his long stay in Ephesus (Acts 19:8, 10). But the possibility of this does not seem to be recognized in Acts 20:31, where he speaks of his work at Ephesus \"night and day\" during this period. The assumption of such a visit, as we shall see, is not necessitated by 2 Corinthians 13:1, but in any case we know nothing whatever about the details of the visit, even if there was one, and the question, being supremely unimportant, is hardly worth the time which has been spent upon it. If he had paid such a visit, it would be almost unaccountable that there should be no reference to it in the First Epistle, and here in 2 Corinthians 1:19 he refers only to one occasion on which he had preached Christ in Corinth. Each fresh review of the circumstances convinces me more strongly that the notion of three visits to Corinth, of which one is unrecorded, is a needless and mistaken inference, due to unimaginative literalism in interpreting one or two phrases, and encumbered with difficulties on every side. In heaviness. The expression applies as much to the Corinthians as to himself, he did not wish his second visit to Corinth to be a painful one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For if I make you sorry. The verse may be rendered. \"For if I pain you, who then is it that gladdens me except he who is being pained by me?\" The \"I\" being expressed in the original, is emphatic, and the verse has none of the strange selfish meaning which has been assigned to it, namely, that St. Paul thought \"the grief which he had caused to be amply compensated for by the pleasure he received from that grief.\" It has the much simpler meaning that he was unwilling to pain those who gladdened him, and therefore would not pay them a visit which could only be painful on both sides, when the normal relation between them should be one of joy on both sides, as he has already said (2 Corinthians 1:24). The singular, \"he who is being pained by me,\" does not refer to the offender, but to the Corinthians collectively. Who is he then, etc.? The \"then\" in the original is classically and elegantly expressed by καὶ, and (comp. James 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And I wrote this same unto you. And I wrote. He meets the tacit objection. If you shrink from causing us pain, why then did you write to us in terms so severe? The \"I wrote\" may be what is called the epistolary aorist, and will then be equivalent to our \"I write:\" \"What I write to you now has the very object of sparing you a painful visit.\" If the aorist has its more ordinary sense, it refers to the First, and not to the present Epistle; and this seems the better view, for the \"I wrote\" in ver. 9 certainly refers to the First Epistle. This same thing; namely, exactly what I have written (whether in this or in the former Epistle). The words, \"this very thing,\" may also, in the original, menu \"for this very reason,\" as in 2 Peter 1:5, and like the εἰς τοῦτο in ver. 9. Unto you. These words should be omitted, with א, A, B, C. When I came. The emphasis lies in these words. He preferred that his letter, rather than his personal visit, should cause pain. In you all. It is true that in the Corinthian Church St. Paul had bitter and unscrupulous opponents, but he will not believe even that they desired his personal unhappiness. At any rate, if there were any such, he will net believe that they exist, since \"love believeth all things, hopeth all things\" (1 Corinthians 13:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For. He proceeds to assign the anguish which his First Epistle had caused him as a proof of his confidence that, as a body, they loved him as he loved them. If they had regarded each other with indifference, his letter would not have been written to them, as it were. in his heart's blood. Out of much affliction and anguish of heart. The word for \"anguish\" means \"contraction,\" \"pressure,\" \"spasm\" (Luke 21:25). The expression may seem far too strong to be accounted for by the tone of the first letter. Hence some have supposed that he is referring to some other letter now last; and others that ch. 10-13. of this letter, where the whole tone of affection and tenderness suddenly changes into one of impassioned irony and indignation, really belonged to this intermediate letter. There is no need, however, for these hypotheses. In 1 Corinthians 5:1-6:11 he had spoken of the errors of the Church with strong reprobation, and the anguish with which he wrote the letter may have been all the more deeply felt because, in expressing it, he put on his feelings a strong restraint. With many tears. I wrote \"out of\" anguish, and that anguish showed itself through the tears which bathed my cheeks as I wrote. Such tears, says Calvin, \"show weakness, but a weakness more heroic than would have been the iron apathy of a Stoic.\" It must, however, be remembered that, in ancient times, and in Southern and Eastern lands, men yielded to tears more readily than among Northern nations, who take pride in suppressing as far as possible all outward signs of emotion. In Homer the bravest heroes do not blush to weep in public, and the nervous, afflicted temperament of St. Paul seems to have been often overwhelmed with weeping (Acts 20:19, 31; 2 Timothy 1:4). Not that ye should be grieved. The \"not,\" by a common Hebrew idiom, means \"not only,\" \"not exclusively.\" His object in inflicting pain was not the pain itself, but the results of godly repentance which it produced (2 Corinthians 7:11). The love. In the Greek this word is placed very emphatically at the beginning of the clause. More abundantly. I loved you more than I loved other converts, and the abundance of my love will give you a measure of the pain I felt. The Philippians were St. Paul's best-beloved converts; but next to them he seems to have felt more personal tenderness for the members of this inflated, wayward, erring Church than for any other community, just as a father sometimes loves best his least-deserving son. There was something in the brightness and keenness of the Greek nature which won over St. Paul, in spite of its many faults.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11. - The results of his letter in their treatment of the incestuous offender. Verse 5. - But if any have caused grief. The word \"pain\" or \"grief\" which has been so prominent in the last verses, naturally reminds St. Paul of the person whose misdoings had caused all this trouble. The \"any\" is in the singular. He hath not grieved me, but in part, etc. Of the various ways of taking this verse, the most tenable seems to be this: \"If any one has caused pain, he has not pained me but partly (not to weigh down too heavily) all of you. St. Paul is denying that the feelings with which he hat(written his severe letter were due to mere personal sorrow or indignation. In writing he felt for the wrong done to them, to the whole Corinthian Church, at least as much as for the smart of his own grief and disappointment. The word \"partly\" is introduced, as St. Chrysostom says, to soften the expression, \"he has grieved you all.\" It will then mean \"to a certain extent.\" The words, \"that I may not overcharge,\" or rather, as in the Revised Version, \"that I press not too heavily,\" assign the reason for the modifying clause, \"in part.\" When St. Paul says that this man's conduct had even to any extent grieved the whole community, his words may seem to conflict with 1 Corinthians 5:2; but he is thinking, not of the immediate condonation of the offender there alluded to, but of the agony of subsequent repentance which his letter had awoke in the whole (or practically the whole) community (2 Corinthians 7:11). The phrase, \"that I press not too heavily,\" refers then to the offender: \"I will not say outright that he has grieved not me, but all of you, because I do not wish to bear too hard on him\" (comp. 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8), \"but I will say that he has grieved you and me alike to some extent.\" The phrase, \"in part,\" occurs also in Romans 11:25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Sufficient to such a man is this punishment. What the punishment was we do not know, but of course the Corinthians knew that what St. Paul had directed them to do was to summon the Church together, and there,by excommunicating the man, \"to hand him over to Satan.\" But this handing over to Satan was, as we have seen, designed solely for a merciful purpose, and to awaken his repentance, so as to secure his ultimate salvation (1 Corinthians 5:4, 5). Whether the Corinthians had done exactly as St. Paul bade them is uncertain; but whatever they had done is here acquiesced in by St. Paul, and even if (as we may suspect) they had dealt more leniently with the offender than he originally intended, he here not only refrains from urging them to use greater severity, but even exhorts them to a still more absolute condonation. St. Paul's object had not been that they should take a particular course of action, but that they should bring about a desired result. The result had been achieved, and now the matter might rest. To such a man. St. Paul mercifully abstains from recording his name or from thrusting him into unnecessary prominence before the assembly in which the letter would be read. The apostle evidently entered into the Jewish feeling that there is a criminal cruelty in needlessly calling a blush of shame into a brother's face. This punishment. The word epitimia, which occurs here only in the New Testament, but is also found in Wisd. 3:10, means \"punishment,\" as in later Greek, and is not used in its classical sense of \"rebuke\" (Vulgate, objurgatio); but the mildness of the word, perhaps, implies that the Corinthians had not resorted to the severest measures. Which was inflicted of many; rather, by the majority. The verb is expressed in the original, and St. Paul seems to allude to the steps taken, whatever they were, with a certain dignified reticence. It is obvious that there were still some opponents of St. Paul in the Church, who retained in this matter their \"inflated\" sentiments of spurious independence; and this may, perhaps, have driven others into too rigid an attitude of severity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Contrariwise; i.e. contrary to the line taken or to the view expressed by the severer portion of the community. Rather. The word is omitted in A and B. To forgive him. The word is used of the mutual attitude of gracious forbearance which ought to exist among Christians(Forgiving one another,\" Ephesians 4:32; Colossians 3:13), so that they might be not only Christians, but as Gentiles ignorantly called them, Chrestians (\" kind-hearted,\" Ephesians 4:82). And comfort; i.e. \"strengthen,\" \"encourage.\" The \"him\" is emitted in the Greek, with the same delicate, compassionate reticence which leads St. Paul to speak of this person \"a man of such of a kind.\" In Galatians 6:11 St. Paul suddenly breaks off the course of his remarks to give similar advice in a tone of peculiar solemnity; and in 2 Thessalonians 3:15 he warns against any excess in the severity which he enjoins in the previous verse. Such a one. Like the indefinite \"one\" in 1 Corinthians 5:5. In the Greek it is compassionately placed last in the clause. Should be swallowed up. The same metaphor, of being swallowed in an abyss, occurs in 1 Corinthians 15:54. In 1 Peter 5:8 it is said that Satan is ever striving to \"swallow up\" men. With overmuch sorrow; rather, with the, or his, excessive grief.

In the original there is a conjunction, \"but.\" It would, perhaps, be pressing it too much to imply that their \"forgiveness\" showed that they had not accurately stood the test of perfect obedience; yet it is difficult to read the whole passage without suspecting that St. Paul, while by temperament he leaned to the side of mercy, is here showing a spirit of generous self-suppression m accepting the course which the Corinthians had followed, although it had, in some way or other, diverged from his exact directions. To whom, Obviously, again, a purposely indefinite reference to the incestuous person. I forgive also. The power of \"binding\" and \"loosing,\" of \"forgiving\" and \"retaining,\" had only been given to the apostles representatively and collectively, and therefore to the Christian Church (John 20:23) in its corporate capacity. The Corinthian Church had in this case decided to forgive, and St. Paul ratifies their decision. For if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it. The reading here varies between ὅ, what, and ω΅, to whom, which in dictation might be easily confused. The order of the words also varies. The best reading seems to be expressed by the version, \"For what I also have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything (I have pardoned it) for your sakes.\" This represents the reading of א, A, B, C, F, G, etc., and is followed by the Revised Version. There seems to be here an intentional vagueness, and reference to circumstances of which we are not informed, which might, perhaps, have given room for wounded feelings in any one less magnanimous than St. Paul. The line he took in this matter was taken for their sakes - that is all he says, he adopted it as the best relatively, whether it was absolutely the best or not. In the person of Christ; literally, in the face of Christ; which seems to mean \"in the presence of Christ,\" as though he were looking on at what I did (comp. 2 Corinthians 1:11; 2 Corinthians 3:7, 13, 18; 2 Corinthians 4:6). It may be doubted whether the word prosopon ever means \"person\" in the New Testament, except in a secondary sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Lest Satan should get an advantage over us; literally, lest we should be overreached by Satan, which would have been the case if our severity had resulted in the desperation of the offender, and not in his deliverance (comp. 1 Corinthians 5:5).

So too in Ephesians 6:11 we are told of the \"crafty wiles of the devil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFurthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - Outburst of thanksgiving for the news brought by Titus.' Verse 12. - Furthermore, when I came to Troas. \"Furthermore\" is too strong for the \"but\" of the original. There is an apparently abrupt transition, but the apostle is only resuming the narrative which he broke off at ver. 4 in order that he might finish the topic of the painful circumstance in which his First Epistle had originated. To Troas. Not \"the Troas.\" St. Paul had to do with the city, not with the district. The city (now Eski Stamboul), of which the name had been changed from Antigonia Troas to Alexandria Troas, was at this time a flourishing colony (Colonia Juris Italici), highly favoured by the Romans as representing ancient Troy, and therefore as being the mythological cradle of their race. He visited it on his being driven from Ephesus after the tumult, a little earlier than he would naturally have left it. He had visited Troas in his second missionary journey (Acts 16:8-11), but had left it in consequence of the vision which called him to Macedonia. He now stopped there on his journey through Macedonia to Corinth, which he had announced in 1 Corinthians 16:5. And a door was opened unto me of the Lord; literally, and a door had been opened to me in the Lord; i.e. and I found there a marked opportunity (1 Corinthians 16:9) for work in Christ. Some commentators, in that spirit of superfluous disquisition and idle letter-worship which is the bane of exegesis, here venture to discuss whether St. Paul was justified in neglecting this opportunity or not. Such discussions are only originated by not observing characteristic modes of expression. St. Paul merely means\" circumstances would otherwise have been very favourable for my preaching of Christ; but I was in such a state of miserable anxiety that I lacked the strength to avail myself of them.\" He was no more responsible for this state of mind, which belonged to his natural temperament, than he would have been responsible for a serious illness. To say that he ought to have had strength of mind enough to get the mastery over his feelings is only to say that Paul ought not to have been Paul. The neglect to use the opportunity was a \"hindrance\" which might in one sense be assigned to God, and in another to Satan. Moreover, that the opportunity was not wholly lost appears from the fact that St. Paul found a flourishing Christian community at Troas when he visit, d it on his return from this very journey (Acts 20:6, 7), and that he stayed there at least once again, shortly before his martyrdom (2 Timothy 4:13). Indeed, it was probably at Troas that his final arrest took place (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:569, 576). Of the Lord; rather, in the Lord; i.e. in the sphere of Christian work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I had; literally, I have had. The perfect vividly realizes the scene through which he had passed. I had no rest. St. Paul had evidently told Titus to come from his mission to Corinth and meet him at Troas. But either St. Paul reached the town earlier than he intended, or Titus had been delayed. Now, the apostle was so intensely eager to know how his rebukes had been received - the name of \"Corinth\" was so deeply engraven on his heart - he could so ill endure the thought of being on angry terms with converts which he so deeply loved, that the non-appearance of Titus filled him with devouring anxiety and rendered him incapable of any other work. In my spirit; rather, to my spirit. It was the loftiest part of St. Paul's nature - his spirit - which was utterly incapacitated from effort by the restlessness of his miserable uncertainty about the Corinthian Church. The disclosure of such feelings ought to have had a powerful influence on the Corinthians. We see from 1 Thessalonians 3:5, 9 that St. Paul yearned for tidings of his converts with an intensity which can hardly be realized by less fervent and self-devoted natures. I found not Titus my brother. Not only \"the brother,\" but \"my brother;\" the man whom in matters of this kind I most trusted as an affectionate and able fellow worker (2 Corinthians 7:6; 2 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 12:18). Titus, though not mentioned in the Acts, is the most prominent person in this Epistle, and it is evident that St. Paul felt for him a warm affection and respect (2 Corinthians 7:13, 15; 2 Corinthians 8:16, 17; 2 Timothy 4:10). Taking my leave of them; i.e. of the Christians in Troas. The word for \"taking leave\" is also found in Mark 6:46. Into Macedonia. As he had intended to do (1 Corinthians 16:5; Acts 20:1). He had doubtless told Titus to look out for him at Philippi, and expected to meet him there on his way to Troas.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Now thanks be unto God. The whole of this Epistle is the apostle's Apologia pro vita sua, and is more full of personal details and emotional expressions than any other Epistle. But nothing in it is more characteristic than this sudden outburst of thanksgiving into which he breaks so eagerly that he has quite omitted to say what it was for which he so earnestly thanked God. It is only when we come to 2 Corinthians 7:5, 6 that we learn the circumstance which gave him such intense relief, namely, the arrival of Titus with good news from Corinth about the treatment of the offender and the manner in which the first letter had been received. It is true that this good news seems to have been dashed by other remarks of Titus which, perhaps, he withheld at first, and which may only have been drawn from him, almost against his will, by subsequent conversations. But, however checkered, the main and immediate intelligence was good, and the apostle so vividly recalls his sudden uplifting out of an abyss of anxiety and trouble (2 Corinthians 7:5) that the mere remembrance of it awakens a thankfulness to God which can only find vent by immediate utterance. Now thanks be unto God. The order of the original is more forcible, \"But to God be thanks.\" The remembrance of his own prostration calls into his mind the power and love of God. Which always causeth us to triumph; rather, who leadeth us in triumph. The verb thriambeuo may undoubtedly have this meaning, on the analogy of choreuo, I cause to dance, basileuo, I cause to reign, etc.; and other neuter verbs which sometimes have a factitive scribe. But in Colossians 2:15 St. Paul uses this word in the only sense in which it is actually found, \"to lead in triumph;\" and this sense seems both to suit the context better, and to be more in accordance with the habitual feelings of St. Paul (Galatians 6:17; Colossians 1:24), and especially those with which these Epistles were written (1 Corinthians 4:9-13; 2 Corinthians 4:10; 2 Corinthians 11:23). St. Paul's feeling is, therefore, the exact opposite of that of the haughty Cleopatra who said, Οὑ θριαμβευθήσομαι, \"I will not be led in triumph.\" He rejoiced to be exhibited by God as a trophy in the triumphal procession of Christ. God, indeed, gave him the victory over the lower part of his nature (Romans 8:37), but this was no public triumph. The only victory of which he could boast was to have been utterly vanquished by God and taken prisoner \"in Christ.\" The savour of his knowledge. The mental vision of a Roman triumph summons up various images before the mind of St. Paul. He thinks of the streets breathing with the fragrance of incense offered upon many a wayside altar; of the tumult and rejoicing of the people; of the fame and glory of the conqueror; of the miserable captives led aside from the funeral procession to die, like Vercingetorix, in the Tullianum at the foot of the Capitoline hill. He touches on each of these incidents as they crowd upon him. The triumph of L. Mummius over the conquest of Corinth had been one of the most splendid which the Roman world had ever seen, and in A.D. , shortly before this Epistle was written (A.D. 57), Claudius had celebrated his triumph over the Britons and their king Caractacus, who had been led in the procession, but whose life had been spared (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 13:36). The savour of his knowledge; i.e. the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ. By us. The details of the metaphor are commingled, as is often the case in writers of quick feeling and imagination. Here the apostles are no longer the vanquished who are led in procession, but the spectators who burn and diffuse the fragrance of the incense. In every place. Even at that early period, not twenty-five years after the Crucifixion, the gospel had been very widely preached in Asia and Europe (Romans 15:18, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ. The undeveloped metaphor involved in these words is that \"we and our preaching diffuse to God's glory the knowledge of Christ which is as a sweet savour.\" The apostles are identified with their work; they were as the incense, crushed and burned, but diffusing everywhere a waft of perfume. St. Paul is still thinking of the incense burnt in the streets of Rome during a triumph - \"Dabimusque Divis Tura benignis\" (Horace, 'Od.,' 4:2.51) - though his expression recalls the \"odour of a sweet smell,\" of Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17 (comp. Ephesians 5:2); see on this passage the excellent note of Bishop Wordsworth. In them that are saved, and in them that perish; rather, among those who are perishing and those who are being saved (comp. Acts 2:47). The odour is fragrant to God, though those who breathe it may be variously affected by it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The savour of death unto death; rather, a savour from death to death. To those who are perishing, the incense of the Name of Christ which our work enables them to breathe, seems to rise from death, and to lead to death. They (for here again the outlines of the metaphor shift) are like the doomed captives, who, as they breathed the incense on the day of triumph, knew where that triumph would lead them before the victors can climb the Capitol. To them it would seem to bring with it not \"airs from heaven,\" but wafts from the abyss. So Christ was alike for the fall and for the rising again of many (Luke 2:34). To some he was a Stone of stumbling (Acts 4:11; Romans 9:33; 1 Peter 2:8), which grinds to powder those on whom it falls (Matthew 21:44). This contrast between the intended effect of the gospel as the power and wisdom of God, and its accidental effect, through man's sin and blindness which converts it into a source of judgment, is often alluded to in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 1:18, 23, 24; John 3:19; John 9:39; John 15:22, etc.). St. Paul is fond of intensified expressions, like \"from death unto death,\" as in Romans 1:17; \"from faith to faith,\" etc. (2 Corinthians 4:17). Savour of life unto life; rather, a savour from life, as before. It came from the Source of life; it is issued in the sole reality of life. Similarly the rabbis spoke of the Law as \"an aroma\" alike of death and of life. \"Why are the words of the Law likened to princes (Proverbs 8:6)? Because, like princes, they have the power to kill and to give life. Rays said to those that walk on its right, the Law is a medicine of life; to those that walk on the left side, a medicine of death\" ('Shabbath,' f. 88, 2; 'Yoma,' f. 72, 2) Everything is as a two-edged sword. All Christian privileges are, as they are used, either blessings or banes (Wordsworth). And who is sufficient for these things? St. Paul always implies that nothing but the grace of God could enable him to discharge the great duty laid upon him (2 Corinthians 3:5, 6; 1 Corinthians 15:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For we are not as many; rather, as the many. This clause is introduced to show how much courage and effort the work requires. \"The many\" might, by Greek idiom, mean \"the majority.\" The apparent harshness of the assertion that the majority of teachers in the apostolic age dealt untruly with the Word of God, led to the substitution of οἱ λοιποὶ, the rest, in some manuscripts (D, E, F, G, L). But \"the many\" here means \"the many antagonists of mine,\" who preach a different gospel (Galatians 1:6). It must be remembered that conceit, Pharisaism, moral laxity, and factions were all at work in the Corinthian Church. Which corrupt. The Word means who are merely\" trafficking with,\" \"adulterating,\" \"huckstering,\" the Word of life. The word occurs in the LXX. of Isaiah 1:22; Ecclus. 26:29; and Plato applies the same metaphor to the sophists, who peddle their wisdom about ('Protag.,' p. 313 d). The substantive kapelos means \"a retail dealer,\" and especially a vintner, and the verb kapeleuo is always used in a bad sense, like the English \"to huckster.\" Such deceitful dealers with the gospel are described in 2 Peter 2:3, and in one of the Ignatian letters they are called Christemporoi, Christ-traffickers. Such were those who altered the perspective of the gospel, lowered its standard, and adulterated it with strange admixtures. Their methods and their teaching are constantly alluded to in these Epistles (1 Corinthians 1:17, 31; 1 Corinthians 2:1-4; and 2 Corinthians 10:12, 15; 2 Corinthians 11:13-15, etc.), But as of sincerity, but as of God. lake one who speaks from the sincerity of his heart (2 Corinthians 1:12; 2 Corinthians 4:2) and by the inspiration of God (1 Corinthians 14:25).

Verse 1. - Do we begin again to commend ourselves? The last verse of the last chapter might be seized upon by St. Paul's opponents to renew their charge - that he was always praising himself. He anticipates the malignant and meaning smiles with which they would hear such words. The word \"again\" implies that this charge had already been brought against him, perhaps in consequence of such passages as 1 Corinthians 2:16; 1 Corinthians 3:10; 1 Corinthians 4:11-14; 1 Corinthians 9:15-23; 1 Corinthians 14:18, etc. Such passages might be called self-laudatory and egotistical, were it not that (as St. Paul here explains) they arose only from a sense of the grandeur of his office, of which he was the almost involuntary agent, used by God as it seemed best to him. Hence he says later on (2 Corinthians 7:18) that self-praise is no commendation, and that the true test of a man is God's commendation. The verb \"I commend,\" technically used in the same sense as our \"commendatory letters,\" occurs also in Romans 16:1. Or need we, etc.? The reading, η} μὴ, thus translated, is better supported than εἰ μὴ, unless, which would have a somewhat ironical force. The μὴ in the reading η} μὴ implies, \"Can you possibly think that we need,\" etc.? Generally, when a stranger came to some Church to which he was not personally known, he carried with him some credentials in the form of letters from accredited authorities. St. Paul treats it as absurd to suppose that he or Timothy should need such letters, either from the Corinthians or to them. As some. He will not name them, but he refers to the Judaists, who vaunted of their credentials in order to disparage St. Paul, who was too great to need and too independent to use them. We can hardly, perhaps, realize the depth and bitterness of antagonism concealed under that word \"some\" in 1 Corinthians 4:18 Galatians 1:7; Galatians 2:12. It is not meant that there was anything discreditable in using such letters (for Apollos had used them, Acts 18:27), but the disgraceful thing was that St. Paul should be disparaged for not bringing them. Epistles of commendation. The phrase, ἐπιστολαὶ συστατικαί ( \"introductory letters\" - was familiar in later Greek. In days when there were few public hostels, and when it was both a duty and a necessity for small and persecuted communities like those of the Jews and Christians to practise hospitality (Romans 12:13; Hebrews 13:2. etc.), it was customary both for synagogues and Churches to provide their friends and emissaries with authentic testimonials. Otherwise they might have been deceived by wandering impostors, as, in fact, the Christians were deceived by the vagabond quack Peregrinus. We can easily see how the custom of using such letters might be abused by idle, restless, and intriguing persons, who have never found it very difficult to procure them. We find traces of their honest use by Phoebe, by Silas and Jude, by Apollos, by Mark, and by Zenas, in Romans 16:1; Acts 18:27; Acts 15:25; Colossians 4:10; Titus 3:13; and of their unfair use by certain Judaists, in Galatians 1:7 and Galatians 2:12. Nothing can more forcibly illustrate the necessity for St. Paul's protest against the idle vaunt of possessing such letters, than the fact that, more than a century afterwards, we find malignant innuendoes aimed at St. Paul in the pseudo-Clementines, under the name of\" the enemy\" and \"Simon Magus\" and \"a deceiver.\" He is there spoken of as using letters from the high priest (which, indeed, St. Paul had done as Saul of Tarsus, Acts 9:1, 2); and the Churches are warned never to receive any one who cannot bring credentials from James; so deep-rooted among the Judaists was the antagonism to the independent apostolate and daring originality of the apostle of the Gentiles! Dr. Plumptre quotes Sozomen ('H.E.', 5:16) for the curious fact that the Emperor Julian tried to introduce the system of \"commendatory letters\" into his revived paganism. Or letters of commendation from you. The substitution of \"letters\" for \"epistles\" is an instance of the almost childish fondness for unnecessary synonyms, which is one of the defects of the Authorized Version. The true reading probably is \"to you or from you\" (א, A, B, C). The word \"commendatory\" (sustatikon) is omitted in A, B, C. Or from you. It was worse than absurd to suppose that St. Paul should need those literae formatae to a Church of which he was the thunder; and nothing but the boundless \"inflation\" which characterized the Corinthians could have led them to imagine that he needed letters from them to other Churches, as though, forsooth, they were the primary Church or the only church (1 Corinthians 14:36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Ye are our epistle.

Written in our hearts. The expression has no connection with the fact that the high priest bore the names of Israel graven on the jewelled Urim, which he wore upon his breast. St. Paul means that others may bring their \"letters of commendation\" in their hands. His letter of commendation is the very name and existence of the Church of Corinth written on his heart. Known and read of all men. The metaphor is subordinated to the fact. All men may recognize the autograph, and in it were read the history of the Corinthian converts, which was written on the apostle's heart, and which therefore rendered the notion of any other letter of commendation to or from them superfluous and even absurd. The play on words (epigignosko and anagignosko) is similar to that in 2 Corinthians 1:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Manifestly declared. The fame and centrality of Corinth gave peculiar prominence to the fact of their conversion. The epistle of Christ ministered by us. The Corinthians are the epistle; it is written on the hearts of St. Paul and his companions; Christ was its Composer; they were its amanuenses and its conveyers. The development of the metaphor as a metaphor would be somewhat clumsy and intricate, but St. Paul only cares to shadow forth the essential fact which he wishes them to recognize. Not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; i.e. not with visible or perishable materials, but spiritual in its origin and character. The notion of \"the finger of God\" naturally recalled the notion of \"the Spirit of God\" (comp. Matthew 12:28 with Luke 11:20). Not in tables of stone. God's writing by means of the Spirit on the heart reminds him of another writing of God on the stone tablets of the Law, which he therefore introduces with no special regard to the congruity of the metaphor about \"an epistle.\" But in fleshy tables of the heart. The overwhelming preponderance of manuscript authority supports the reading \"but in fleshen tablets - hearts.\" St. Paul is thinking of Jeremiah 31:33, \"I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\" and Ezekiel 11:22, \"I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh.\" The tablets were not hard and fragile, but susceptible and receptive. Our letters of introduction are inward not outward, spiritual not material, permanent not perishable, legible to all not only by a few, written by Christ not by man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Such trust. The confidence, namely, that we need no other recommendation to or from you. Through Christ. Who alone can inspire such confidence in myself and my mission (1 Corinthians 15:10). To God-ward; i.e. in relation to God; towards whom the whole Being of Christ is directed (John 1:1), and therefore all the work of his servants (Romans 5:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Not that we are sufficient of ourselves. He here reverts to the question asked in 2 Corinthians 2:16. He cannot bear the implication that any \"confidence\" on his part rests on anything short of the overwhelming sense that he is but an agent, or rather nothing but an instrument, in the hands of God. To think anything as of ourselves. He has, indeed, the capacity to form adequate judgments about his work, but it does not come from his own resources (ἀφ ἑαυτῶν) or his own independent origination (ἐξ ἑαυτῶν); comp. 1 Corinthians 15:10. But our sufficiency. Namely, to form any true or right judgment, and therefore to express the confidence which I have expressed. Is of God. We are but fellow workers with him (1 Corinthians 3:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Who also. Either, \"And he it is who;\" or, \"Who besides this power, has made us adequate ministers.\" Hath made us able ministers; rather, made us sufficient ministers. Of the new testament; rather, of a fresh covenant (Jeremiah 31:31). The \"new testament\" has not the remotest connection with what we call \"The New Testament,\" meaning thereby the book - which, indeed, had at this time no existence. The word \"testament\" means a will, and in this sense implies neither the Hebrew berith nor the Greek diatheke, both of which mean \"covenant.\" In one passage only of the New Testament (Hebrews 9:16, 17) does diatheke mean a \"testament\" or \"will.\" For the thought, see Ephesians 3:7; Colossians 1:25; 1 Timothy 1:11, 12. Not of the letter, but of the spirit. In other words, \"not of the Law, but of the gospel;\" not of that which is dead, but of that which is living; not of that which is deathful, but of that which is life-giving; not of bondage, but of freedom; not of mutilation, but of self-control; not of the outward, but of the inward; not of works, but of grace; not of menace, but of promise; not of curse, but of blessing; not of wrath, but of love; not of Moses, but of Christ. This is the theme which St. Paul develops especially in the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians (see Romans 2:29; Romans 3:20; Romans 7:6, 10, 11; Romans 8:2; Galatians 3:10; Galatians 5:4, etc.). Not of the letter. Not, that is, of the Mosaic Law regarded as a yoke of externalism; a hard and unhelpful \"thou shalt\" and \"thou shalt not;\" a system that possessed no life of its own and inspired no life into others; a \"categoric imperative,\" majestic, indeed, but unsympathetic and pitiless. Both the Law and the gospel were committed to writing; each covenant had its own book; but in the case of the Mosaic Law there was the book and nothing more; in the case of the gospel the book was nothing compared to the spirit, and nothing without the spirit. Out of the spirit. That is, of the gospel which found its pledge and consummation in the gift of the Spirit. The Law, too, was in one sense \"spiritual\" (Romans 7:14), for it was given by God, who is a Spirit, and it was a holy Law; but though such in itself (in se) it was relatively (per aceidens) a cause of sin and death, because it was addressed to a fallen nature, and inspired no spirit by which that nature could be delivered (see Romans 7:7-25). But in the gospel the spirit is everything; the mere letter is as nothing (John 6:63). For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. This is one of the very numerous \"texts\" which have been first misinterpreted and have then been made, for whole centuries, the bases of erroneous systems. On this text more than any other, Origen, followed by the exegetes of a thousand years, built his dogma that the Scripture must be interpreted allegorically, not literally, because \"the letter\" of the Bible kills. The misinterpretation is extravagantly inexcusable, and, like many others, arose solely from rending words away from their context and so reading new senses into them. The contrast is not between \"the outward\" and the inward sense of Scripture at all. \"The letter\" refers exclusively to \"the Law,\" and therefore has so little reference to \"the Bible\" that it was written before most of the New Testament existed, and only touches on a small portion of the Old Testament. Killeth. Two questions arise.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) What and whom does it kill? andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) how does it kill?NEWLINENEWLINEThe answers seem to be thatNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the letter - the Law regarded as an outward letter - passes the sentence of death on those who disobey it. It says, \"He who doeth these things shall live in them;\" and therefore implies, as well as often says, that he who disobeys them shall be cut off. It is, therefore, a deathful menace. For none can obey this Law with perfect obedience. AndNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the sting of death being sin, the Law kills by directly leading to sin, in that it stirs into existence the principle of concupiscence (Romans 7:7-11; 1 Corinthians 15:56; Galatians 3:10, 21). But the spirit giveth life. This contrast between a dead and a living covenant is fundamental, and especially in the writings of St. Paul (Romans 2:27-29; Romans 7:6; Romans 8:11; Galatians 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:45). The Law stones the adulteress; the gospel says to her, \"Go, and sin no more.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The ministration of death. The ministration, that is, of the Law, of \"the letter which killeth.\" St. Paul here begins one of the arguments a minori ad majus which are the very basis of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Written and engraven in stones; literally, engraved in letters on stones (Exodus 31:18). The reference shows that, in speaking of \"the letter,\" St. Paul was only thinking of the Mosaic Law, and indeed specifically of the Decalogue. Was glorious; literally, occurred in glory, or, proved itself glorious. In itself the Law was \"holy, just, and good\" (Romans 7:12), and given \"at the disposition of angels\" (Acts 7:53); and its transitory glory was illustrated by the lustre which the face of Moses caught by reflection from his intercourse with God (Exodus 24:16). Could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses (Exodus 34:29, 30). St. Paul has been led quite incidentally into this digression in the course of defending himself by describing the nature of his ministry; but it bore very definitely on his general purpose, because his chief opponents were Judaists, whose one aim it was to bind upon the Church the yoke of Mosaism. That they could not \"behold\" the face of Moses is the hagadah, or traditional legend, derived from Exodus 34:30, which says that \"they were afraid to draw nigh to him. The reader may recall the beautiful lines of Cardinal Newman-NEWLINENEWLINE\"Lord l grant me this abiding grace -NEWLINEThy words and saints to know;NEWLINETo pierce the veil on Moses' face,NEWLINEAlthough his words be slow.\" Because of the glory of his countenance. This circumstance is so often alluded to as to have become identified with the conception of Moses. The Hebrew words for \"a ray of light\" and \"a horn\" are identical; hence, instead of saying that his face was \"irradiated,\" the Vulgate says, Cornnta erat ejus facies; and even in our version of Habakkuk 3:4 we find \"And he had horns [i.e. 'rays of light'] coming out of his hand.\" To this is due the mediaeval symbol of Moses with horns, as in the matchless statue by Michael Angelo. Which glory was to be done away. The Greek might be expressed by \"the glory - the evanescing glory - of his countenance.\" It was not \"to be done away,\" but from the first moment they saw it it began to vanish. The verb \"to do away,\" implying annulment, and the being abrogated as invalid, is a characteristic word in this group cf Epistles, in which it occurs twenty-two times. This illustrates the prominence in St. Paul's thoughts of the fact that the Law was now \"antiquated\" and \"near its obliteration\" (comp. Hebrews 8:13). But in dwelling on the brief and transient character of this radiance, St. Paul seizes on a point which (naturally) is not dwelt upon in Exodus 34.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The ministration of the spirit. That is, \"the apostolate and service of the gospel.\" Be rather glorious. A contrast may be intended between the ministration of the letter, which \"became glorious,\" which had, as it were, a glory lent to it (ἐγενήθη ἐν δόξῃ), and that of the spirit, which is, of its own nature, in glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The ministration of condemnation. The same antithesis between the Law as involving \"condemnation\" and the gospel as bestowing \"righteousness\" is found in Romans 5:18, 19. The glory; perhaps, rather, a glory; a stronger way of describing it as \"glorious.\" Of righteousness. Involving the further conception of \"justification,\" as in Romans 5:21; Romans 1:16, 17; Romans 4:25; Romans 5:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For. He proceeds to show that the latter ministration was far more superabundant in glory. That which was made glorious, etc. Many various interpretations have been offered of this text. The meaning almost undoubtedly is, \"For even that which has been glorified [namely, the Mosaic ministry, as typified by the splendour of his face] has not been glorified in this respect [i.e. in the respect of its relation to another ministry], because of the surpassing glory [of the latter].\" In other words, the glory of Mosaism is so completely outdazzled by the splendour of the gospel, that, relatively speaking, it has no glory left; the moon and the stars cease to shine, they \"pale their ineffectual fires\" when the sun is in the zenith. The phrase, \"in this respect,\" occurs again in 2 Corinthians 9:3 and 1 Peter 4:16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For. An explanation of the \"surpassing\" glory of the later covenant founded on its eternity. That which is done away; rather, that which is evanescing; \"which is being done away,\" as in ver. 7. Was glorious... is glorious. The expression is varied in the Greek. The brief, the evanescent covenant was \"through glory,\" i.e. it was a transitory gleam; the abiding covenant is \"in glory;\" i.e. it is an eternal splendour. It is, however, a disputed point whether St. Paul intended such rigid meanings to be attached to his varying prepositions (Romans 3:30, ἐκ πίστες... διὰ τῆς πίστεως: 5:10, διὰ τοῦ θανάτου ἐν τῇ ζωῇ: Galatians 2:16, ἐξ ἔργων... διὰ πίστεως: Philemon 1:5, πρός τὸν Κύριον... εἰς τοὺς ἁγιους). That which remaineth. The final, eternal, unshakable gospel (Hebrews 12:27). Is glorious; literally, is in glory. Christ is eternally the Light of the world (John 1:9; John 9:5); and Moses and Elias derived all their permanence of glory by reflection from this transfiguring light.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-18. - The confidence inspired by this ministry and the veil on the hearts of those who will not recognize it. Verse 12. - Such hope. A hope based upon the abiding glory of this gospel covenant. Plainness of speech. The frankness and unreserved fearlessness of our language is justified by the glory of our ministry. It was impossible for Moses to speak with the same bold plainness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And not as Moses. We need not act, as Moses was obliged to do, by putting any veil upon our faces while we speak. And here the image of \"the veil\" as completely seizes St. Paul's imagination as the image of the letter does in the first verses. Put a veil; literally, was putting, or, used to put, a veil on his face when he had finished speaking to the people. That the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished; rather, that the children of Israel might not gaze on the end of what was passing away. The object of the veil, according to St. Paul, was to prevent the Israelites from gazing on the last gleam of the covenant. In other words, he did not wish them to be witnesses of a fading glory. It is preposterous to imagine that St. Paul is here casting any blame on the conduct of Moses, as though he acted fraudulently or delusively. Moses was aware, and even told the people, float his legislation was not final (Deuteronomy 18:15 -19), but it would be quite natural that he should not wish the people to witness the gradual dimming of the lustre which, in St. Paul's view, was typical of that transitoriness. It seems, however, that St. Paul is here eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) following a different reading or rendering of Exodus 34:33; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) is adopting some Jewish hagadah; orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) is giving his own turn to the narrative, as the rabbis habitually did, by way of midrash, or exposition. For from the narrative of Exodus we should not gather that it was the object of Moses to hide the disappearance of the splendour, but rather to render the light endurable. In our Authorized Version the verse runs, \"till Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face;\" but the meaning of the original may be, \"after he had done speaking with them,\" as the LXX. takes it and the Vulgate. The end. To interpret this of Christ, because of Romans 10:4, is an instance of the superstitious and unintelligent way in which systems are made out of a mosaic of broken texts. The foolish character of the interpretation is shown when we consider that it involves the inference that Moses put a veil on his face in order to prevent the Israelites from seeing Christi But this attempt to illustrate Scripture by catching at a similar, expression applied in a wholly different way in another part of Scripture, is one of the normal follies of scriptural interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Their minds. This word is rendered\" devices\" in 2 Corinthians 2:11; \"minds\" in 2 Corinthians 3:14 and 2 Cor 4:4; and \"thought\" in 2 Corinthians 10:5. It means that their powers of reason were, so to speak, petrified. Were blinded; rather, were hardened. The verb cannot mean\" to blind.\" By whom were their minds hardened? It would be equally correct to say by themselves (Hebrews 3:8), or by Satan (2 Corinthians 4:4), or by God (Romans 11:7, 8). The same veil. Of course the meaning is \"a veil of which the veil of Moses is an exact type.\" The veil which prevented them from seeing the evanescence of the light which shone on the face of Moses was symbolically identical with that which prevented them also from seeing the transitory character of his Law. It had been as it were taken from his face and laid on their hearts (see Acts 13:27-29; Romans 11.). Many commentators have seen in this verse a reference to the Jewish custom of covering the head with the tallith, a four-cornered veil, when they were in the synagogues. But this is doubtful, since the tallith did not cover the eyes. More probably his metaphor may have been suggested by Isaiah 25:7, \"And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast ever all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.\" Untaken away. There are two other ways of rendering this verse:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"For until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted; which veil is done away in Christ,\" as in the Revised Version; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"The same veil remaineth, it not being revealed that it is done away in Christ,\" as it is taken by Chrysostom and many others, and in the margin of the Revised Version. The latter seems to be the better view. It is not the veil, but the old covenant, which is being done away in Christ. To the Jews that truth still remained under a veil. The present tense, \"is in course of annulment,\" might naturally be used until the utter abrogation of even the possible fulfilment of the Mosaic Law at the fall of Jerusalem. In the reading of the old testament; rather, the old covenant. There is no allusion to the Old Testament as a book, but the phrase is equivalent to \"Moses is read\" in the next verse. (On this obduracy of the Jews, see Romans 11:7, 8, 25.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - When Moses is read (Acts 15:21). The veil; rather, a veil; a veil of moral obstinacy, which prevents them from seeing the disappearance of the old covenant, as effectually as the veil on the face of Moses prevented them from seeing (as St. Paul viewed the matter) the disappearance of the transitory lustre on the face of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - When it shall turn to the Lord. The nominative of the verb is not expressed. Obviously the most natural word to supply is the one last alluded to, namely, \"the heart of Israel.\" The verb may have been suggested by Exodus 34:31. Shall be taken away; literally, is in course of removal. The tenses imply that \"the moment the heart of Israel shall have turned to the Lord, the removal of the veil begins.\" Then \"they shall look on him whom they pierced\" (Zechariah 12:10); \"He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations\" (Isaiah 25:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Now the Lord is that Spirit. The \"but\" (Authorized Version, \"now\") introduces an explanation. To whom shall they turn? To the Lord. \"But the Lord is the Spirit.\" The word \"spirit\" could not be introduced thus abruptly and vaguely; it must refer to something already said, and therefore to the last mention of the word \"spirit\" in ver. 3. The Lord is the Spirit, who giveth life and freedom, in antithesis to the spirit of death and legal bondage (see ver. 6; and comp. 1 Corinthians 15:45). The best comment on the verse is Romans 8:2, \"For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.\" All life and all religion had become to St. Paul a vision of all things in Christ. He has just said that the spirit giveth life, and, after the digression about the moral blindness which prevented the Jews from being emancipated from the bondage of the letter, it was quite natural for him to add, \"Now the Lord is the Spirit to which I alluded.\" The connection in which the verse stands excludes a host of untenable meanings which have been attached to it. There is liberty. The liberty of confidence (ver. 4), and of frank speech (ver. 12), and of sonship (Galatians 4:6, 7), and of freedom from guilt (John 8:36); so that the Law itself, obeyed no longer in the mere letter but also in the spirit, becomes a royal law of liberty, and not a yoke which gendereth to bondage (James 1:25; James 2:12) - a service, indeed, but one which is perfect freedom (Romans 5:1-21; 1 Peter 2:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - But we all. An appeal to personal experience in evidence of the freedom. With open face; rather, with unveiled face; as Moses himself spoke with God, whereas the Jews could not see even the reflected splendour on the face of Moses till he had shrouded it with a veil. Beholding as in a glass. This is at least as likely to be the true meaning as \"reflecting as a mirror,\" which the Revised Version (following Chrysostom and others) has substituted for it. No other instance occurs in which the verb in the middle voice has the meaning of \"reflecting,\" and the words, \"With unveiled face,\" imply the image of \"beholding.\" They are, in fact, a description of \"the beatific vision.\" An additional reason for retaining the translation of our Authorized Version is that the verb is used in this sense by Philo ('Leg. Alleg.,' 3:33). The glory of the Lord. Namely, him who is \"the Effulgence of God's glory\" (Hebrews 1:2), the true Shechinah, \"the Image of the invisible God\" (Colossians 1:15). Are changed into the same image. The present tense implies a gradual transfiguration, a mystical and spiritual change which is produced in us while we contemplate Christ. From glory to glory. Our spiritual assimilation to Christ comes from his glory and issues in a glory like his (1 Corinthians 15:51; comp.\" from strength to strength,\" Psalm 84:7). (For the thought, comp. 1 John 3:2.) As by the Spirit of the Lord. This rendering (which is that of the Vulgate also) can hardly be correct. The natural meaning of the Greek is \"as by the [or, from] the Lord the Spirit.\" Our change into glory comes from the Lord, who, as St. Paul has already explained, is the Spirit of which he has been speaking. No such abstract theological thought is here in his mind as that of the \"hypostatic union,\" of the Son and the Holy Spirit. He is still referring to the contrast between the letter and the spirit, and his identification of this \"spirit\" in its highest sense with the quickening life which, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, we receive from Christ, and which is indeed identical with \"the Spirit of Christ.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Therefore. Because of the freedom and open vision of the gospel. As we have received mercy. Gratitude for a mercy so undeserved (1 Timothy 1:13) makes us fearless and vigorous in a ministry so glorious (Acts 20:23, 24). We faint not. The word implies the maintenance of a holy courage (1 Corinthians 16:13) and perseverance (2 Thessalonians 3:13). It occurs again in ver. 16, and in Luke 18:1; Galatians 6:9; Ephesians 3:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - But have renounced; rather, but we renounced. We renounced them once and forever at our baptism. The hidden things of dishonesty; literally, of shame; meaning, of course, of all that causes shame. Disgraceful as may be calunmies of my Jewish opponents, I have said farewell forever to everything for which a good man would blush. \"Honest\" was originally like the Greek word καλὸς, a general expression for moral excellence, as in Pope's line -NEWLINENEWLINE\"An honest man's the noblest work of God.\" Fletcher's -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Man is his own star, and the soul that canNEWLINEBe honest is the only perfect man.\" In craftiness. The word implies all subtle, cunning, underhand dealing (2 Corinthians 11:3), and it is clear from 2 Corinthians 12:16 that St. Paul had been charged with such conduct. The word is both used and illustrated in Luke 20:23. Handling the word of God deceitfully. He has already repudiated this charge by implication in 2 Corinthians 2:17, and he was always anxious to maintain an attitude of transparent sincerity (2 Corinthians 1:12) by uttering the truth and the whole truth (2 Corinthians 2:17; Acts 20:27), and not adulterating it. He had to meet such insinuations even in his first extant letter (1 Thessalonians 2:3). By manifestation of the truth. The constant recurrence to this thought shows the apostle's anxiety to remove the suspicion, created by the attacks of his opponents, that he had an esoteric teaching for some (2 Corinthians 1:13), kept some of his doctrines \"The truth\" cannot be preached by the aid of lies. The prominence of the word \"manifest\" in this Epistle is remarkable. St. Paul seems to be haunted by it (2 Corinthians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 3:3; 2 Corinthians 4:10; 2 Corinthians 5:10, 11; 2 Corinthians 7:12; 2 Corinthians 11:6). Commending ourselves. This is the only form of self-commendation or of \"commendatory letter\" for which I care. There is evidently a reference to the same verb used in 2 Corinthians 3:1. Before God (see 2 Corinthians 2:17; 2 Corinthians 7:12; Galatians 1:20). These solemn appeals are meant to show that it would be morally impossible for him to act as he was charged with acting. If he can assert his own integrity he will do so only as consciously in the presence of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But if our gospel be hid. This is added to avoid the semblance of a contradiction. He has spoken of \"manifestation of the truth,\" and yet has spoken of all Jews as unable to see it because they will not remove from their hearts the veil which hides it from them. How can \"a veiled gospel\" be a \"manifested truth\"? The answer is that the gospel is bright, but the eyes that should gaze on it are wilfully closed. Similarly in 2 Corinthians 2:16, he has compared the gospel to a fragrance of life, yet to the doomed captives - \"to the perishing\" - it comes \"like a waft from the charnel house.\" A better rendering would be, But even if our gospel (1 Corinthians 15:1; Romans 2:16) is a veiled one. it is veiled only among the perishing (comp. 1 Corinthians 1:18). Be hid; rather, has been veiled. To them that are lost; rather, to the perishing (see note on 2 Corinthians 2:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The god of this world; rather, the god of this age. It is, as Bengel says, \"a great and horrible description of the devil.\" He is not, however, here called a god of the kosmos, but only of the olam hazzeh, the present dispensation of things as it exists among those who refuse to enter that kingdom in which the power of Satan is brought to nought. The melancholy attempt to get rid of Manichean arguments by rendering the verse \"in whom God blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers of this world\" is set aside by the fact that the terrible description of Satan as \"another god\" (El acheer) was common among the rabbis. They knew that his power was indeed a derivative power, trot still that it was permitted to be great (Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 6:12). In John 12:31 (John 14:30) our Lord speaks of him as \"the ruler of the kosmos.\" Hath blinded; rather, blinded. The verb here has no other meaning than \"to blind,\" and is quite different from the verb \"to harden,\" rendered by \"to blind\" in 2 Corinthians 3:14 with the same substantive. They are blind from lack of faith, and so being \"unbelieving\" they are\" perishing\" (Ephesians 5:6), seeing that they \"walk in darkness\" (John 8:12) and are in Satan's power (Acts 26:18). Blindness of heart,\" says St. Augustine, \"is both a sin and a punishment of sin and a cause of sin.\" The light of the glorious gospel of Christ; rather, the illumination of the gospel of the glory of the Christ. The word photismos in later ecclesiastical Greek was used for \"baptism.\" Who is the image of God (2 Corinthians 3:18; Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:3). Should shine unto them; or, as in the Revised Version, should dawn upon them. The other rendering, \"that they should not see the illumination,\" gives to the verb augazo, a rarer sense, only found in poetry, and not known to the LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For we preach not ourselves. There is no glory or illumination on our faces, and we have no personal ends to gain, nor are we \"lords\" over your faith. This is, perhaps, meant as an answer to some charge of egotism. The Lord; rather, as Lord (Philippians 2:11; 1 Corinthians 12:3). Your servants; literally, your slaves (1 Corinthians 9:19). For Jesus' sake. So Christ had himself desired (Matthew 20:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Who commanded the light to shine out of darkness. The argument of the verse is that God, who created the material light (Genesis 1:3) and who is the Father of lights (James 1:1) and sent his Son to be the Light of the world (John 8:12), did not shine in our hearts for our sakes only, or that we might hide the light under a bushel for ourselves, but that we might transmit and reflect it. There is an implied comparison between the creation of light and the dawn of the gospel light, and each of these was meant for the good of all the world. The verse should be rendered, if we follow the best manuscripts, \"Because it is God, who said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God.\" In the face of Jesus Christ (see ch. 2:10; 3:7). Probably, however, there is a reference to the glory of God, not as reflected from the face of Christ, but as concentrated in and beaming from it (Hebrews 1:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-15. - Glory of the ministry in the midst of its weakness and suffering. Verse 7. - In earthen vessels. The glorious light which we have to show to the world is, like Gideon's torches, carried in earthen pitchers. The word skenos, vessel, is used in Mark 11:16, and \"vessels of earthenware\" in Revelation 2:27. St. Paul, in Acts 9:15, is called \"a vessel of election,\" whence Dante calls him lo vas d elezione. Man can never be more than an earthen vessel, being frail and humble, and the metaphor specially suits an apostle of Christ (see 1 Corinthians 2:3-5; 2 Timothy 2:20). But when he takes the Word of life from the earthen pitcher and waves it in the air, it illuminates all on whom the light shines. No commentator seems to have seen the probable allusion to Gideon's pitchers. It is the \"light,\" of which he has been speaking exclusively in the last verses, which constitutes the \"treasure.\" Those who suppose that the \"treasure\" is gold or silver or something else of value, refer to Jeremiah 32:14, and Herod., 3:103; Pers., 'Sat.,' 2:10. The excellency; literally, the excess or abundance. Of God, and not of us; rather, of God, and not from us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Troubled; afflicted, as in 2 Corinthians 1:4. On every side; in everything. Distressed; rather, driven to straits. Perplexed, but not in despair. In the original is a beautiful paronomasia, which might, perhaps, be represented in English by \"pressed, but not oppressed.\" Literally the words mean, being at a loss, but not utterly at a loss. In the special anguish of trial of which he spoke in 2 Corinthians 1:8 (comp. 2 Corinthians 7:5), he was indeed for a time \"utterly at a loss,\" reduced to utter despair; but in the normal conditions which he here describes he always, as it were, saw some outlet out of his worst perplexities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPersecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Not forsaken. St. Paul, like the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, knew by blessed experience the truth of the promise, \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee\" (Hebrews 13:5, 6). Cast down. Flung to the ground, as in some lost battle; yet not doomed, not \"perishing.\" \"Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand\" (Psalm 37:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlways bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The dying of the Lord Jesus; literally, the putting to death (Vulgate, mortificatio). This is even stronger than 2 Corinthians 1:5. It is not only \"the sufferings,\" but even \"the dying,\" of Christ of which his true followers partake (Romans 8:36, \"For thy sake are we killed all the day long\"). St. Paul, who was \"in deaths oft\" (2 Corinthians 11:23), was thus being made conformable unto Christ's death (Philippians 3:10). Philo, too, compares life to \"the daily carrying about of a corpse,\" and the Cure d'Ars used to speak of his body as \"ce cadavre.\" That the life also of Jesus, etc. The thought is exactly the same as in 2 Timothy 2:11, \"If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For Jesus' sake. St. Paul, as Bengel says, constantly thus repeats the name of Jesus, as one who felt its sweetness. The verse contains a reassertion and amplification of what he has just said. In our mortal flesh. This is added almost by way of climax. The life of Jesus is manifested, not only \"in our body,\" but even by way of triumph in its lowest and poorest element. God manifests life in our dying, and death in our living (Alford).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo then death worketh in us, but life in you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - So then. In accordance with what he has just said. Death worketh in us, but life in you. The life of us apostles is a constant death (Romans 8:36); but of this daily dying you reap the benefits; our dying is your living; our afflictions become to you a source of consolation and joy (2 Corinthians 1:6; Philippians 2:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - We; rather, But we. The same spirit of faith. The spirit manifested by the psalmist in the quotation which follows. It is from Psalm 116:10, a psalm which corresponded with St. Paul's mood because it was written in trouble sustained by faith. And this faith inspires him with the conviction that, after \"the body of this death,\" and after this death in life, there should begin for him also the life in death. St. Paul says nothing as to the authorship of the psalm, which probably belongs to a period far later than that of David. The words are from the LXX., and seem fairly to represent the disputed sense of the original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Which raised up the Lord Jesus (see 1 Corinthians 6:14). Shall raise up us also. The thought is again expressed in Romans 8:11. As he is here alluding mainly to the resurrection from the dead, it is clear that he contemplated the possibility of dying before Christ's second coming (comp. 1 Thessalonians 4:15). By Jesus. The reading supported by nearly all the best manuscripts is \"with Jesus\" (א, B, C, D, E, F, G), which perhaps appeared unsuitable to the copyists. But Christians are \"risen with Christ\" here (Colossians 2:12; Colossians 3:1); and in another sense also we rise with him, because the Church is \"the body of Christ\" (1 Corinthians 15:23). Shall present us with you. So St. Jude speaks of \"God our Saviour\" as able \"to present us\" before the presence of his glory (Jude 1:24, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - All things are for your sakes. St. Paul has already implied that his life is not his own (2 Corinthians 1:6; setup. 1 Corinthians 3:22, 23), and he recurs to the same thought in Colossians 1:24, and repeats once again towards the close of his life: \"I endure all things for the elect's sakes\" (2 Timothy 2:10). Might ... redound. The verb perisseuo may mean either \"I abound\" or \"I make to abound\" as in 2 Corinthians 9:8 and Ephesians 1:8. Here there is a similar thought to that expressed in 2 Corinthians 1:11, and the best rendering is, In order that the Divine favour, being multiplied through the greater number (of those who share in it), may make the thanksgiving (which it excites) abound to the honour of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-18. - The Christian minister is upheld by hope. Verse 16. - Therefore. Knowing that our daily death is the pathway to eternal life (ver. 14). We faint not (see ver. 1). Though; rather, even if. Our outward man. Our life in its human and corporeal conditions. The inward man. Namely, our moral and spiritual being, that \"new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him\" (Colossians 3:10). Is renewed; literally, is being renewed; i.e. by faith and hope. Day by day. The Greek phrase is not classical, but is a reminiscence of the Hebrew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For our light affliction, which is but for a moment; literally, for the immediate lightness of our affliction. Worketh for us. Is bringing about for us, with all the immeasurable force of a natural and progressive law. A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; literally, in excess unto excess. For the phrase, \"to excess - characteristic, like other emotional expressions, of this group of Epistles - see 2 Corinthians 1:8; Galatians 1:13. The word \"eternal\" is in antithesis to the \"for a moment.\" The \"weight\" is suggested by the \"lightness,\" and possibly also by the fact that in Hebrew the word for \"glory\" also means \"weight.\" The general contrast is found also in Matthew 5:12; 1 Peter 5:10; Hebrews 12:10; Romans 8:18. The frequent resemblances between this Epistle and that to the Romans are natural when we remember that they were written within a few months of each other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - While we look not at the things which are seen. The Greek suggests more of a reason, \"Since we are not gazing at things visible\" (see 2 Corinthians 5:7). Things which are not seen. The negative is the subjective negative. It expresses not only the fact that now these things are not seen, but that it is their nature to be unseen by the bodily eyes. Temporal. That is, temporary, transitory, phantasmal, a passing world; for which reason we do not fix our gaze or our aim upon it. But the things which are not seen are eternal The clause is important, as showing that eternity is not a mere extension of time, but a condition qualitatively different from time. The \"things eternal\" exist as much now as they will ever do. We are as much living in eternity now as we ever shall be. The only difference will be that we shall then see him who is now unseen, and realize the things which now are only visible to the eye of faith. This is one of the passages of St. Paul which finds a close parallel in Seneca ('Ep.,' 59). \"Invisibilia non decipiunt\" was, as Bishop Wordsworth tells us, the inscription put at the end of his garden arcade by Dr. Young, the poet.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - The hope of the future rife is the great support of our efforts. Verse 1. - For. A further explanation of the hope expressed in 2 Corinthians 4:17. We know. This accent of certainty is found only in the Christian writers. Our earthly house. Not the \"house of clay\" (Job 4:19), but the house which serves us as the home of our souls on earth; as in 1 Corinthians 15:40. Of this tabernacle; literally, the house of the tent; i.e. the tent of our mortality, the mortal body. In 2 Peter 1:13, 14 it is called skenoma, and the expression, \"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,\"is literally, \"he tabernacled among us\" - he wore \"a tent like ours and of the same material.\" The figure would be specially natural to one whose occupation was that of a tentmaker. Compare -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Here in the body pent,NEWLINEAfar from him I roam,NEWLINEBut nightly pitch my wandering tentNEWLINEA day's march nearer home.\" A very, similar expression occurs in Wisd. 9:15, \"The earthly tabernacle (γεῶδες σκῆνος) weigheth down the mind.\" Be dissolved; rather, be taken to pieces. A building. Something more substantial than that moving tenement. Of God; literally, from God; namely, not one of the \"many mansions\" spoken of in John 14:2, but the resurrection body furnished to us by him. We have this building from God, for it exists now, and shall be ours at the same time that our tent home is done away with. Not made with hands. Not like those tent dwellings at which St. Paul was daily toiling with the hands which ministered to his own necessities. In the heavens. To be joined with \"we have.\" Heaven is our general home and country (Hebrews 11:16), but the present allusion is to the glorified bodies in which our souls shall live in heaven (comp. 1 Corinthians 15:42-49).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - In this we groan. Since we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, who assures us of that future building from God, we, in this earthly tent, \"groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body\" (Romans 8:23). To be clothed upon; rather, to further clothe ourselves with. Here the metaphors of a tent and a garment - the \"wandering tent\" and the \"mortal vesture of decay\" - are interfused in a manner on which only the greatest writers can venture The corruptible yearns to clothe itself with the incorruptible, the mortal with immortality (1 Corinthians 15:53). The glorified body is compared to an over garment, House; rather, habitation (oiketerion).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If so be that. The verse may be rendered, \"If, that is, being clothed, we shall not be found naked.\" The word \"naked\" must then mean \"bodiless,\" and the reference will be to those whom, at his coming, Christ shall find clothed in these mortal bodies, and not separated from them, i.e. quick and not dead (1 Thessalonians 4:17; 1 Corinthians 15:51). This seems to be the simplest and most natural of the multitude of strange interpretations with which the pages of commentators are filled. It is true that the aorist endusamenoi, means literally, \"having clothed ourselves,\" and that, in taking this meaning, we should have expected the perfect participle endedumenoi, having been clothed. If this be thought an insuperable difficulty, we must suppose the verse to mean \"If, that is, in reality we shall be found [at Christ's coming] after having put on some intermediate body, and therefore not as mere disembodied spirits.\" But there is no allusion in Scripture to any intermediate body, nor is any gleam of light shed on the mode of life among the dead between death and resurrection, though the Church rejects the dream of Psychopannychia, or an interval of unconscious sleep. The uncertainty of the meaning is increased by two various readings, ei per instead of ei ge, which latter expresses greater doubt about the matter; and ekdusamenoi (D, F, G), which would mean \"if in reality, after unclothing ourselves [i.e. after 'shuffling off this mortal coil'], we shall not be found naked.\" This seems to be the conjecture of some puzzled copyists, who did not see that a contrast, and not a coincidence, between the two expressions is intended. If this reading were correct, it would mean, as Chrysostom says, \"Even if we would lay aside the body. we shall not there be presented without a body, but with the same body which has then become incorruptible.\" It is quite untenable to make \"clothed\" mean \"clothed with righteousness,\" as Olshausen does. In the Talmud, 'Shabbath' (f. 152, 2), the righteous are compared to men who keep from stain the robes given them by a king (i.e. their bodies), which robes the king deposits in his treasury and sends the wearers away (bodiless) in peace; but foolish servants stain these robes, and the king sends the robes to the wash, and the wearers in prison.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For we that are, etc.; literally, for indeed we who are in the tent; i.e. in the transitory mortal body. Do groan. \"Oh wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" (Romans 7:24). Being burdened. \"The corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things\" (Wisd. 9:15). Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon; more literally, since we do not wish to strip off (our bodily garment) but to put another garment over it. St. Paul here repudiates the Manichean notion that the body is a disgrace, or in itself the source of evil. He was not like Plotinus, who \"blushed that he had a body;\" or like St. Francis of Assist, who called his body \"my brother the ass;\" or like the Cure d'Ars, who (as we have said) spoke of his body as \"ce cadavre.\" He does not, therefore, desire to get rid of his body, but to \"clothe it over\" with the garment of immortality. Incidentally this implies the wish that he may be alive and not dead when the Lord returns (1 Corinthians 15:35-54). Mortality; rather, the mortal; that which is mortal. Might be swallowed up of life. As in the case of Enoch (Genesis 5:24) and Elijah (2 Kings 2:11), who entered into life otherwise than through \"the grave and gate of death.\" St. Paul wishes to enter the \"building from God\" without having been first buried in the collapse of the \"soul's dark cottage battered and decayed.\" He desires to put on the robe of immortality without stripping off the rent garb of the body.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He who hath wrought us for the selfsame thing. God prepared and perfected us for this very result, namely, to put on the robe of immortality. The earnest (see 2 Corinthians 1:22) The quickening life imparted by the Spirit of life is a pledge and part payment of the incorruptible eternal life. The Spirit is \"the Earnest of our inheritance\" (Ephesians 1:14; Ephesians 4:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Therefore we are always confident; literally, being of good courage. The sentence in the Greek is unfinished (an anacoluthon), but is resumed after the parenthesis by the repetition, \"we are of good courage.\" Always (2 Corinthians 4:8). We are at home in the body. The tent is pitched in the desert, and even the pillar of fire can only shine through its folds. Yet the tent may become brighter and brighter as life goes on.NEWLINENEWLINE\"To me the thought of death is terrible,NEWLINEHaving such hold on life.

Absent from the Lord (John 14:2, 3).

We do not yet see \"face to face\" (1 Corinthians 13:12), but are guided by things which \"eye hath not seen.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - To be absent, etc.; literally, to be away from the home of the body, but to be at home with the Lord. To be present with the Lord. The hope expressed is exactly the same as in Philippians 1:23, except that here (as in ver. 4) he expresses a desire not \"to depart,\" but to be quit of the body without the necessity for death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - We labour; literally, we are emulous. This, says Bengel, is \"the sole legitimate ambition.\" The same word occurs in Romans 15:20. Whether present or absent; literally, whether at home or away from home; i.e. whether with Christ or separated from him (as in ver. 8); or, \"whether in the body or out of the body\" (as in ver. 6). The latter would resemble 1 Thessalonians 5:10, \"That whether we wake or sleep we may live with him.\" We may be accepted of him; literally, to be well pleasing to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - We must all appear; rather, for it is necessary that we must all be made manifest; that we must be shown in our real nature and character. The verb is not the same as in Romans 14:10, which occurs in 2 Corinthians 4:14. Before the judgment seat of Christ. The special final judgment is represented as taking place before the bema of Christ, although in Romans 14:10 the best reading is \"of God\" (Matthew 25:31, 32). St. Paul might naturally use this Roman and Greek idea of the bema, being too familiar with it in his own experience (comp. Acts 12:21; Acts 18:12; Acts 25:6; Romans 14:10). The things done in the body; literally, the things (done) by the instrumentality of the body. Another reading (which only differs by a single letter from this) is, \"the proper things of the body\" (τὰ ἴδια τοῦ σώματος); i.e. the things which belong to it, which it has made its own. St. Paul, always intent on one subject at a time, does not stop to coordinate this law of natural retribution and inexorable Nemesis with that of the \"forgiveness of sins\" (1 Corinthians 5:11; Romans 3:25), or with the apparently universal hopes which he seems sometimes to express (Romans 5:17, 18; Romans 11:32). Omnia exeunt in mysterium. According to that he hath done; rather, with reference to the things he did. The aorist shows that all life will be as it were concentrated to one point. The Pelagians raised questions on this verse about the sinlessness of infants, etc., all of which may be left on one side, as probably nothing was more absolutely distant from the thoughts of St. Paul. Observe that each is to receive the natural issues of what he has done. There is to be an analogy between the sin and the retribution. The latter is but the ripe fruit of the former. We shall be punished by the action of natural laws, not of arbitrary inflictions. We shall reap what we have sown, not harvests of other grain (Romans 2:5-11; Revelation 22:12; Galatians 6:7). Whether it be good or bad. St. Paul, who always confines himself to one topic at a time, does not here enter on the question of the cutting off of the entailed curse by repentance and forgiveness. He leaves unsolved the antinomy between normal inevitable consequence and free remission.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-19. - Self-devotion of the ministry of reconciliation. Verse 11. - Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. Multitudes of texts have been torn from their context and grossly abused and misinterpreted, but few more so than this. It is the text usually chosen by those who wish to excuse a setting forth of God under the attributes of Moloch. With any such views it has not the remotest connection. It simply means, \"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men,\" either \"to keep in view the same fear of the Lord as ourselves,\" or (reverting to his last assertion of his own sincerity and integrity in ver. 9), \"that our sole ambition is to please God.\" The rendering, \"the terror of the Lord,\" for the every day expression, \"the fear of the Lord,\" was wantonly intruded into modern versions by Beza, and has not a single word to be said in its favour. The phrase means (as always) not the dread which God inspires, but the holy fear which mingles with our love of him. To teach men to regard God with terror is to undo the best teaching of all Scripture, which indeed has too often been the main end of human systems of theology. We persuade men. Not in a bad sense (Galatians 1:10). The attacks and calumnies of enemies make it necessary to vindicate our integrity is men; but we have no need to do so to God, because he already knows us (comp. \"persuading Blastus,\" Acts 12:20). We are made manifest unto God; rather, but to God we have been (and are) manifested. He needs no self defence from us. Are made manifest in your consciences; but I hope that I have been, and am now, made manifest in your consciences. In other words, I trust that this apology into which you have driven me has achieved its ends; and that, whatever may be your prejudices and innuendoes, before the bar of the individual conscience of each of you we now stand clear (comp. 2 Corinthians 4:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For we commend not ourselves again unto you. Still reverting to the charge that he was guilty of self praise, he says that his object is not this, for it was needless (2 Corinthians 3:2, 3). But give you occasion to glory on our behalf. But we speak as we have done to give you a starling-point for something to boast of on our behalf. He has already said (2 Corinthians 1:4) that the teachers and the taught in their mutual affection ought to have some ground for \"boasting\" (i.e. for speaking with some praise and exultation) of each other. The Corinthians were being robbed of this by the interested lies of St. Paul's opponents, who thought only about outward appearances. This is why no has set forth to them the aim and glory of his ministry. Nothing could be more gentle and forbearing than such a mode of stating his object. Yet for those who were sufficiently finely strung to understand it, there was an almost pathetic irony involved in it. Which glory in appearance, and not in heart; literally, in face. The grounds of their boasting, whatever they were, were superficial and external (2 Corinthians 10:7), not deep and sincere. But those who would judge of Paul aright must look into his very heart, and not on his face.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For whether we be beside ourselves; rather, for whether we were mad. Evidently some person or some faction had said of St. Paul, \"He is beside himself,\" just as Festus said afterwards, \"Paul, thou art mad,\" and as the Jews said of Paul's Lord and Master (John 10:20). The fervour of the apostle, his absorption in his work, his visions and ecstasies, his \"speaking with tongues more than they all,\" his indifference to externals, his bursts of emotion, might all have given colour to this charge, which he here ironically accepts. \"Mad or self controlled -all was for your sakes.\" It is to God; rather for God. My \"enthusiasm,\" \"exaltation,\" or, if you will, my \"madness,\" was but a phase of my work for him. We be sober. The word \"sober\" (sophron) is derived from two words which mean\" to save the mind.\" It indicates wise self control, such as was represented also by the many-sided Latin word frugi. It is the exact antithesis to madness (Acts 26:25). What you call my \"madness\" belongs to the relation between my own soul and God; my practical sense and tact are for you. For your sakes; literally, for you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The love of Christ. It matters little whether this be interpreted as a subjective genitive, \"Christ's love to man,\" or as an objective genitive, our love to Christ;\" for the two suppose and interfuse each other. St. Paul's usage, however, favours the former interpretation (2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 Corinthians 16:24). Constraineth. The word means that it compresses us, and therefore keeps us irresistibly to one object (Luke 12:50). That if one died for all, then were all dead. This is an unfortunate mistranslation and wrong reading for that one died for all, therefore all died. What compels Paul to sacrifice himself to the work of God for his converts is the conviction, which he formed once for all at his conversion, that One, even Christ, died on behalf of all men (Romans 5:15-19) a redeeming death (ver. 21); and that, consequently, in that death, all potentially died with him - died to their life of sin, and rose to the life of righteousness. The best comments on this bold and concentrated phrase are - \"I died to the Law that I might live to Christ;\" \"I have been crucified with Christ\" (Galatians 2:19, 20); and, \"Ye died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God\" (Colossians 3:3). When Christ died, all humanity, of which he was the federal Head, died potentially with him to sin and selfishness, as he further shows in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Unto themselves. That they should live no longer the psychic, i.e. the animal, selfish, egotistic life, but to their risen Saviour (Romans 14:7-9; 1 Corinthians 6:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Know no man after the flesh. It is a consequence of my death with Christ that I have done with carnal, superficial, earthly, external judgments according to the appearance, and not according to the heart. Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh. The word for \"know\" is different from the one just used (οῖδα, scio; ἔγνωκα, cognovi), and may be rendered, \"though we have taken note of.\" The whole phrase, which has been interpreted in multitudes of different ways, and has led to many different hypotheses, must be understood in accordance with the context. St. Paul is saying that he has now renounced all mere earthly and human judgments; and he here implies that the day has been (whether - which is a very unlikely view - before his conversion, when he looked on Christ as a \"deceiver,\" or just after his conversion, when possibly he may only have known him partially as the Jewish Messiah) when he knew Christ only in this fleshly way; but henceforth he will know him so no more. Probably this \"knowing Christ after the flesh\" is a rebuke to those members of the Christ party at Corinth who may have boasted that they were superior to all others because they had personally seen or known Christ - a spirit which Christ himself not only discouraged (John 16:7) but even rebuked (Matthew 12:50). To St. Paul Christ is now regarded as far above all local, national, personal, and Jewish limitations, and as the principle of spiritual life in the heart of every Christian. In the view which he took of his Lord St. Paul henceforth has banished all Jewish particularism for gospel catholicity. He regards Christ, not in the light of earthly relationships and conditions, but as the risen, glorified, eternal, universal Saviour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Therefore. If even a human, personal, external knowledge of Christ is henceforth of no significance, it follows that there must have been a total change in all relations towards him. The historic fact of such a changed relationship is indicated clearly in John 20:17. Mary Magdalene was there lovingly taught that a \"recognition of Christ after the flesh,\" i.e. as merely a human friend, was to be a thing of the past. In Christ; i.e. a Christian. For perfect faith attains to mystic union with Christ. A new creature; rather, a new creation (Galatians 6:15). The phrase is borrowed from the rabbis who used it to express the condition of a proselyte. But the meaning is not mere Jewish arrogance and exclusiveness, but the deep truth of spiritual regeneration and the new birth (John 3:3; Ephesians 2:10; Ephesians 4:23, 24; Colossians 3:3, etc.). Old things; literally, the ancient things, all that belongs to the old Adam. Behold. The word expresses the writer's vivid realization of the truth he is uttering. All things. The whole sphere of being, and therewith the whole aim and character of life. The clause illustrates the \"new creation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And all things are of God; literally, but all things (in this \"new creation\") are from God. Who hath reconciled us; rather, who (by Christ's one offering of himself) reconciled us to himself. We were his enemies (Romans 5:10; Romans 11:28), but, because he was still our Friend and Father, he brought us back to himself by Christ. The ministry of reconciliation. The ministry which teaches the reconciliation which he has effected for us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. This and the many other passages of Scripture which always represent the atonement as the work of the blessed Trinity, and as being the result of the love, not of the wrath, of God, ought to have been a sufficient warning against the hideous extravagance of those forensic statements of the atonement which have disgraced almost a thousand years of theology (Romans 5:10; 1 John 4:10). That God's purpose of mercy embraced all mankind, and not an elect few, is again and again stated in Scripture (see Colossians 1:20). Not imputing their trespasses unto them. See this developed in Romans 15:5-8. Hath entrusted unto us; literally, who also deposited in us, as though it were some sacred treasure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Now then. It is, then, on Christ's behalf that we are ambassadors. This excludes all secondary aims. St. Paul uses the same expression in Ephesians 6:20, adding with fine contrast that he is \"an ambassador in fetters.\" As though God did beseech you by us; rather, as if God were exhorting you by our means. In Christ's stead; rather, we, on Christ's behalf, beseech you. Be ye reconciled to God. This is the sense of the embassy. The aorist implies an immediate acceptance of the offer of reconciliation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He hath made him to be sin for us; rather, he made; he speaks with definite reference to the cross. The expression is closely analogous to that in Galatians 3:13, where it is said that Christ has been \"made a curse for us.\" He was, as St. Augustine says, \"delictorum susceptor, non commissor.\" He knew no sin; nay, he was the very righteousness, holiness itself (Jeremiah 23:6), and yet, for our benefit, God made him to be \"sin\" for us, in that he \"sent him in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin\" (Romans 8:3). Many have understood the word \"sin\" in the sense of sin offering (Leviticus 5:9, LXX.); but that is a precarious application of the word, which is not justified by any other passage in the New Testament. We cannot, as Dean Plumptre says, get beyond the simple statement, which St. Paul is content to leave in its unexplicable mystery, \"Christ identified with man's sin; man identified with Christ's righteousness.\" And thus, in Christ, God becomes Jehovah-Tsidkenu, \"the Lord our Righteousness\" (Jeremiah 23:6). That we might be made the righteousness of God in him; rather, that we might become. The best comment on the pregnant significance of this verse is Romans 1:16, 17, which is developed and explained in so large a section of that great Epistle (see 3:22-25; 4:5-8; 5:19, etc.). In him In his blood is a means of propitiation by which the righteousness of God becomes the righteousness of man (1 Corinthians 1:30), so that man is justified. The truth which St. Paul thus develops and expresses is stated by St. Peter and St. John in a simpler and less theological form (1 Peter 2:22-24; 1 John 3:5).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - We then, as fellow workers. Continuing the entreaty of 2 Corinthians 5:20, he adds, \"But as [his] fellow workers we also exhort you.\" The \"also\" shows that he does not rest content with merely entreating them (δεόμεθα), but adds to the entreaty an exhortation emphasized by a self-sacrificing ministry. \"Fellow workers with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Beseech. The word is the same as that rendered \"beseech\" by the Authorized Version in 2 Corinthians 5:20, and it should be rendered \"exhort:\" \"God exhorts you by our means; we therefore entreat you to be reconciled to God; yes, and as Christ's fellow workers we exhort you.\" That ye receive not. The word means both passively to receive and actively to accept as a personal boon. The grace of God. To announce this is the chief aim of the gospel (Acts 13:43; Acts 20:24). In vain; that is, \"without effect.\" You must not only accept the teaching of God's Word, but must see that it produces adequate moral results. It must not, so to speak, fall \"into a vacuum (εἰς κενόν).\" \"He,\" says Pelagius, \"receives the grace of God in vain who, in the new covenant, is not himself new.\" If you really are in Christ you must show that you have thereby become \"a new creation\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). The branches of the true Vine must bear fruit. (For the phrase, \"in vain,\" see Galatians 2:2; Philippians 2:16.) What the grace of God is meant to effect is sketched in Titus 2:11, 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For he saith; that is, \"God saith.\" The nominative is involved in the \"fellow workers,\"so that this is hardly to be classed with those rabbinic methods of citation found also in Philo, which deliberately omit the word \"God\" as the speaker, and use \"He\" by preference. I have heard thee, etc. The quotation is from the LXX. of Isaiah 49:8, and is meant to express the necessity for receiving the grace of God, not only efficaciously, but at once. The \"thee\" in Isaiah is the Servant of Jehovah, the type primarily of Christ, and then of all who are \"in Christ.\" In a time accepted; literally, in the Hebrew, in a time of favour. It is the season of grace, before grace has been wilfully rejected, and the time for judgment begins (Proverbs 1:24-28). The accepted time; literally, the well-accepted opportunity. St. Paul in his earnestness strengthens the force of the adjective. The same word occurs in 2 Corinthians 8:12; Romans 15:16, 31.NEWLINENEWLINE\"There is a deep nick in Time's restless wheelNEWLINEFor each man's good.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Chapman.) Now. No doubt St. Paul meant that, as long as life lasts, the door of repentance is never absolutely closed; but it is probable that he had specially in view the nearness of the advent of Christ. Compare the stress laid upon the word \"today\" in Hebrews 3:7, 8, and \"at least in this thy day\" (Luke 19:42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGiving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Giving no offence in anything. An undercurrent of necessary self defence runs through St. Paul's exhortation. The participle is, like \"fellow workers,\" a nominative to \"we exhort you\" in ver. 1. Offence. The word here is not skandalon, which is so often rendered \"offence,\" but proskope, which occurs here alone in the New Testament, and is not found in the LXX. It means \"a cause of stumbling.\" Proskomma, a stumbling block, is used in 1 Corinthians 8:9. Be not blamed. When any just blame can be attached to the minister, the force of the ministry of reconciliation is fatally weakened. (For the word, see 2 Corinthians 8:20.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Approving ourselves; rather, commending ourselves, He is again referring to the insinuation, which had evidently caused him deep pain, that he was not authorized to preach, as his Judaic opponents were, by \"letters of commendation\" (2 Corinthians 3:1-3) from James or from the ciders at Jerusalem. His credentials came from God, who had enabled him to be so faithful. As the ministers of God (1 Corinthians 4:1). The article should be omitted. In much patience. Christ had forewarned his apostles that they would have much to endure, and had strengthened them by the promise that \"he that endureth to the end shall be saved\" (Matthew 10:22). In afflictions. This word, as we have seen, is one of the haunting words in 2 Corinthians 1:4-11. In necessities. St, Paul was poor, and was often in want (Acts 20:34). In distresses. The same word which occurs in 2 Corinthians 4:8. It means \"extreme pressure\" (literally, narrowness of space), and is a climax of the other words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In stripes (comp. 2 Corinthians 11:23-28). The stripes were of two kinds - from Jewish whips and Roman rods. But of the five scourgings with Jewish whips not one is mentioned in the Acts, and only one of the three scourgings with Roman rods (Acts 16:23). Nothing, therefore, is more clear than that the Acts only furnishes us with a fragmentary and incomplete record, in which, as we gather from the Epistles, either the agonies of St. Paul's lifelong martyrdom are for some reason intentionally minimized, or else (which is, perhaps, mere probable) St. Paul was, as his rule and habit, so reticent about his own sufferings in the cause of Christ that St. Luke was only vaguely, if at all, aware of many scenes of trial through which he had passed. In imprisonments. St. Paul was frequently in prison, but St. Luke only tells us of one of these occasions (Acts 16:24) - at Philippi; the Roman imprisonment and that at Caesarea were subsequent to this Epistle. In tumults. These were a normal incident of St. Paul's life, both up to this time and for years afterwards (Acts 13:50; Acts 14:19; Acts 16:22; Acts 17:4, 5; Acts 18:12; Acts 19:28, 29; Acts 21:27-39; Acts 22:22, 23; Acts 23:9, 10; Acts 27:42, etc.) The word akatastasiai might also mean \"insecurities,\" i.e. homelessness, wanderings, uncertainties (comp. 1 Corinthians 4:11); but New Testament usage seems decisive in favour of the frowner meaning (2 Corinthians 12:20; 1 Corinthians 14:33; James 3:15). In labours (2 Corinthians 11:28; 1 Corinthians 4:12; 1 Corinthians 15:10; Acts 20:34; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8). In watchings. \"Spells of sleeplessness\" were a necessary incident of such a life; and an eminently nervous nature like that of St. Paul is rarely capable of the habitual relief of sound steep. Hence he again refers to this in 2 Corinthians 11:27. His \"sleeplessness\" was sometimes the necessary result of labours \"night and day\" (Acts 20:31; 1 Thessalonians 2:9, etc.). In fastings. St. Paul never inculcates the practice of voluntary fasting as a duty (for the reading in 1 Corinthians 7:5 is more than dubious); but it is probable that he found it personally useful at times (Acts 13:2, 3; Acts 14:23; Acts 9:9). The nine forms of suffering hitherto mentioned - three general, three specific, and three voluntary - are all physical sufferings borne with \"much endurance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - By pureness; rather, in pureness, as the preposition is the same. He now gives six instances of special gifts and virtues. The \"pureness\" is not only \"chastity,\" but absolute sincerity (1 John 3:3; 2 Corinthians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 2:10). By knowledge. The knowledge is the true knowledge of the gospel in its fulness (Ephesians 3:4). In his depth of insight into the truth St. Paul was specially gifted. The word gnosis had not yet acquired the fatal connotations which afterwards discredited it. By long suffering (2 Timothy 3:10; 2 Timothy 4:2). The patient endurance of insults, of which St. Paul shows a practical specimen in this Epistle, and still more in Philippians 1:15-18. By kindness. \"Love suffereth long, and is kind\" (1 Corinthians 13:4); \"Long suffering, kindness\" (Galatians 5:22). By the Holy Ghost. To the special gift of the Spirit St. Paul attributed all his success (1 Thessalonians 1:5; Romans 15:18, 19). By love unfeigned; which is the surest fruit of the Spirit, and the best of all spiritual gifts (2 Corinthians 12:15; 1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 13; Romans 12:9, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - By the word of truth. St. Paul now passes to the more specific endowments of the true teacher (comp. 2 Corinthians 2:17; 2 Corinthians 4:2; 1 Corinthians 2:4; Galatians 2:5). By the power of God; literally, in power of God (2 Corinthians 4:7; 1 Corinthians 2:4; 1 Corinthians 4:20). \"For the kingdom of God is not [only] in word, but in power.\" By the armour of righteousness. Here first the preposition \"in\" (ἐν) is changed for \"through,\" \"by means of\" (διὰ). Armour; rather, arms. On the right hand and on the left. That is, both by offensive weapons and a defensive panoply (2 Corinthians 10:4; Ephesians 6:11-17; 1 Thessalonians 5:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - By honour and dishonour; rather, by glory and dishonour. There is no need to change here the meaning of διὰ, \"by means of,\" to \"through,\" i.e. \"amid.\" The honour and dishonor are alike means which contribute to the commendation of the ministry. Of our Lord some said, \"He is a deceiver,\" while others said, \"He is a good man\" (John 7:12); and the dispraise of some is the highest praise (Matthew 5:11). Compare with the whole passage 1 Corinthians 4:9-13, where we see that \"abuse,\" \"insult,\" and \"slander,\" constituted no small part of the apostle's daily trial. By evil report and good report. The beatitude of malediction (Luke 6:22; 1 Peter 4:14). St. Paul had deliberately abandoned the desire to win the suffrages of men at the cost of undesirable concessions (Galatians 1:10). As deceivers. The Jews called Christ \"a deceiver\" (mesith, i.e. a deliberate and misleading impostor), Matthew 27:63; John 7:12. This is an illustration of the \"evil report,\" and in the Clementine homilies, a century later, St. Paul, under the disgraceful pseudonym of \"Simon Magus,\" is still defamed as a deceiver. And yet true. There is no \"yet\" in the original, and its omission gives more force to these eloquent and impassioned contrasts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As unknown; literally, as being ignored; as those whom no one cares to recognize. And yet well known. \"And becoming fully recognized.\" \"Recognized\" by God (1 Corinthians 13:12), and ultimately by all good men (2 Corinthians 11:6), though they might be contemptuously ignored by men. As dying (2 Corinthians 1:9; 2 Corinthians 4:10, 11). Behold. The word calls attention to what seemed like a daily miracle. The paradox of the Greek tragedian -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Who knows if life be death, and death be life?\" which seemed so supremely amusing to Aristophanes and the wits of Athens, became a familiar fact to the early Christians (Romans 8:36; 1 Corinthians 15:31; Ephesians 2:5, 6; Colossians 2:13, etc.). As chastened. The daily Divine education of suffering (Psalm 118:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing. The early Christians always insist on \"joy\" as one of the fruits of the Spirit (comp. Matthew 5:10-12), and especially joy in the midst of grief and anguish (Romans 5:3; Romans 14:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:16, \"Rejoice always\"). The best proof that this was no mere phraseology, but an amazing and new charism granted to the world, may be seen in the Epistle to the Philippians. It was written when St. Paul was old, poor, deserted, imprisoned, in danger of immediate death. and apparently in the lowest deeps of forsakes sorrow; vet the spontaneous keynote of the whole Epistle is, \"I rejoice; rejoice ye\" (Philippians 4:6, 12). As poor. The word means even \"paupers,\" and describes a very literal fact. St. Paul, for Christ's sake, had suffered \"the loss of all things\" (Philippians 3:8). Yet making many rich. Not by getting collections for them (which would be a most unworthy antithesis, though it is strangely accepted by Chrysostom and others); but \"by imparting to them the true riches, in the form of spiritual gifts, and the teaching of the gospel\" (comp. James 2:5). Possessing all things; rather, as having nothing, and fully having all things. The verb means \"possessing all things to the full.\" For \"all things are ours\" (1 Corinthians 3:21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-18. - An appeal to the Corinthians to reciprocate his love for them, and separate themselves from evil. Verse 11. - Corinthians! A rare and very personal form of loving appeal, which occurs nowhere else in these Epistles (comp. Philippians 4:15). Our mouth is open to you. St. Paul has evidently been writing in a mood of inspired eloquence. The fervour of his feelings has found vent in an unusual flow of beautiful and forcible language. He appeals to the unreserved freedom with which he has written as a reason why they should treat him with the same frank love. Our heart is enlarged. After writing the foregoing majestic appeal, he felt that he had disburdened his heart, and as it were made room in it to receive the Corinthians unreservedly, in spite of all the wrongs which some of them had done him (comp. 2 Corinthians 7:3, 27). On the antithesis of the mouth and the heart, see Matthew 12:34; Romans 10:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Ye are not straitened in us. Any narrowing of the sympathy or straining of the relations between us does not rise in any way from me. (For the verb, see 2 Corinthians 4:8.) Ye are straitened in your own bowels; rather, in your own hearts. Any tightening or pressure of the feelings which should exist between us rises solely from your own hearts. Enlarge and open them, as I have done, and we shall once more love each other aright. The verb has already occurred in 2 Corinthians 4:8 (\"distressed\"). Your own bowels. It is to be regretted that the Authorized Version adopted the meaningless and often rather incongruous word \"bowels\" for the Greek word σπλάγχνα used in its Hebraic sense of \"feelings,\" \"affections\" (Song of Solomon 5:4; Isaiah 16:11). This literalism is always out of place, and especially in Philemon 1:7, 12, 20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Now, for a recompense in the same. He begs them to give him \"a reward in kind;\" in other words, he wishes them to be as frank with him as he has been to them. As unto my children. And therefore, as a spiritual father, I may surely ask for sympathy. St. Paul uses the same metaphor in 1 Corinthians 4:14; 1 Thessalonians 2:11. Be ye also enlarged.

Ewald, followed by Dean Stanley, Holsten, and others, thinks that here there is a sudden dislocation of the argument, and some have even supposed that the section, 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1, is either an after thought written by the apostle on the margin of the Epistle after it was finished; or even an interpolation. The latter view has arisen from the unusual expressions of the section, and the use of the word \"Belial,\" and the command of Greek shown by the varied expressions. There is no adequate ground for these conjectures. Every writer is conscious of moods in which words come to him more fluently than at other times, and all writers of deep feeling, like St. Paul, abound in sudden transitions which correspond to the lightning-like rapidity of their thoughts. It is doubtful whether the readers would not have seen at once the sequence of thought, which depends on circumstances which we can only conjecture. Probably the alienation from St. Paul had its root in some tampering with unbelievers. Such might at any rate have been the case among the Gentile members of the Church, some of whom were even willing to go to sacrificial feasts in heathen temples (1 Corinthians 8-10.). \"Unequally yoked\" is a metaphor derived from Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:10, and is the opposite of \"true yoke fellow\" (Philippians 4:3). What fellowship; literally, participation (Ephesians 5:6-11). Unrighteousness; literally, lawlessness (1 John 3:4). It was a special mark of heathen life (Romans 7:19). Light with darkness. This antithesis is specially prominent in Ephesians 5:9-11 and Colossians 1:12, 13, and in the writings of St. John (John 1:5; John 3:19; 1 John, passim).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Concord; literally, harmony or accord. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. The adjective sumphonos occurs in 1 Corinthians 7:5. Christ with Belial (see 1 Corinthians 10:21), Belial. Here used in the form Beliar, as a proper name, because no Greek word ends in the letter τ. In the Old Testament it does not stand for a person, but means \"wickedness\" or \"worthlessness.\" Thus in Proverbs 6:12 \"a naughty person\" is adam belial. \"A son of Belial\" means \"a child of wickedness\" by a common Hebraism (Deuteronomy 13:13; Judges 19:22). And hence, since Belial only became a proper name in later days -NEWLINENEWLINE\"To him no temples rose,NEWLINENo altars smoked.\" Perhaps, as has been conjectured, this clause, which contains two such unusual words, may be a quotation. It is, however, no ground of objection that Belial does not occur elsewhere in St. Paul, for until the pastoral Epistles he only uses diabolos twice (Ephesians 4:27; Ephesians 6:11). What part, etc.? This is not, like the other clauses, an illustration, but the statement of the fact itself which \"has come in amidst the lively, sweeping flow of the discourse.\" With an infidel; i.e. with an unconverted Gentile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - What agreement. The word means \"unity of composition.\" This is the fifth synonym which St. Paul has used in this clause - μετοχὴ κοινωνία συμφώνησις, μερὶς συγκατάθεσις. The verb συγκατάθημι occurs in Luke 23:51. St. Paul in this chapter shows an almost unwonted command over the Greek language. With idols (Matthew 6:24; 1 John 5:21). Ye. \"We\" is the reading of א, B, D, L. Ewald, without sufficient ground, makes it one of his arguments for regarding this section as interpolated (comp. 2 Corinthians 5:21). Are the temple of the living God. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in every Christian heart, which is the distinguishing result of the new covenant, was very prominent in the thoughts of St. Paul (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19; Ephesians 2:21, 22; 1 Timothy 3:15; comp. 1 Peter 2:5; Hebrews 3:6). As God hath said. The quotation is altered slightly from the LXX. of Leviticus 26:12. But in this and the next verses we have \"a mosaic of citations\" from this passage and Exodus 29:45; Isaiah 53:11; Ezekiel 20:34; 2 Samuel 7:14; comp. Jeremiah 31:9; Isaiah 43:6. This mode of compressing the essence of various quotations into one passage was common among the rabbis. In them. In the original Hebrew this means \"among them\" (Exodus 29:45; Leviticus 26:12). since the indwelling of God by his Holy Spirit belongs only to the new covenant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - From among them; i.e. from among the unbelievers. Touch not the unclean thing (Leviticus 11:8, etc.; Isaiah 52:11). I will receive you (comp. Ezekiel 20:34). These promises to Israel are naturally transferred to the ideal Israel, the Christian Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And will be a Father unto you. These reminiscences are sufficiently near to 2 Samuel 7:8-14; Isaiah 43:6; Jeremiah 31:9, to render needless the supposition that they come from any apocryphal book (Ewald) or Jewish hymn (Grotius). Saith the Lord Almighty. The phrase, not elsewhere used by St. Paul, is taken from 2 Samuel 7:8 (LXX.). The epithet indicates the certain fulfilment of the promises. Pantokrator, for \"Almighty,\" is used in the LXX. for \"Lord of sabaoth,\" and in the New Testament only occurs elsewhere in the Apocalypse.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Having then these promises. The promises of God's indwelling and fatherly love (2 Corinthians 6:16-18). Dearly beloved. Perhaps the word is added to soften the sternness of the preceding admonition. Let us cleanse ourselves. Every Christian, even the best, has need of daily cleansing from his daily assoilment (John 13:10), and this cleansing depends on the purifying activity of moral effort maintained by the help of God's grace. Similarly St. John (1 John 3:1-3), after speaking of God's fatherhood and the hopes which it inspires, adds, \"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure\" (comp. James 4:8). From all filthiness; rather, from all defilement. Sin leaves on the soul the moral stain of guilt, which was typified by the ceremonial defilements of the Levitical Law (comp. Ezekiel 36:25, 26). The word used for \"filth\" in 1 Peter 3:21 is different. Of the flesh and spirit. From everything which outwardly pollutes the body and inwardly the soul; the two being closely connected together, so that what defiles the flesh inevitably also defiles the soul, and what defiles the spirit degrades also the body. Uncleanness, for instance, a sin of the flesh, is almost invariably connected with pride and hate and cruelty, which degrade the soul. Perfecting holiness. This is the goal and aim of the Christian, though in this life it cannot be finally attained (Philippians 3:12). In the fear of God. There is, indeed, one kind of fear, a base and servile fear, which is cast out by perfect love; but the fear of reverential awe always remains in the true and wisely instructed Christian, who will never be guilty of the profane familiarity adopted by some ignorant sectarians, or speak of God \"as though he were some one in the next street\" (Hebrews 12:28; 1 Peter 3:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReceive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Receive us; rather, open your hearts to us; make room for us (comp. Mark 2:2; John 2:6). It is an appeal to them to get rid of the narrowness of heart, the constricted affections, of which he has complained in 2 Corinthians 6:12. We have wronged... corrupted... defrauded no man. The \"no man\" in the original is placed first, and this emphatic position, together with its triple repetition, marks St. Paul's insistence on the fact that, whatever his enemies might insinuate, there was no single member of their Church who could complain of injury, moral harm, or unfair treatment from him. Clearly he is again thinking of definite slanders against himself. His sternness to the offender may have been denounced as a wrong; his generous sanction of broad views about clean and unclean meats, idol-offerings, etc., may have been represented as corrupting others by false teaching (2 Corinthians 2:17) or bad example (2 Corinthians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 4:6); his urgency about the collection for the saints (2 Corinthians 12:16; Acts 20:33), or his assertion of legitimate authority, may have been specified as greed for power. The verb pleonektein is often used in connection with other verbs, implying sensuality. It is difficult for us even to imagine that St. Paul had ever been charged with gross immorality; but it may have been so, for in a corrupt atmosphere everything is corrupt. Men like Nero and Heliogabalus, being themselves the vilest of men, openly declared their belief that no man was pure, and many in the heathen world may have been inclined to similar suspicions. Of Whitefield, the poet says -NEWLINENEWLINE\"His sins were such as Sodom never knew,NEWLINEAnd calumny stood up to swear all true.\" We know too that the Christians were universally charged with Thyestean banquets and promiscuous licentiousness. It is, however, more natural to take pleonektein in its general sense, in which it means \"to overreach,\" \"to claim or seize more than one's just rights\" (see 2 Corinthians 2:11) In 1 Corinthians 9:1-6 he is defending himself against similar charges, as also in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 5:12; 6:3; 10:7-11; 11; 12., passim). For similar strains of defence, see those of Moses and of Samuel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I speak not this to condemn you. \"Not by way of condemnation am I speaking.\" My object is to maintain the old love between us; what I say, therefore, is merely to defend myself, not to complain of you (comp. 1 Corinthians 4:14). I have said before. He has not said it in so many words, but has implied it in 2 Corinthians 3:2, 3; 2 Corinthians 6:11-14. Ye are in our hearts. So he says to his beloved Philippians, \"I have you in my heart\" (Philippians 1:7). To die and live with you. Similarly he tells the Thessalonians that he was ready to give them even his own life (1 Thessalonians 2:8). This is no mere conventional expression of deep affection, like Horace's, \"Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;\" nor is it the description of some compact for life and death like that of the Theban Band. It has the deeper meaning which was involved by the words \"life\" and \"death\" on the lips of a Christian (2 Corinthians 4:11; 2 Corinthians 6:9). And one whose life was, for Christ's sake, a daily death, naturally mentions death first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreat is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Boldness of speech. St. Paul feels that he may address them with perfect frankness and openness (2 Corinthians 3:12). My glorying of you. \"My boasting on your account\" (2 Corinthians 1:14; 2 Corinthians 5:12; 2 Corinthians 8:14; comp. 1 Corinthians 1:4-7). I am filled with comfort. \"I have been filled with the consolation.\" \"Consolation\" is the word which occurs so frequently in 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4. I am exceeding joyful. \"I superabound in my joy\" (2 Corinthians 2:2-14). In all our tribulation. The clause belongs to both the preceding clauses. Joy in the very midst of affliction was an essentially Christian blessing (Philippians 2:17).NEWLINENEWLINE\"Thou shalt have joy in sadness soon;NEWLINEThe pure calm hope be thineNEWLINEWhich brightens the Eastern moon,NEWLINEWhen day's wild lights decline.\" (See 2 Corinthians 6:10; Galatians 5:22; Romans 14:17; John 15:11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For, when we were come into Macedonia. \"For even when we came.\" The word \"affliction\" reminds St. Paul to resume the thread of the narrative which makes this letter almost like an itinerary. He has spoken of his trials in Ephesus (2 Corinthians 1:8) and in the Troad (2 Corinthians 2:12, 13), and now he tells them that even in Macedonia he was no less troubled and agitated. Our flesh had no rest. External troubles assailed him as well as inward anxiety. \"Had\" seems here to be the best reading (B, F, G, K); not \"has had,\" which may be borrowed from 2 Corinthians 2:13. Rest; rather, remission, respite. But we were troubled on every side; literally, but in everything being afflicted. The style, in its picturesque irregularity, almost seems as though it were broken by sobs. Without were fightings, within were fears. \"From without battles, from within fears.\" No light is thrown on these \"battles.\" The Acts of the Apostles has no details to give us of this brief stay in Macedonia. The \"fears\" were doubtless still connected with anxiety as to the reception of Titus, and of his First Epistle (1 Corinthians 12:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Who comforteth those that are cast down. \"The Comforter of the humble comforted us, even God.\" The word \"humble\" has in classical Greek the sense of \"mean,\" \"abject.\" Pride, not humility, was the virtue even of Stoic morality. Christ was the first to reveal the beatitude of lowliness (Matthew 11:29; Luke 1:52). Doubtless the word still retained some of its old associations, and had been used of St. Paul in a disparaging sense (2 Corinthians 10:1). But he whom his opponents accused of so much egotism, ambition, and arrogance, meekly accepts the term and applies it to himself. God (2 Corinthians 1:4). \"The God... of consolation\" (Romans 15:5). By the coming of Titus. This was the cause of that outburst of joy in 2 Corinthians 2:13, 14, which passage here finds its explanation. The absence of Titus from the Acts is another proof of the fragmentariness of that book. It is evident that he was an ardent, able, active fellow worker, and most beloved friend of the apostle (Galatians 2:1, 3; 2 Timothy 4:10; Titus 1:4; Titus 3:12). We learn most about him from this Epistle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And not by his coming only. The mere fact of Titus's arrival cheered St. Paul, because Titus seems to have been of a strong and cheery temperament. St. Paul, partly because of his infirmities, was peculiarly dependent on the support of human sympathy (1 Thessalonians 3:1-8; Philippians 2:20; 2 Timothy 4:4; Acts 17:15; Acts 28:15). It was not, however, the mere arrival of Titus which cheered him, but still more the good news which he brought, and which partially lightened his anxieties. In all probability this letter was written almost immediately after the arrival of Titus, and while the joy caused by his presence was still glowing in the apostle's heart. It is characteristic of the seclusion of an austere life that St. Jerome supposes the cause of the apostle's distress to have been that Titus was his interpreter, and that in his absence he could not preach! Your earnest desire. Your yearning to see me once more. Mourning; rather, lamentation (see 2 Corinthians 2:12). They were aroused to lament their past \"inflation\" (1 Corinthians 5:2) and remissness. Your fervent mind toward me. This rendering well expresses the kindling affection implied by the word zelos. So that I rejoiced the more. More than he had even anticipated could be possible; or, as the next verse may imply, all the more because of his past anguish (2 Corinthians 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - With a letter; rather, with my Epistle. Probably the First Epistle, though some suppose that the allusion is to a lost intermediate letter. I do not repent, though I did repent; better, I do not regret it. Every one has experienced the anxiety which has followed the despatch of some painful letter. If it does good, well; but perhaps it may do harm. The severity was called for; it seemed a duty to write severely. But how will the rebuke be received? Might we not have done better if we had used language less uncompromisingly stern? As St. Paul thought with intense anxiety that perhaps in his zeal for truth he may have irrevocably alienated the feelings of the Corinthians, whom, with all their grave faults, he loved, a moment came when he actually regretted what he had written. He himself assures us that he had this feeling. Those who try all kinds of fantastic hypotheses and tortuous exegesis to explain away this phrase as though it were inconsistent with St. Paul's inspiration, go to Scripture to find there their own a priori dogmas, not to seek what Scripture really says. The doctrine of inspiration is not the fetish into which it has been degraded by formal systems of scholastic theology. Inspiration was not a mechanical dictation of words, but the influence of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men who retained all their own natural emotions. For I perceive, etc. There are various ways of taking this clause. Nothing, however, is simpler than to regard it as a parenthetic remark (for I see that that Epistle, though it were but for a time, saddened you). Though it were but for a season. (For the phrase, see Philemon 1:15; Galatians 2:5.) He means to say that their grief will at any rate cease when they receive this letter, and he can bear the thought of having pained them when he remembers the brevity of their grief and the good effects which resulted from it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Not that ye were made sorry. They might have drawn this mistaken conclusion from his remark that he \"rejoiced\" when he heard of their \"lamentation\" (ver. 7). After a godly sort; literally, according to God; i.e. in a way which he would approve (Romans 8:27). In nothing. Not even when we rebuked you, and caused you pain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For godly sorrow, etc. \"For the sorrow Which is according to God worketh out a repentance unto salvation which bringeth no regret.\" Sin causes regret, remorse, that sort of repentance (metomeleia) which is merely an unavailing rebellion against the inevitable consequences of misdoing; but the sorrow of self-reproach which follows true repentance (metanoia, change of mind) is never followed by regret. Some take \"not to be regretted\" with \"salvation,\" but it is a very unsuitable adjective to that substantive. The sorrow of the world. Here sorrow for the loss, or disappointment, or shame, or ruin, or sickness caused by sin; such as the false repentance of Cain, Saul, Ahithophel, Judas, etc. Death. Moral and spiritual death always, and sometimes physical death, and always - unless it is followed by true repentance - eternal death, which is the opposite of salvation (Romans 5:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For behold, etc. The effects produced by their repentance showed that it was \"according to God;\" for it brought forth in them \"the fruits of good living to the honour and glory of God.\" Carefulness; rather, earnestness, active endeavour. Yea what. There is an untranslatable energy about the original Greek. The same use of ἀλλὰ (Latin, immo vero) in a climax is found in 1 Corinthians 6:11. Clearing of yourselves; literally, apology, self-defence, addressed to me through Titus. Indignation. Against themselves for their neglect. Fear. Of the measures which I might take, if I came to you \"with a rod\" (1 Corinthians 4:21). Vehement desire. Longing that I should return to you (see ver. 7). Zeal. To make up for past remissness. Revenge. Judicial punishment of the incestuous offender. The \"apology\" and \"indignation\" referred to themselves; the \"fear\" and \"yearning\" to the apostle; the \"zeal\" and \"judicial retribution\" to the offender. In all things. His summing up is, \"In every respect ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.\" Whatever may have been your previous carelessness and connivance, the steps you took on receiving my letter vindicated your character. In this matter; rather, in the matter. It is quite in accordance with St. Paul's usual manner that \"he speaks indefinitely of what was odious\" (1 Thessalonians 4:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Wherefore, though I wrote unto you. \"So then, even if I did write you,\" namely, about that matter. For his cause that had done the wrong, etc. My object in writing was not to mix myself up with the personal quarrel. I had in view neither the wronger nor the wronged, directly and primarily, but wrote for the sake of the whole Church (1 Corinthians 5:1, 2; 1 Corinthians 6:7). Nor for his cause that suffered wrong. Apparently the father of the offender (1 Corinthians 5:1). Our care for you, etc. Among the diversity of readings in this clause, which seem to be still further confused by mere mistakes of copyists, the best supported reading is \"your care for us\" (B, C, E, K, L, and various versions, etc.). The Sinaitic manuscript has \"your care for yourselves.\" The variations have partly risen from the apparent strangeness of the remark that his letter had been written in order that their care for him might be manifested to themselves; in other words, that they might learn from their own conduct the reality of their earnest feelings for him. He has already spoken of this \"earnest care\" of theirs (ver. 11), but not in quite the same sense. Certainly, however, the reading followed by our Authorized Version, even if it be a correction, furnishes a more natural meaning (comp. 2 Corinthians 2:4), and the other may have arisen from a clerical error.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Therefore we were comforted, etc. Since my Epistle secured the result of manifesting your true feelings towards me, \"we have been comforted.\" The Revised Version and many editions put the stop here, and continue (reading δὲ after ἐπὶ), and in addition to our consolation, abundantly the more did we rejoice at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. Exceedingly the more. In the Greek this is expressed by double comparatives (comp. 2 Corinthians 12:9; Philippians 1:23). Was refreshed; rather, has been (and is) refreshed. The same verb is used in 1 Corinthians 16:18; Philemon 1:7, 20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I am not ashamed. The due rendering of the tenses brings out the sense much more accurately. \"Because if I have boasted anything to him on your behalf, I was not put to the blush;\" in other words, \"One reason of my exceeding gladness was that you fully justified that very favorable picture of you which I had drawn for Titus when I was urging him to be the bearer of my letter.\" Is found a truth; literally, proved itself to be a truth. Here again there is a most delicate reference to the charge of levity and unveracity which had been brought against him (2 Corinthians 1:17). I always spoke the truth to you; but I might well have feared that, in speaking of you to Titus, my affection for you had led me to overstep the limits of perfect accuracy. But you yourselves, by proving yourselves worthy of all I said of you, have established my perfect truthfulness, even in the only point where I might have thought it doubtful. Nothing could exceed the tact and refinement, the subtle delicacy and beauty, of this gentle remark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - His inward affection. The same word which is so needlessly rendered \"bowels\" in 2 Corinthians 6:12. More abundant. His love for you has been increased by his recent visit. With fear and trembling. On this Pauline phrase, see 1 Corinthians 2:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I rejoice therefore. The \"therefore\" concludes the whole paragraph, but is omitted in many manuscripts. I have confidence in you; literally, I am bold in you; i.e. I feel courage about you. The phrase in 2 Thessalonians 3:4 expresses a calmer and less hazardous trust.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - We do you to wit; rather, we make known to you. The phrase is like the modern \"I wish to inform you.\" In this and the next chapter St. Paul, having fully spoken of the joy which had been caused to him by their reception of his first letter, and having said as much as he then intended to say in answer to the charges insinuated against him, proceeds to give directions about the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem. He had already spoken of it (1 Corinthians 16:1-4), but feared that they were behindhand, and now sends Titus to stimulate their zeal. The style throughout is brief and allusive, because he had already, in various ways, brought this matter fully before them. Throughout this section he shows in a remarkable degree the tact, courtesy, high sense of honour, and practical wisdom which were among his many gifts. The \"but\" with which the chapter begins in the original is St. Paul's ordinary formula of transition, as in 1 Corinthians 7:1; 1 Corinthians 12:1; 1 Corinthians 13:1, etc. (For the phrase, \"we inform you,\" see 1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 Corinthians 15:1.) It is one of numberless incidental proofs of the genuineness of this group of Epistles - the Epistles of the second great missionary journey - that the same words, phrases, and thoughts constantly recur in them. The grace of God (see next note). Bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia; rather, which is being bestowed in the Churches. St. Paul wants to tell the Corinthians how extremely liberal the Macedonians have been, since it was his custom to stir up one Church by the example of another (2 Corinthians 9:2); but he begins by speaking of their generosity as a proof of the grace which they are receiving from the Holy Spirit. The Churches of Macedonia. The only Macedonian Churches of which we have any details in the New Testament are those of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea. They seem to have been peculiarly dear to St. Paul, who was attracted by their cheerfulness in affliction and their generosity in the midst of want.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - In a great trial of affliction; rather, in much testing of affliction; i.e. in an affliction which put to the proof their Christian character. \"They were not simply afflicted,\" says St. Chrysostom, \"but in such a way as also to become approved by their endurance.\" (For the word rendered \"trial,\" see Romans 5:4, and in this Epistle, 2 Corinthians 2:9; 2 Corinthians 9:13; 2 Corinthians 13:3.) \"Affliction\" seems to have befallen the Churches of Macedonia very heavily (1 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:14), chiefly through the jealousy of the Jews, who excited the hatred of the Gentiles (Acts 16:20; Acts 17:5, 13). The abundance of their joy. Another reference to joy in sadness (see on 2 Corinthians 7:4). There is not the least necessity to understand the verb \"is\" or \"was\" after this clause. \"The abundance... abounded\" is indeed a pleonasm, but is not at all unlike the style of St. Paul. He means to say that their joy overflowed their affliction, and their liberality overflowed their poverty (Mark 12:44). Their deep poverty; literally, their pauperism to the depth; their abysmal penury. Though they were βαθύπτωχοι, they showed themselves in generosity to be βαθυπλουτοι. Stanley refers to Arnold's 'Roman Commonwealth,' where he mentions that the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia, which had suffered greatly in the three civil wars, appealed successfully to Tiberius for a diminution of their burdens. The gift of the Macedonians was like the widow's mite (Luke 21:3, 4, where similar words occur - perisseuo, husterema). Of their liberality; rather, of their singleness of purpose or simplicity (Ephesians 6:5). The \"grace\" and single-heartedness to which he alludes showed themselves in liberality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They were willing of themselves. \"Of their own accord,\" as in ver. 17. The verb in the original is energetically omitted, with the \"they gave\" of ver. 5. St. Paul does not mean that the notion of making the collection originated with them (2 Corinthians 9:2), but only that they displayed a voluntary energy in carrying it out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Praying us. The entreaties came from them, not from me. That we would receive. These words are almost certainly an explanatory gloss. The translation then is, \"begging us for the grace of participation in this ministration to the saints.\" They were so willing in the matter that they entreated me, as a favour (χάρις), to allow them to have a share in this contribution, because it was to be given to the saints, that is, the suffering peer in the Church of Jerusalem. This Church suffered from chronic poverty. Even the Jewish population were liable to famines, in one of which they had only been kept alive by the royal munificence of a proselyte, Queen Helena,of Adiabene. The Christians would, of course, suffer even more deeply, because they were drawn from the humblest classes and had fewer friends. This was one of the reasons why, as an act of common humanity, it was incumbent on the Gentile Christians to help them (Acts 11:29; Romans 15:25, 26). St. Paul had already brought the subject to the notice of the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 16:1-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Not as we hoped; rather, not as we expected. They were so poor that it was impossible to expect much from them, but they surpassed my expectations in every way. The Church of Philippi, perhaps under the influence of Lydia, was remarkable for generosity, and was the only Church from which St. Paul would accept any personal help (Philippians 2:25; Philippians 4:15-18). First. \"They gave themselves to the Lord, which is the best of all, and they gave themselves as helpers to us also - by the will of God.\" (For a similar use of \"and\" to imply a matter of less importance, see Acts 15:28.) The phrase, \"by the will of God,\" implies thanksgiving to God for the grace which enabled them to give themselves to him, and their goods to his saints. Being \"a peculiar people,\" they naturally showed themselves \"zealous of good works\" (Titus 2:14). First (Romans 1:16; Romans 2:9, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInsomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Insomuch that. Their liberality encouraged me so greatly that I exhorted Titus to return to Corinth once more, and see whether he could not receive some proof that you were equally liberal. The remarks that follow are full of delicate reserve, but under their exquisite tact and urbanity we can perceive that the Corinthians had talked very loudly about their contributions, and had promised with great zeal, but had shown themselves somewhat slack in redeeming their promises. We exhorted Titus. It is curious that this word is constantly used of the missions of Titus (ver. 17; 2 Corinthians 12:18; 1 Corinthians 16:12). As he had began. \"That as no inaugurated (this collection), so he would also complete towards you this gracious work also.\" Among other works of grace which Titus might complete by returning to them from Macedonia was the kindly collection which he had begun to set on foot in his previous visit (2 Corinthians 12:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Therefore; rather, but. In the following verses to ver. 15 he tells them his wishes about this collection. He desires them to show generosity among their other graces (ver. 7), not by way of command, but that they may emulate others and show their love (ver. 8) by following the example of Christ (ver. 9). And by acting thus they would prove the sincerity of their former promises (vers. 10, 11), especially as he did not wish them to give more than they could justly spare by way of reciprocity (vers. 12-15). As ye abound in every thing, in faith, etc. Perhaps \"by faith,\" etc., \"St. Paul,\" says Grotius, \"knew the art of the orators to move by praising.\" This method of conciliating attention is technically called proparaitesis. The praise was, of course, sincere, though, no doubt, it was expressed with the generosity of love (see 1 Corinthians 1:5). And in your love to us. The Greek is more emphatic,\" and by the love from you in us;\" i.e. by the love which streams from you, and which I feel in myself. In this grace also; namely, the grace of Christian liberality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Not by commandment. St. Paul felt an honourable sensibility which prevented him from straining his authority by urging the Corinthians to give of their substance. Among Gentiles such contributions towards the needs of others - the result of unselfish compassion - were all but unknown. The forwardness; i.e. the ready zeal. The sincerity; more literally, the genuineness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. The word \"grace,\" as in vers. 4, 6, 7, here means \"gracious beneficence.\" Though he was rich (John 16:15; Ephesians 3:8). Became poor. The aorist implies the concentration of his self-sacrifice in a single act. By his poverty. The word \"his\" in the Greek implies the greatness of Christ. The word for \"poverty\" would, in classical Greek, mean \"pauperism\" or \"mendicancy.\" Dean Stanley (referring to Milman's 'Latin Christianity,' 5. bk. 12. c. 6) points out how large a place this verse occupied in the mediaeval controversies between the moderate and the extreme members of the mendicant orders. William of Ockham and others, taking the word \"poverty\" in its extremest sense, maintained that the Franciscans ought to possess nothing; but Pope John XXII., with the Dominicans, took a more rational view of the sense and of the historic facts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And herein I give my advice; and in this matter I offer an opinion (only). For this is expedient for you. It is more to your advantage that I should merely suggest and advise you about the matter than command you. Who have begun; rather, seeing that you formerly began. The verb is the same as in ver. 6. Not only to do, but also to be forward; rather, not only to do, but also to be willing. The \"to do\" is in the aorist, the \"to be willing\" in the present. We should naturally have expected a reversed order, \"not only to be willing, but also to put in action.\" There must be a strong touch of irony in the words, unless we interpret it to mean \"not only to make the collection, but to be willing to add yet more to it.\" Perhaps in the \"to be willing\" lies the notion of \"the cheerful giver,\" \"the willing mind \"(ch. 9:7; 1 Timothy 6:17-19). A year ago; rather, since the previous year; i.e. last year (ch. 9:2). They had probably begun to collect in the previous Easter, and it was now soon after Tisri, or September, the beginning of the Jewish civil year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now therefore perform the doing of it, etc.; \"but now complete also the actual work, in order that, as was the readiness of the willing, so may be also the completion according to your means.\" Out of that which ye have. This, and not \"out of your ability,\" is probably the right reading, as we see from the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For if there be first a willing mind, etc. \"For if the readiness is forth- coming, it is acceptable,\" etc. In other words, God considers not quantum, but ex quanto; not the magnitude of the gift, but the proportion which it bears to the means of the giver.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And ye be burdened; literally, for not that there may be relief to others, but to you affliction. In other words, I have no wish that you should distress yourselves to set others at ease. You must not suspect me of Jewish proclivities which would lead me to impoverish you to provide luxuries for the Christians at Jerusalem. Others refer it to the Macedonians: \"I do not wish to burden you, but the Macedonians, who are poor, have contributed, and if you join them in this good work now they may help you hereafter.\" But there is no hint of this anywhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But by an equality, etc. The verse, like so many in this chapter, is expressed very elliptically: \"But by a reciprocal fairness in the present case, your superabundance to their lack, that also their superabundance may be in proportion to your lack, that there may come to be reciprocal fairness.\" St. Paul may possibly be thinking of the reciprocity of spiritual and temporal benefits, as in Romans 15:27; but if so he leaves the thought unexpressed. The application of the text to \"works of supererogation\" (Art. XIV.), as forming a fund at the disposal of the hierarchy in the way of indulgences, pardons, etc., is a singular perversion. The passage has been pointed out by Dean Stanley as one which indicates a possible acquaintance with the writings of Aristotle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - As it is written (Exodus 16:17, 18, LXX.). The reference is to the gathering of manna.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Which put; rather, which giveth. The zeal is continuous. The same earnest care. The same in the heart of Titus as in my own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The exhortation. My request that he would undertake this task. Being more forward. Because he was more earnestly zealous than I had ever ventured to hope, he went spontaneously. (On the word authairetos, see ver. 3.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The brother, whose praise is in the gospel. The phrase means, \"whose worth is praised wherever the glad tidings are preached.\" There can be no reference to any of the four written Gospels, for they were not in the hands of Christians till a later date; nor did the word \"gospel\" acquire this significance till afterwards. From Acts 20:5, it is somewhat precariously inferred that St. Luke is meant. Others have conjectured Barnabas, Silas (who are out of the question), Erastus, Mark, a brother of Titus, etc. St. Luke is not unlikely to have been selected as a delegate by the Church of Philippi; but further than this we can say nothing. St. Luke was not a Macedonian by birth, and any Macedonian (e.g., Aristarchus, Sopater, Secundus, Epaphroditus) seems to be excluded by 2 Corinthians 9:4. Palsy notes it as curious that the object of St. Paul's journey to Jerusalem, Which is so prominent in this group of Epistles, is only mentioned indirectly and incidentally by St. Luke (Acts 24:17) in the Acts of the Apostles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Chosen. The word (literally, chosen by show of hands) implies a popular vote (comp. 1 Corinthians 16:3, 4). This brother Was not only widely known and valued, but also specially selected for this task. To travel with us. \"As our fellow traveller.\" The word occurs in Acts 19:29. With this grace. The better reading is \"in:\" \"in this matter of kindness.\" To the glory of the same Lord. The word \"same\" should be omitted. And declaration of your ready mind. The best reading is \"our,\" and the clause should be rendered, to further the glory of the Lord and our readiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAvoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Avoiding this. The object in sending Titus and the brother was to cut away the possibility of blame and suspicion. The word \"avoiding\" (stellomenoi) literally means \"furling sail,\" and then \"taking precautions.\" It may, however, mean \"making this arrangement\" (see 2 Thessalonians 3:6). Too much stress has been laid on St. Paul's \"use of nautical terms\" (Acts 20:20; Galatians 2:12, etc.). They belong, in fact, to the very phraseology of the Greek language. That no man should blame us (see 2 Corinthians 6:3). St. Paul here sets a valuable and necessary example to all Christians who are entrusted with the management of charitable funds. It is their duty to take every step which may place them above the possibility of of suspicion. Their management of the sums entrusted to them should be obviously and transparently business-like and honourable. St. Paul taught this behaviour both by example and by precept (Romans 12:17; Philippians 4:8). There is such a thing as a foolish and reprehensible indifference to public opinion (1 Peter 2:12). Yet with all his noble carefulness, St. Paul did not escape this very slander (2 Corinthians 12:18). In this abundance. The word, which occurs here only, means literally \"succulence,\" but in the LXX. the adjective means \"rich\" (1 Kings 1:9). It here implies that the sum which had been collected by St. Paul's exertion was a large one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTProviding for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Honest things. The word \"honest\" means \"honourable\" (Romans 12:17; Proverbs 3:4, LXX.). Not only in the sight of the Lord. Such precautions would be unnecessary if others were not concerned, for God knows our honesty (2 Corinthians 5:11). But also before men. Although the text \"avoid all appearance of evil\" should be rendered \"avoid every species of evil,\" the mistranslation conveys a wise lesson. \"In a field of melons,\" says the Chinese proverb. \"do not stoop to tie your shoe;\" for that will look as if you wanted to steal one of the melons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Our brother. It is impossible to conjecture with any certainty who was the brother thus warmly eulogized. Clement, Epaenetus, Apollos, Luke, Zenas, Sosthenes, Trophimus, and Tychicus have all been suggested. Stanley conjectures that the two who accompanied Titus were the Ephesians Tychicus and Trophimus (Acts 20:4; Acts 21:9; 2 Timothy 4:12; Ephesians 6:21; Titus 3:12; Colossians 4:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Whether any do inquire of Titus; literally, whether about Titus, or, as to Titus; i.e. \"if I speak about Titus.\" (For the phrase, comp. ch. 1:6, 8; 2 Thessalonians 2:1.) Titus, long afterwards, was delegated on a similar mission to Crete (Titus 1:1-5; Titus 2:15). My partner and fellow helper concerning you; rather, my associate (Philemon 1:17) and, as regards you, my fellow worker. Messengers; literally, apostles. The word is used in its original and untechnical sense of delegates (Philippians 2:25; Romans 16:7). The glory of Christ. Men whose work and worth redound to Christ's honour (Galatians 1:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Of your love.

Show to the Church that my boasting of you was justifiable.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Cor.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - For. This word shows that he is continuing the same subject, and therefore excludes the supposition that this chapter is a separate letter or fragment. No doubt, however, the express mention of the collection after he has been practically writing about it through the whole of the last chapter looks as if he had been interrupted, or had left off dictating at the end of the last verse. Such breaks must often and necessarily have occurred in the dictation of the Epistles, and doubtless help to account for some of their phenomena. Perhaps, on reperusing the last paragraphs before resuming the subject he observed that, after all, he had not directly mentioned the contribution, and therefore explains that he thought it superfluous to do so. To the saints. The poor Christians of Jerusalem (2 Corinthians 8:4). Superfluous. Because the subject had been already fully brought to their notice by himself and by Titus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I boast of you; literally, I am boasting. The tense shows that he is writing from Macedonia, probably from Philippi (2 Corinthians 8:24). Achaia (see 2 Corinthians 1:1). Was ready a year ago; has been prepared since last year. Your zeal hath provoked very many; literally, zeal from you hath stimulated the majority. \"Zeal from you\" means zeal which emanated from the Corinthians and aroused emulation in others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But. Though it is needless to write to you about this collection, I sent the brethren to make sure that all I had said about you might be justified by reality. In this behalf; i.e. about this matter (comp. 2 Corinthians 3:10), or, as we might express it, \"in this direction.\" He seems to have felt more uncertainty about their liberality than about other matters (2 Corinthians 7:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They of Macedonia; rather, Macedonians; i.e. any friends from Macedonia (Acts 20:4). Shall Achaians have to blush before Macedonians? We, that we say not ye. Nothing can exceed the delicacy of this touch. St. Paul asks them to be ready with their contributions for his sake, not for their own; that he may not have to blush for his generous words respecting them, whereas really the discredit would be simply theirs. Confident boasting; rather, confidence. The reading \"of boasting\" is not genuine here. For the word hypostasis in the sense of \"confidence,\" see 2 Corinthians 11:17; Hebrews 3:4. The use of the word to represent the \"Persons\" of the Blessed Trinity is later. The other sense of the word, \"substance\" (or underlying base of attributes), is found in Hebrews 1:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That they would go before unto you. The triple repetition of the word \"before\" shows how earnest St. Paul is in the matter. The Corinthians had promised largely; it was evident that there had been, or that there was ground for fearing that there might be, some slackness of performance. St. Paul was so unwilling to have seemed inaccurate in what, he had said about them in Macedonia that he wished to give them ample notice before the Macedonian delegates arrived. Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before; your previously promised blessing, bounty; literally, blessing. The mere word should have acted as an inducement to generosity. See the use of the word to express a generous gift in Genesis 33:11; Judges 1:15, etc. (LXX.); Ephesians 1:3. In this sense it resembles the Hebrew berachah (Joshua 15:19, etc.). As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness; as a blessing, and not as an extortion; i.e. as a free gift of your own, and not as something which I had wrung from you, or \"got out of you\" (2 Corinthians 7:2; 2 Corinthians 12:17, 18). It is less likely that the word pleonexia refers to the \"parsimony\" of the Corinthians, as though the smallness of their gift would show their greed for large gains.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But this I say. The Greek only has \"But this.\" The ellipse can hardly be \"I say.\" It is an accusative used absolutely - \"as to their.\" Compare \"But one thing\" (Philippians 3:14). Shall reap also sparingly. In the Greek the more emphatic order is \"sparingly also shall reap.\" The metaphor of the harvest implies that the more generous the gift the richer will be the return; and that \"withholding more than is meet\" will only tend to poverty (Proverbs 11:24, 25; Proverbs 19:17; Proverbs 22:9). (For \"sowing\" and \"reaping\" in this connection, comp. 1 Corinthians 9:11.) Bountifully; literally, with blessings; Vulgate, in benedictionibus (comp. Galatians 6:7, 8). Bountifulness blesses both him that gives and him that takes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In his heart. The heart must not only go with but anticipate the hand. Grudgingly; literally, from grief (Exodus 25:2; Romans 12:8). A cheerful giver. The phrase is from the addition to Proverbs 22:8, which is found in the LXX.; except that \"loveth\" is substituted for \"blesseth.\" Compare \"He that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness\" (Romans 12:8). The rabbis said that cheerful kindness, even if nothing was given, was better than a morose gift.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - To make all grace abound toward you. God can give you such abundant gifts that you will not feel the loss of a generous contribution to his service. Sufficiency. The word autarkeia (1 Timothy 6:6) in the Stoic philosophy was used for the perfect independence which enabled a man to stand alone. The term is here softened and Christianized to express the contentment which arises from the full supply of all our needs by God. The affirmations of the original are as emphatic as language can make them. They express that the man who places all his trust upon God will be \"perfect and entire, lacking nothing\" (Philippians 4:11, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As it is written. The quotation is from the LXX. in Psalm 112:9. He hath dispersed abroad. He has been a large and generous giver. The poor. The word here used is penes, which does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means moderato and honourable poverty, whereas in classical Greek ptocheia implies disreputable pauperism and mendicancy (comp. 2 Corinthians 8:9). His righteousness. Meaning here his good deeds. The word is often rendered \"pity\" by the LXX. (eleemosune, from which word comes our \"alms\"), and this word occurs as a synonymous reading in Matthew 6:1. Remaineth forever.

The verb used is epichoregein, to furnish abundantly. At Athens a choragus was one who furnished a chorus, and as this was a leitourgia (or \"public service\"), involving great expense, and often discharged with extreme munificence, the verb came to imply \"provide abundantly.\" St. Paul may (so to speak) have \"picked up the word\" at Athens. Seed to the sower (Isaiah 55:10). Both minister. The true reading almost certainly is \"will both supply bread for food, and will multiply your seed for sowing, and will increase the fruits of your righteousness\" (see Isaiah 55:10, LXX.). The fruits of your righteousness (Hosea 10:12, LXX.). In \"righteousness,\" as in all things else, it is God only who \"gives the increase\" (1 Corinthians 3:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeing enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To all bountifulness; rather, to all simplicity, or \"singleness of heart\" (2 Corinthians 8:2).

The word \"liturgy,\" here rendered \"service,\" is used in the same connection in Romans 15:27. Generally it means \"religious service\" (Acts 13:6; Philippians 2:17; Hebrews 10:11). Here it more resembles its classic sense of \"a public office discharged for the good of the state,\" such as undertaking the office of a choragus (see ver. 10). Not only. St. Paul is anxious to emphasize the religious side of the contribution fully as much as its philanthropic object. Is abundant.

For your professed subjection; literally, for the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ. And for your liberal distribution unto them; rather, and for the simplicity of your fellowship towards them. A large contribution would prove two things; namely,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the Corinthians showed due subjection to the truths and duties which they theoretically accepted as resulting from the gospel; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that they were united to their Jewish-Christian brethren and to all others in single-hearted fellowship. It is very doubtful whether haplotes ever means \"liberality,\" and koinonia is here better understood of \"communion\" than of \"communication.\" Unto all men. For if the Corinthians behaved with such brotherly kindness to the once-despised Jews, who were now their Christian brethren, they would be not likely to refuse fellowship with any others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And by their prayer for you. These words are joined by our Authorized Version with \"glorifying God.\" The saints at Jerusalem would, in consequence of the proved sincerity of the Corinthians, glorify God with thanksgiving for their faithfulness and kindness, by prayer for them. The Revisers take the clause with the following participle, \"while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.\" This is the only right view of the construction. Long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you; literally, yearn for you because of the grace of God which overabounds to you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Corinthians9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thanks be unto God. Nothing ever seems so much to disburden the full heart of St. Paul after deep emotion as an utterance of thanksgiving (Romans 7:25; Romans 9:5; Romans 11:33; 1 Corinthians 15:57; Galatians 1:5; 1 Timothy 1:17). The thanksgiving here is like a great sigh of relief. The subject of it is perfectly general. It is not a mere \"Amen\" uttered, as it were, by St. Paul at the end of the thanksgivings of the saints at Jerusalem which he has been presupposing; but an offering of thanks to God for the issues of grace in general, all summed up in one act of \"inestimable love\" (John 3:16; Romans 6:23; Romans 11:33; Ephesians 3:19).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
