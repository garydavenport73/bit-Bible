Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; alluding to the astrological calculations based upon extraordinary appearances in the sky. Diodorus Siculus remarks 2:30) - and his statement is fully confirmed by the Babylonian cuneiform tablets - that \"the appearance of comets, eclipses of the sun and moon, earthquakes, and in fact every kind of change occasioned by the atmosphere, whether good or bad, both to nations and to kings and private individuals [were omens of future events].\" A catalogue of the seventy standard astrological tablets is to be found in the third volume of the British Museum collection of inscriptions. Among the items we read, \"A collection of twenty-five tablets of the signs of heaven and earth, according to their good presage and their bad;\" and again, \"Tablets [regarding] the signs of the heaven, along with the star (comet) which has a corona in front and a tail behind; the appearance of the sky,\" etc. There can hardly be a doubt that the prophetic writer had such pseudo-science as this in his eye (see Professor Sayce, 'The Astronomy and Astrology of the Baby. Ionians, with translations of the tablets,' ere, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, 3:145-339).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The customs of the people. \"People\" should, as usual, be corrected into peoples - the heathen nations are referred to. The Hebrew has \"the statutes;\" but the Authorized Version is substantially right, customs having a force as of iron in Eastern countries. It seems to be implied that the \"customs\" are of religious origin (setup. 2 Kings 17:8, where \"the statutes of the heathen\" are obviously the rites and customs of polytheism. For one cutteth a tree, etc. This is intended to prove the foregoing statement of the \"vanity,\" or groundlessness, of idolatry. The order of the Hebrew, however, is more forcible, for as wood out of the forest one cutteth it, viz. the idol.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They deck it... that it move not. The close resemblance of this verse to Isaiah 40:19, 20; Isaiah 41:7, will strike every reader. \"Move\" should rather be totter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They are upright as the palm tree; rather, they are like a pillar (i.e. a scarecrow) in a field of cucumbers. This is the interpretation given to our passage in Ver. 70 of the apocryphal Epistle o! Jeremiah (written in the Maccabean period, evidently with reference to our prophecy), and is much more striking than the rival translation, \"like a palm tree of turned work,\" i.e. stiff, immovable (comp. Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:110, 111; Horace, 'Sat.,' 1. 8, 1-4). They must needs be borne... they cannot do evil; a reminiscence, apparently, of Isaiah 46:7; Isaiah 41:23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Forasmuch as there is none; rather, so that, etc. But practically it is merely a strengthened negative. There is none like unto thee; none, that is, among those who claim to have Divine power (comp. the phrase, \"God of gods,\" Deuteronomy 10:17; Psalm 136:2). It would appear from some passages, however, as if the heathen did not worship mere nonentities (though idols are sometimes called \"things of naught,\" e.g., ten times by Isaiah) by comparison with Jehovah, but that there was a dark background of awful personal or quasi-personal reality (e.g., Deuteronomy 4:7; 2 Chronicles 28:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - O King of nations. As time went on, the sacred writers became more and more distinct in their assertions of the truth that Jehovah, the Self-revealing God, is not Israel's King only, but also of the world (comp. Psalm 22:28; Psalm 47:7, 8; Psalm 96:10). To thee doth it appertain; viz. that men should fear thee. Forasmuch as, etc. (see above, on Ver. 6). Among all the wise men. \"Men\" is supplied, but doubtless rightly. It is a contest - how unequal a one! - between Jehovah and the sages of the heathen (comp. \"Yet he also is wise,\" Isaiah 31:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Brutish and foolish. In fact, the original meaning of the idolatrous religions had begun, probably, to fade, and the worship of Bel and Nebo had become (as the worship of the Egyptian gods became at a later period) increasingly formal and ritualistic. The stock is a doctrine of vanities; rather, an instruction of vanities; i.e. all that the idols can teach is vanities. Against this is the plural (\"vanities,\" not vanity); it is more natural (and also more in accordance with usage; comp. Genesis 41:26, Hebrew) to render, the instruction of the vanities is wooden (\"vanities\" has the constant technical sense of \"idols;\" see Jeremiah 8:19; Jeremiah 14:22; Deuteronomy 32:21; Psalm 31:6). The clause then furnishes a reason for the folly of the heathen; how should they attain to more than a \"wooden\" knowledge, when the idols themselves are but wood? A bitter truth in an ironical form.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSilver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This verse apparently once followed Ver. 5. Like Vers. 7 and 8, it is omitted in the Septuagint. Silver spread into plates, etc. The silver and gold were meant for the coating of the wooden image (comp. Isaiah 30:22; Isaiah 40:19). Tarshish; i.e. Tartessus, in south-west Spain, between the two mouths of the Baetis, or Guadal-quivir. Gold from Uphaz. A place bearing this name, or anything like it, is not known from other sources than the Old Testament writings; and hence a corruption of the text has naturally been suspected (Ophir into Uphaz). As, however, r and z are not easily confounded, either in the earlier or the later Hebrew characters, this view must be abandoned, though it has the authority of several ancient versions of this passage (including the Peshite and the Targum). The name occurs again in Daniel 10:5. The Peshite, moreover, curiously enough, translates zahab mufaz in 1 Kings 10:18 (Authorized Version, \"the best gold\") by \"gold from Ophir.\" Blue and purple. The Hebrew has no word, strictly speaking, for either \"blue\" or \"purple.\" Both these words here used probably express coloring matter rather than colors (this is certain of the latter word, which properly designates a kind of mussel, the shell of which yielded dye). The first produced a violet purple, the second a reddish purple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The true God; literally, a God in truth, the accusative of apposition being chosen instead of the usual genitive construction, to emphasize the idea of \"truth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thus shall ye say, etc. This verse is, unlike the rest of the chapter, written in Chaldee, and greatly interrupts the connection. Whether it is a fragment of a Targum (or Chaldee paraphrase) representing a Hebrew verse really written by Jeremiah, or whether it is a marginal note by some scribe or reader which has found its way by accident into the text, cannot be positively determined. What is certain is that it is not in its right place, though it already stood here when the Septuagint Version of Jeremiah was made. To argue, with the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the latter circumstance is decisive of the correctness of the passage in its present position, implies a view of the unchangeableness of the text in the early centuries which few leading scholars will admit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-16. - Repeated with a slight variation in Jeremiah 51:15-19. Verse 12. - He hath made the earth, etc. (comp. the frequent references to the Divine creatorship in the latter part of Isaiah (Isaiah 40:22; Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:24; Isaiah 45:12, 18; Isaiah 51:13). By his discretion; rather, by his understanding.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - When he uttereth his voice, etc. The phrase is difficult, but the Authorized Version probably gives the right sense. God's \"voice\" is the thunder (Psalm 29:3), which is accompanied by the gathering of heavy clouds (\"His pavilion round about him,\" Psalm 18:11). He causeth the vapors to ascend, etc.; the storm-clouds coming up more and more thickly from the horizon. From this point the verse agrees with Psalm 135:7 (the psalm is full of such reminiscences, and is obviously very late). Lightning's with rain; rather, for the rain. The lightning's are, as it were, the heralds or attendants of the rain. The wind out of his treasures; a noble figure, used elsewhere of the snow and hail (Job 38:22), and of the waters of the sea (Psalm 33:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Before these natural miracles, all men, except those who have been enlightened by revelation, are without knowledge (so, and not in his knowledge, we ought to render); i.e. without insight into their origin and meaning (compare the overwhelming series of questions in the sublime theophany in Job, ch. Job 38, 39.). Every founder is confounded by, etc.; rather, every goldsmith is brought to shame by the graven image; for how can the work which has needed all the resources of his skill deliver him?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The very essence of idols is vanity; they are unreal as \"a breath;\" they are, not so much the work of errors as a work of mockery, i.e. not opus rise dignum, but a work which rewards the efforts bestowed upon its production by disappointment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The portion of Jacob; i.e. Jehovah. The phrase appears to have been coined at a lower level of religion, when every nation was supposed to have its own patron deity; just as the prophet says, ironically, to the fetish-worshippers of Israel, \"Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion\" (Isaiah 57:5), and Moses, in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:19), speaks of the host of heaven as having been \"divided [i.e. assigned] unto all nations under the whole heaven.\" But, of course, the phrase is susceptible of a high, spiritual application (comp. Psalm 16:5; Psalm 142:5). God's people are, by their very conception, an ἐκλογὴ, chosen out by God, and choosing him, and not the world, for their portion. \"Making the best of both worlds\" is an object implicitly condemned by this consecrated phrase. The former of all things. How much more forcible is the original phrase: \"... of the whole,\" i.e. the universe! \"To form\" is a phrase constantly used of God in the second part of Isaiah. The rod of his inheritance. \"Rod\" should rather be tribe. The twelve tribes had an inner unity, as contrasted with other peoples; comp. Psalm 74:2 and Isaiah 63:17 (\"tribes\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-22. - This passage connects itself immediately with Jeremiah 9, where the invasion of Judah and the dispersion of its inhabitants have been foretold. Here, after describing dramatically the departure of the latter into exile, the prophet reports a distinct revelation of the same fact, so that this can no longer be assumed to be mere imaginative rhetoric. The Jewish people is then introduced, lamenting her sad fate, but expressing resignation. Verse 17. - Gather up thy wares. \"Wares\" should rather be bundle. There is no allusion to trafficking. O inhabitant of the fortress; rather, thou that dwellest besieged.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I will sling out; a forcible image, to express the violence of the expulsion; comp. Isaiah 22:17, 18 (Ver. 17 needs correcting). At this once; rather, at this time (comp. Jeremiah 16:21). Invasion was no novelty to the Jews, but had hitherto merely produced loss of goods rather than of personal liberty. That they may find it so; better, that they may feel it. Others supply as. the subject \"Jehovah,\" comparing Psalm 32:6, \"In a time of finding (Authorized Version, \"When thou mayest be found\"). Jeremiah himself says, \"Ye shall seek me, and shall find, when ye shall search for me with all your heart\" (Jeremiah 29:13 - Deuteronomy 4:29). Still, these passages are hardly quite parallel, as the object of the verb can be easily supplied from the connection. The Vulgate apparently reads the text with different vowels, for it renders ut inveniantur; the Septuagint has \"that thy stroke may be found.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - It is rather doubtful (as in the parallel passage, Jeremiah 4:19-21) whether the speaker here is the prophet, or \"the daughter of my people,\" who, in Jeremiah 6:26, is called upon to \"make most bitter lamentation.\" Of course, the prophet cannot dissociate himself from his people; and we rosy therefore, perhaps, consider both references united. Hurt; literally, breach; a term so used for political calamities. A grief; rather, my grief; but \"grief\" is meant to include both physical and mental sufferings (literally, my sickness).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - My tabernacle; rather, my tent. It is very striking how present to the minds of the Israelites was the consciousness of their pastoral origin. Hence the cry, \"To your tents, O Israel\" (1 Kings 12:16); comp. also, \"And the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as aforetime\" (2 Kings 13:5). My cords ... my curtains. The \"cords ' are those which, by being fastened to poles and stakes, keep the tent steady; the \"curtains,\" of course, are the covering of the tent (comp. Isaiah 54:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The pastors; i.e. the civil authorities (see on Jeremiah 2:8). They shall not prosper; rather, they have not prospered; or, better still, they have not acted wisely, the notion of prospering being rather suggested than expressed (the same word is used in Isaiah lit. 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Behold... is come; rather; Hark! Tidings! Behold, it cometh! The tidings are that the foe is at hand, advancing with a great commotion, with clashing spears, prancing horses, and all the hubbub of a great army. A den of dragons; rather, of jackals (as Jeremiah 9:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-25. - These verses confirm the view taken above, of the speaker of this whole section. Jeremiah and the people, each is, in a sense, the speaker; but here the prophetic faith seems to run rather in advance of that of his fellow-countrymen. They form, however, a fitting sequel to the charges brought against the people in Jeremiah 9. The speaker admits that he (either the People of Judah personified, or Jeremiah as a representative of its best portion) fully deserves chastisement for having attempted to go his own way (comp. Isaiah 57:17). He has now attained an insight into the truth that man's duty is simply to walk in the path which God has marked out for him. He only asks that Jehovah would chastise him with judgment, or,, more clearly, according to what is just. The contrast is between punishment inflicted in anger, the object of which is to cause pain to the criminal, and that inflicted as a duty of justice, and of which the object is the criminal's reformation\" (Payne Smith). The fear expressed, however, is not exactly lest thou bring me to nothing, which is too strong for the Hebrew, but lest thou make me small. Israel was secured against annihilation by the promise of Jehovah, but feared he might possibly survive only as the shadow of his former self.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - This verse is repeated, with slight differences, in Psalm 79:6, 7. The fault of the heathen is that they exceeded their commission (Isaiah 10:6, 7; Isaiah 47:6; Zechariah 1:15), and aimed at destroying, instead of merely punishing, Jehovah's erring people. His habitation; rather, his pasture (comp. Jeremiah 12:10)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Hear ye... and speak. To whom is this addressed? To Jeremiah and his disciples. The Septuagint, indeed, followed by Hitzig and Graf, read (instead of \"speak ye\"), \"Thou shalt speak unto them,\" adopting one different vowel-point. But this involves an inconsistency with the first verb, and is not at all necessary, for why should we suppose Jeremiah to have been completely isolated? If the prophet had well-wishers even among the princes, it stands to reason that he must have had more pronounced adherents in the classes less influenced by the prejudices of society.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Here begins a series of direct references to Deuteronomy, determining the date of the discourse. Cursed be the man, etc.; alluding to Deuteronomy 27:26 (which has, however, not \"obeyeth,\" but \"confirmeth,\" i.e. ratifieth as his own personal rule of conduct. The words of this covenant; rather, the words of this ordinance. The rendering \"covenant,\" however, is not so much erroneous as unsuitable in this context; it is a secondary meaning of the Hebrew b'rith, the original sense being rather \"authoritative appointment\" (from barah, to cut, hence to decide). Nothing, perhaps, is so injurious to a correct understanding of the Scriptures as persistently rendering a Hebrew or Greek word by the same supposed equivalent. \"Covenant\" is no doubt appropriate in some passages (e.g. Joshua 9:6; 1 Samuel 18:3), because an \"appointment\" between men, if equals, involves \"giving and taking;\" but is inadequate when the parties are not equals, and most of all when the superior party is the Divine Being. In these cases we must clearly recur to the original meaning of\" appointment\" or \"ordinance;\" and we have one such case here (see also Hosea 6:7; 2 Kings 11:4; Job 31:1; Psalm 105:10; but not Genesis 17:9). Διαθήκη (1, an arrangement; 2, a will or testament; 3, a covenant) is to some extent parallel (see Cremer's 'Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New Testament Greek,' s.v.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - From the iron furnace; rather, out of the iron furnace. It is Egypt which is thus described (comp. Deuteronomy 4:20; 1 Kings 8:51). The oppression in Egypt was like the furnace in which iron is rendered malleable by heat (so Isaiah 48:10, \"I have tested thee in the furnace of affliction\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The oath which I have sworn (so Deuteronomy 7:8; comp. 8:18). As it is this day; a Deuteronomic formula (see e.g. Deuteronomy 2:30; Deuteronomy 4:20), appealing to the test of experience. So be it, O Lord. The-Hebrew has \"Amen, Jehovah.\" \"Amen\" equivalent to \"true, faithful, trustworthy;\" or used in this way as a formula of asseveration, \"may it be verified by facts\" (the Septuagint has γένοιτο); comp. Jeremiah 28:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Proclaim all these words, etc. This command probably points to a missionary circuit of Jeremiah, as suggested above. Others render, \"read aloud\" (comp. 2 Kings 22:8, Hebrew); but Jeremiah receives the direction to \"proclaim\" or \"cry\" elsewhere (Jeremiah 2:2; Jeremiah 3:12, etc.). So Gabriel, in the Koran, directs Mohammed to \"cry,\" i.e. to proclaim or preach (Sura 96:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - A condensation of Jeremiah 7:23-26. Imagination; rather, stubbornness (see on Jeremiah 3:17). I will bring; rather, I brought. All the words. \"Word\" sometimes means \"thing spoken of;\" here, for instance, the curses specified in Deuteronomy 28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A conspiracy. The language is figurative. Jehovah is the King of Israel; to commit sin is \"to rebel against\" him (Authorized Version sometimes weakens this into \"transgress'); and to encourage one another in wickedness is \"to conspire against\" God. We need not suppose any open combination against spiritual religion; it is enough if\" the spirit of the time\" was directly contrary to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Their forefathers. The Hebrew has \"their fathers, the former ones.\" The allusion is to the sins of the Israelites in the wilderness, and in Canaan under the judges. The prophets are constantly pointing their hearers back to those early times, either for warning (as here) or for encouragement (Jeremiah 2:1; Hosea 2:15; Isaiah 1:26; Isaiah 63:11, 13). And they went after; rather and they (themselves) have gone after. The pronoun is expressed in the Hebrew, to indicate that the prophet's contemporaries are now the subject.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - A summary of Jeremiah's usual prophecies (comp. Jeremiah 4:6; Jeremiah 6:19; Jeremiah 19:3; and especially Jeremiah 2:28; 7:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - That shameful thing; rather, the shame. The name Baal is changed, to mark the abhorrence of the speaker, into Bosheth (see Jeremiah 3:24). Manasseh, we are told, \"raised up altars for Baal\" (2 Kings 21:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Therefore pray not thou, etc. First Jehovah declares that even the intercession of the prophet will be of no avail (see on Jeremiah 7:16), and then that the belated supplications of the people themselves will be ineffectual to avert the calamity. For their trouble. The four most ancient versions, and some of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, read \"in the time of their trouble\" (as in Ver. 12). The confusion between the two readings is easy, and the reading of the versions is to be preferred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - What hath my beloved to do in mine house? \"My beloved\" is evidently the Jewish people, who in Jeremiah 12:7 is called \"the dearly beloved of my soul.\" The Divine Speaker expresses surprise that one who has now so poor a claim to the title of \"my beloved\" should appear in his holy house. It is spoken in the spirit of that earlier revelation of Isaiah, \"When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?\" (Isaiah 1:12). The Jews, it would seem, came to the temple to pray, but their prayer is not accepted, because it is associated with unholy practices. They thought by formal prayers and sacrifices to pay off their debt to the Deity, and so be free to go on with their old devices (as in Jeremiah 7:15). This seems the best view of the difficult words which follow, but it implies a correction of the certainly ungrammatical rendering of the Authorized Version - seeing she hath wrought lewdness - into to work the wicked device. But here begins the most obscure part of the verse. With many cannot be right; for \"with\" has nothing corresponding to it in the Hebrew; the word in the original simply means \"the many,\" and as it is immediately followed by a noun in the singular with \"and,\" and a verb in the plural, it is plain that it must (if correctly read) be part of the subject of the latter. The Septuagint, however, has a different reading, which may very well be correct, and out of which the received Hebrew reading may easily have grown - \"Can vows and holy [i.e. hallowed] flesh remove from thee thy wickedness [or perhaps, 'thy calamity']?\" The connection thus becomes easy. \"Vows and holy flesh\" (i.e. the flesh of sacrifices, Haggai 2:12), naturally go together; the only other possible way of taking the passage (assuming the correctness of the 'received text) - \" the great ones and the holy flesh shall pass away from thee\" - is obviously inadmissible. \"Vows and sacrifices,\" however, precisely express the true association of ideas. A man made a vow, and he generally paid it in the form of a sacrifice. But, inquires Jehovah, \"Can such vows and such Victims please God, and expiate thy wickedness [or, 'avert thy calamity']? Then thou mightest rejoice.\" The latter words are not, indeed, more exact than those of the Authorized Version, but are in accordance with grammar, and suit the preceding question. It is not certain, however, that the text is right here; the Septuagint has η} τούτοις διαφεύξῃ. (Notice that Keil, conservative to a fault in matters affecting the received text, agrees with the above correction, which is also adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A green olive tree. The olive tree is \"one of the most thriving, hardy, and productive trees in the East\" (it was the first tree elected king in the parable, Judges 9:8), and with its \"foliage of a deep, perennial green,\" furnishes a striking symbol of healthful beauty. A psalmist, speaking in the character of the typical righteous man, compares himself to a \"green olive tree in the house of God' (Psalm 52:8). The word rendered \"green \"is one of those which are the despair of translators (see on Jeremiah 2:20). It gives a picture in itself. We seem to see a flourishing, sappy tree, with abundance of pliant, gracefully moving, perennially green branches. With the noise of a great tumult. Either the tumult of the melee of battle is meant (the same uncommon word is used with such a reference in Ezekiel 1:24) or the crashing of thunder. \"With a rushing mighty sound\" would be a more forcible rendering. (For the concluding figure, comp. Ezekiel 31:12.) He hath kindled fire, etc. There is no occasion to explain this as merely the perfect of prophetic certitude. It was literally true that the fire of war had already devastated the fairest portion of the Holy Land. Israel (expressly referred to in Ver. 17) had already been carried into captivity, and Judah was, to the prophetic eye, as good as destroyed. Here, no doubt, that wonderful perfect of faith does come in.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The Lord of hosts, that planted thee; He who \"planted\" Israel (comp. Jeremiah 2:21) could also uproot it; and though, for the sake of his covenant with Abraham, he would not destroy it utterly, yet he could not but interpose as Judge to punish its manifold transgressions. Israel and Judah are mentioned together; for the prophets, so far as we know them from their works, did not recognize the separation of the two kingdoms. Against themselves; rather, for themselves; i.e. to please themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Here, as Naegelsbaeh puts it, begins the second stage of the \"conspiracy.\" Hath given me knowledge, etc.; rather, gave me knowledge, and I knew it. Then; i.e. when I was in utter unconsciousness. Jeremiah had no presentiment of the murderous purpose of his townsmen, till by some \"special providence\" it came to his knowledge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Like a lamb or an ox; rather, as a mild lamb (as one of the old translations has it), equivalent to quasi agaus mansuetus (Vulgate). Jeremiah says that he was as unsuspicious as a tame lamb which has grown up with its master's family (2 Samuel 12:3). The Arabs use the very same adjective in a slightly different form as an epithet of such tame lambs (Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 1:520-522, edit. 1663). It is impossible to help thinking of that \"Servant of Jehovah,\" of whom Jeremiah was a type, who is said, in prophetic vision, to have been \"brought as a lamb to the slaughter,\" and \"not to have opened his mouth \"(Isaiah 53:7). The tree with the fruit thereof; apparently a proverbial expression. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the rendering would be, the tree with its bread (b'lakhmo). Our translators appear to have thought that the transition from \"bread\" to \"fruit\" was as justifiable in Hebrew as it is in Arabic (in which 'uklu means properly \"food\" in general, but also \"date fruit\"). Fruit, however, was not such an important article of food with the Israelites as with the Arabs; and we must either, with Hitzig, suppose a letter to have intruded into the text, and render (from a corrected reading b'lekho), with its sap (comp. Deuteronomy 34:7, Hebrew), or else appeal to the etymology of lekhem (commonly \"bread\"), which is \"firm, consistent,\" and render, the tree with its pith (Hence lahmu in Arabic means \"flesh,\" and luhmatu, \"a woof\"). It is no credit to St. Jerome that he followed the absurd version of the Septuagint, \"Let us put wood into his bread.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - (Parallel passage, Jeremiah 20:12.) Unto thee have I revealed my cause. This is the literal rendering, but a comparison of Psalm 22:8 and Proverbs 16:3, suggests that the In meaning is Upon thee have I rolled my cause.\" This expression is certainly not only more forcible, but more appropriate than the other. Jeremiah's cause was not a secret which needed to be \"revealed\" to Jehovah, but a burden too heavy for so finely strung a nature to bear alone. Grammatically, the preferred meaning is quite justifiable, though less obvious, as there are other instances of an interchange of meanings between two classes of verbs (see on Jeremiah 33:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Prophesy not, etc. The men of Anathoth tried first of all to effect their object by threatening. In the name of the Lord should be rather, by the name, etc. The phrase is exactly parallel to Psalm 55:1, \"Save me, O God, by thy Name, and judge me by thy strength.\" The Name of God is equivalent to his revealed presence or personality. Baal's prophets prophesied \"by Baal\" (Jeremiah 2:8), i.e. by an impulse thought to proceed from Baal; Jehovah's by the consciousness of his revealed presence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Their sons and their daughters, etc. The lot of the weaker sex and of the male children under the military age is contrasted with that of the young warriors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Even the year, etc.; better, in the year of their visitation (or, punishment), taking the accusative as that of time.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRighteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Painfully exercised by the mysteries of the Divine government, the prophet opens his grief to Jehovah. Righteous art thou, etc.; rather, Righteous wouldest thou be, O Jehovah, if I should plead with thee; i.e. if I were to bring a charge against thee, I should be unable to convict thee of injustice (comp. Psalm 51:4; Job 9:2). The prophet, however, cannot refrain from laying before Jehovah a point which seems to him irreconcilable with the Divine righteousness. The rendering, indeed, must be modified. Let me talk with thee of thy judgments should rather be, yet will I debate questions of right with thee. The questions remind us of those of Job in Job 21, 24. Thus to have been the recipient of special Divine revelations, and to be in close communion with God, gives no security against the occasional ingress of doubting thoughts and spiritual distress. Wherefore are all they happy, etc.? rather, secure. The statement must be qualified by what follows. In the general calamity the wicked still fare the best.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Far from their reins; i.e. from their heart (the seat of strong impulses and desires); comp. Psalm 16:7; Psalm 26:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Hast seen me, and tried; rather, seest me, and triest. Pull them out. Perhaps this is correct, and there is an allusion to the figure of the plant in Ver. 2. But the verb need mean no more than \"separate\" (comp. Jeremiah 6:29). Prepare them; literally, consecrate them, as victims for the sacrifice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - How long, etc.? The verse is decided rather differently by the Hebrew accents. The question should end at wither, and the following words run on. Every field should be the whole field (i.e. open country). The connection has caused some difficulty. But drought is constantly described as a judgment (Jeremiah 3:3; Jeremiah 5:24, 25; Jeremiah 14:2-7; Jeremiah 23:10), and it is a prophetic doctrine that the lower animals suffer for the fault of man. Because they said; rather, because they say. The speakers are the ungodly. The subject of the following verb is uncertain. Some think it is God; but when God is said to \"see\" (i.e. take notice of) anything, it is always something actually existing. The subject must, therefore, be the prophet, of whom the ungodly scoffingly declare, He shall not see our last end, because his predictions are mere delusions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Jeremiah's impatience corrected. The expressions are evidently proverbial. The opposition to the prophet will reach a still higher pitch; and if he is so soon discouraged, how will he bear his impending trials? And if in the land of peace, etc.? a second figure, the translation of which needs amending. If (only) in a land of peace thou art confident, how wilt thou do in the pride of Jordan? The \"pride of Jordan\" means the thickets on its banks, which were notorious as the haunts of lions (Jeremiah 49:19; Jeremiah 50:44; Zechariah 11:3). \" Lions' bones have been found by Dr. Roth in the gravel of the Jordan. Lions are seldom or never found now west of the Euphrates, although they occasionally cross the river\" (Revelation W. Houghton, 'Bible Educator,' 1:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - An example of the \"treachery\" referred to in Ver. 1; a conspiracy against Jeremiah in his own family. Have called a multitude after thee; rather, have called aloud after thee, as one raises a hue and cry after a thief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-17. - A separate prophecy. The key to it is in 2 Kings 24:1, 2, where it is related that, after Jehoiakim's rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, \"Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it.\" The prophecy falls into two strophes or sections, Vers. 7-13 and Vers. 14-17. In the first we have a complaint of the desolation produced by the guerilla warfare; in the second, a prediction of the captivity of the hostile peoples, not, however, without a prospect of their return home and conversion to Jehovah. It is evident enough that this passage stands in no connection with what precedes. The whole tone is that of a description of present scenes and not of the future. Sometimes, no doubt, a prophet, in the confidence of faith, represents the future as though it were already past; but there is always something in the context to determine the reference and prevent ambiguity. Here, however, there is nothing to indicate that the description relates to the future; and it is followed by a prediction which presupposes that the preceding passage refers to the literal past. Verse 7. - I have forsaken mine house. The \"house\" is here not the temple, but the people of Israel, as the parallel clause shows (see Hosea 8:1, and setup. Hebrews 3:6; 1 Timothy 3:15). Jehovah, not the prophet, is evidently the speaker. I have left; rather, I have east away. Into the hand of her enemies. The Hebrew is more expressive: \"Into the palm of the hand.\" Bonomi ('Nineveh and her Palaces,' p. 191) has an engraving from the monuments of guests at a banquet, holding their drinking-vessels in the deeply hollowed palm of their hand. So here the people of Israel, in her weak, fainting state, needs only to be held in the quiet pressure of the palm of the hand. The remark and the illustration are due to Dr. Payne Smith.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The reason why Jehovah has given up his people. Israel (or, more strictly, Judah) has proceeded to open hostility against his God. He is unto me - or rather, has become unto me - as a lion in the forest; a familiar circumstance (comp. on Ver. 5 and Jeremiah 4:7). Therefore have I hated it. \"To hate\" is a strong expression for the withdrawal of love, shown by the giving up of Israel into the power of his enemies, as Malachi 1:3 (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The first part of this verse is mistranslated. Instead of Mine heritage is unto me, etc., it should be, Is mine heritage unto me (i.e. to my sorrow, a dativus ethics) a colored bird of prey? Are birds of prey round about her? The passage is difficult, but the following seems the most plausible explanation: - Jehovah is represented as surprised to see his chosen people a prey to the heathen (a strongly anthropomorphic description, as if Jehovah had not anticipated that his \"giving up\" his people would have such sad results). It seems to him (adopting human modes of speech) as if Israel were \"a colored bird of prey,\" the bright plumage of which excites the animosity of its less brilliant comrades, who gather round it and pull it to pieces. It is an allusion to the phenomenon, well-known to the ancients (Tacit., 'Ann.' 6:28; Suet., 'Caes.,' 81; Plin.,' Hist. Nat.,' 10:19), of birds gathering round and attacking a strange-looking bird appearing in their midst. The prophet might have simply said \"a bird;\" why does he say \"a bird of prey ('ayit)\"? Probably because he has just described the hostile attitude of Israel towards Jehovah under the figure of a lion. Some particular, rare kind of vulture seems to be intended. Sennacherib apparently uses a cognate word ('it) for the vulture ('Taylor Cylinder,' 3. 68). Bochart and Gesenius, following the Septuagint, think \"hyena,\" and not \"bird of prey,\" is the right rendering in the first clause; but Gesenius does not offer any other passage for the meaning bestia rapax. Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field. There is a parallel passage in Isaiah 56:9, where, as here, the \"beasts of the field (i.e. the wild beasts of the open country) are the heathen powers employed as God's instruments for chastising Israel (comp. also Ezekiel 34:5, where the same figure occurs). \"The prophet adopts the strongest way of expressing that Israel, utterly bereft of his natural defenders, lies at the mercy of the great heathen empire\" (note on Isaiah 56:9). Come to devour; rather, bring them to devour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Another simpler and more natural image, expressing the same idea, as these in Ver. 9. The favorite way of representing Jehovah's relation to his people is that of a vine-proprietor to his vineyard (see on Jeremiah 2:21). How would a vineyard be ruined if a band of shepherds were to drive their flocks among the tender vine-shoots! The many pastors (or, shepherds) are clearly Nebuchadnezzar and his generals (comp. Jeremiah 6:3). My pleasant portion. Jehovah is the \"portion\" of his people; his people and its land are the \"portion\" of Jehovah (see on Jeremiah 10:16). The epithet \"pleasant\" expresses the emotion of the surprised speaker.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Layeth it to heart; rather, laid it to heart. Inconsiderateness is repeatedly spoken of as an aggravation of the moral sickness of Israel (Isaiah 42:25; Isaiah 57:1, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Upon an high places thresh the wilderness; rather, upon all bare heights in the wilderness (see on Jeremiah 3:2). Hardly with a reference to their pollution by idolatry; the mention of \"the wilderness\" (or pasture-country) suggests that it is merely a feature in the impoverishment of the country (a contrast to Isaiah 49:9). The sword of the Lord shall devour; rather, the Lord hath a sword which devoureth. It is the heavenly sword (Isaiah 34:5), the symbol of Divine vengeance (see below on Jeremiah 46:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A description in proverbial language of the absence of \"peace\" (literally, soundness, i.e. prosperity, security), from which \"all flesh\" in Judah at this time shall suffer. The trouble of sowing has been in vain, for they have reaped thorns (so we must render grammatically, and not shall reap, and in the next clause shall not profit ought to be have not profited). And they shall be ashamed of your revenues; rather, be ashamed then of your produce; but it is more natural to emend the pronominal suffix, and render, and are ashamed of their produce (the Authorized Version seems to have very nearly taken this easy step). It is, of course, the produce of husbandry which is referred to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Here occurs a transition. The prophet comes forward with a denunciation in the name of Jehovah. All mine evil neighbors; the hostile, peoples, mentioned, in 2 Kings 24. My neighbors, because Jehovah \"dwelleth in Zion.\" Pluck them out of their land; viz. by deportation into a foreign land. Judah and the neighboring nations shall share the same fate. This is indicated by the use of the same verb \"to pluck out\" in the next clause with reference to Judah (comp. 1 Kings 14:15, Hebrew). In the case of Judah, however, to be \"plucked out\" is a mercy as well as a judgment, considering who they are \"out of\" whose \"midst\" the Jews are \"plucked.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I will return, and have compassion. The rendering is too Hebraistic; the sense is simply, I will again have compassion. The prophets offer no partial or \"nationalistic\" view; of the mercy of God (comp. on Jeremiah 48:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Israel has been converted and restored, and if the other nations follow his example and swear by my name, i.e. adopt the religion of Jehovah (comp. Isaiah 19:18), they shall be rewarded by being suffered to dwell safely in Israel's midst. Observe the contrast with Ver. 14. Before, Israel had dwelt amidst them to his own detriment; now they shall dwell amidst Israel to their profit.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-11. - The entire people of the Jews is like a good-for-nothing apron. Verse 1. - A linen girdle; rather, a linen apron. \"Girdle\" is one of the meanings of the Hebrew ('ezor), but is here unsuitable. As Ver. 11 shows, it is an inner garment that is meant, one that \"cleaveth to the loins of a man\" (in fact, περίζωμα of the Septuagint, the lumbare of the Vulgate). The corresponding Arabic word, 'izar, has, according to Lane, the meaning of \"waist-wrapper.' Israel was to Jehovah in as close a relation spiritually as that in which the inner garment referred to is to him who wears it materially. There is an Arabic proverb which well illustrates this: \"He is to me in place of an 'izar\" (Freytag, 'Studium der Arab. Spraohe,' p. 298). \"A linen apron\" may perhaps be specified, because linen was the material of the priestly dress (Leviticus 16:4), and Israel was to be spiritually\" a kingdom of priests.\" But this is not absolutely necessary. The common man used linen in his dress as well as the priest; the only difference between them was that the priest was confined to linen garments. But an ,' apron\" would in any case naturally be made of linen. Linen; literally, flax (a product of Judah, Hosea 2:5). Put it not in water. The object of the prohibition is well stated by St. Jerome. It was at once to symbolize the character of the people of Israel, stiff and impure, like unwashed linen, and to suggest the fate in store for it (Ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-6. - After Jeremiah has worn the apron for some time, he is directed to take it to P'rath, and hide it there in a cleft (not \"hole\") of the rock. A long interval elapses, and he is commanded to make a second journey to the same place, and fetch away the apron. What does this P'rath mean? It is by no means easy to decide. Hardly \"the Euphrates,\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because the common prefix, \"the river,\" is wanting, though in so extraordinary a narrative it was peculiarly needed;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) because of the length of the journey to Babylonia, which has ex hyp. to be made twice; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) because the Euphrates is not a rocky river. Ewald suggested that \"some wet place near Jerusalem\" probably had the name of P'rath, and indicates a valley and spring called Forah, about six English miles north-east of Jerusalem. Mr. Birch appears to have hit independently on the same spot, which he identifies with the Parah of Joshua 18:23, about three miles north-east of Anatbeth, and describes as a picturesque gorge between savage rocks, with a copious stream (Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, October, 1880, p. 236). This combination, however, involves an emendation of the text (P'rath into Parah) - logically it involves this, as Mr. Birch has seen; Ewald's comparison of the Arabic furat, sweet water, seems inconsistent with his reference to Parah - for which there does not seem to be sufficient necessity; and it is better to adopt the view of the great old French Protestant scholar, Bochart, that P'rath is a shortened form of Ephrath, i.e. at once Bethlehem and the district in which Bethlehem lay (see 1 Chronicles 2:50; 1 Chronicles 4:4; and perhaps Psalm 132:6). It need hardly be said that the limestone hills of this region afforded abundance of secluded rocks. There may, of course, be at the same time an allusion to the ordinary meaning of P'rath, viz. Euphrates, on the analogy of the allusion in Isaiah 27:12. Those who hold the view here rejected, that P'rath is equivalent to the Euphrates, sometimes suppose that the narrative is a parable or symbolical fiction, such as Luther, Calvin, and others find in Hosea 1, 3, the thing signified being in this case the carrying captive of the people to Babylon; and this seems the best way of making this interpretation plausible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - After many days.

Could there be a greater humiliation for Judah and Jerusalem than to be compared to a rotting linen apron? The hard things said of this evil people in Ver. 10 must of course be understood with the limitations indicated in the note on Jeremiah 9:15, 16. Imagination should (as usual) be stubbornness. The explanation in Ver. 11 is a strong argument for the rendering \"apron\" (see above, on Ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - Here another symbol is introduced - a symbolic phrase rather than a symbolic action. The first symbol referred to the people as a whole; the second represents the fate of the individual members of the people. The words, Thus saith the lord God of Israel, are omitted in the Septuagint, and certainly the form of the following phrase seems hardly worthy of so solemn an introduction. Every bottle. It is an earthenware bottle, or pitcher, which seems from Ver. 13 to be meant (comp. Isaiah 30:14), though the Septuagint renders here ἀσκός. The kings that sit upon David's throne; rather, that sit for David upon his throne; i.e. as David's heirs and successors. The plural \"kings\" is to include all the kings who reigned during the final period of impending ruin. With drunkenness. The effect of the \"wine-cup of [the Divine] fury\" (Jeremiah 25:15). Dash them one against another. This is merely the development of the figure of the pitchers; not a prediction of civil war. The pitchers, when cast down, must of course fall together into pieces.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-19. - An admonition to seize upon the only means of escape.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Give glory, etc. Let your tribute to your King be that of humble submission to his will. The precise application of the phrase must be derived from the context (comp. Joshua 7:19; Malachi 2:2). Upon the dark mountains; rather, upon mountains of twilight. A \"mountain\" is an image of a great obstacle (Zechariah 4:7; Matthew 21:21). As Judah is walking along, the hitherto even tenor of his way gives place to huge mountains wrapped in an impenetrable dusk, over which he will stumble and fall if he does not repent in time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Should all admonitions be in vain, Jeremiah will return (like Samuel, 1 Samuel 15:35) and give vent to his sorrowful emotion. The Lord's flock. Jehovah is likened to a shepherd (comp. Zechariah 10:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The extent of the calamity shown in individual instances. For the fulfillment, see 2 Kings 24:15. After a reign of three months, the young prince and his mother were carried to Babylon. And to the queen; rather, and to the queen-mother (literally, the mistress). It will be noticed that, except in two cases, the names of the mothers of the reigning kings of Judah are scrupulously mentioned in the Books of Kings. This and the title of \"mistress\" are indications of the high rank they enjoyed in the social system. In the case of Asa, we are told that he removed his mother, Maachah, from her position as \"mistress,\" or queen-mother, on account of her idolatry (1 Kings 15:13). The political value of the station is strikingly shown by the ease with which Athaliah, as queen-mother, usurped the supreme authority (2 Kings 11.). From an historical point of view, the \"queen-mother\" of the Jews is a most interesting personage; she is a relic of the primitive age in which relationship was reckoned with regard to the mother (so with the Accadians, Etruseans, Finns, etc.). It should be added, however, that once (viz. 1 Kings 11:19) the same title, \"mistress,\" is applied to the queen-consort. Humble yourselves, sit down; rather, sit down in abase-sent; i.e. take the station suitable for your abased circumstances (comp. Isaiah 47:1). Your principalities; rather, your head. ornaments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The rendering of the Authorized Version is substantially right, as the events referred to are obviously future. The tense, however, in the Hebrew, is the perfect - viz. that of prophetic certitude. Jeremiah sees it all in prophetic vision, as if it were actually taking place. The cities of the south; i.e. of the dry, southern country of Judah, called the Negeb - shall be [are] shut up - i.e. blocked up with ruins (as Isaiah 24:10) - and none shall open them (openeth them), because all Judah will have been carried captive. (For fulfillment, see Jeremiah 34:7.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - The captivity being still (in spite of the perfect tense) a thing of the future, the prophet can seek to awaken the conscience of the careless under-shepherd by showing how serf-caused is his (or rather her) punishment. Verse 20. - Lift up your eyes. The verb is fern. sing., the pronoun (in suffix form) masc. plu, - a clear indication that the person addressed is a collective. Probably the \"daughter of Zion\" is intended, which, in a certain sense, might be called the \"shepherd\" or leader of the rest of the nation. From the north. Again this horror of the north as the source of calamity (see on Jeremiah 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - What wilt thou say, etc.? The rendering of the verse is uncertain, though the Authorized Version undoubtedly requires correction. The alternatives are, What wilt thou say when he shall appoint over thee (but thou thyself hast trained them against thee) familiar friends as thy head? and, What wilt thou say when he shall appoint over thee those whom thou hast taught thy familiar friends as thy head? The rendering \"familiar friends\" is justified by Psalm 55:13; Proverbs 16:28; Proverbs 17:9; Micah 7:5. The \"captains\" of Authorized Version, or rather \"tribal chiefs,\" is unsuitable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Thy heels made bare; rather, treated with violence. The fate held out to the daughter of Zion (trained to walk about with \"tinkling ornaments,\" Isaiah 3:18) is to plod wearily along with bare feet (comp. Isaiah 47:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - As the stubble. \"The word means not what we call stubble, but the broken straw which had to be separated from the wheat after the corn had been trampled out by the oxen. Sometimes it was burnt as useless; at other times left to be blown away by the wind coming from the desert, on which see Jeremiah 4:11; Job 1:19\" (Payne Smith).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The portion of thy measures; i.e. thy measured portion. But it is probably safer to render, the portion of thy garment, the upper garment being used instead of a bag to hold anything (comp. Ruth 3:15; 2 Kings 4:39). In falsehood; i.e. in false gods (Jeremiah 16:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Therefore will I, etc. But the Hebrew is much more forcible, \"And I also,\" etc., implying, as Calvin remarks (comp. Proverbs 1:26), a certain retaliation. Upon thy face; an allusion to Nahum 3:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah13:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I have seen, etc. The Hebrew is again more forcible than the English. It runs, \"Thine adulteries and thy neighings,\" etc. l (this is an exclamation as it were; then more reflectively),\" I have seen thine abominations.\" Neighings; i.e. passionate craving for illegitimate objects of worship (comp. Jeremiah 2:24, 25; Jeremiah 5:8). In the fields. The Hebrew has the singular. The \"field,\" as usual, means the open country. Wilt thou not, etc.? rather, How long ere thou be made clean? In Ver. 23 the prophet had vehemently declared his people to be incorrigible. But, like the tender Hoses, he cannot continue to hold such gloomy thoughts; surely Israel, God's people, must eventually be \"made clean!\" But this can only be as the result of judicial affliction, and these afflictions will be no slight or transient ones.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The dearth; rather, the drought, or, more literally, the droughts, the plural being used to indicate the length of time the drought lasted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The tenses in the following description should be perfects and presents; the Authorized Version, by its inconsistency, destroys the unity of the picture. The gates thereof; i.e. the people assembled there. They are black unto the ground. \"To be black,\" in Hebrew, is \"to be dressed in mourning\" (so e.g., Psalm 35:14, \"I bowed down in black\"). Here we must understand the same verb which is expressed in the psalm, \"They bowed down in mourning attire to the ground.\" \"Black,\" however, is not to be taken literally; it means rather \"squalid, unwashed\" (of garments).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Their nobles - i.e. the upper classes of Judah and Jerusalem - have sent their little ones; rather, their mean ones; i.e. their servants, or perhaps (as Naegelsbach and Payne Smith) simply, \"the common people;\" it was not a matter concerning the rich alone. To the pits; i.e. to the cisterns. Covered their heads; a sign of the deepest mourning (2 Samuel 15:30; 2 Samuel 19:4; Esther 6:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The ground is chapt. Perhaps: but it is more obvious to render, is dismayed, according to the usual meaning of the word. Words which properly belong to human beings are often, by a \"poetic fallacy,\" applied to inanimate objects (as in Ver. 2). In the earth; rather, in the land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Even the animals starve.

The hind, contrary to that intense natural affection for which she was famous among the ancients, abandons her young.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The wild asses... in the high places; rather, on the bare heights. \"The wild asses,\" says a traveler cited by Rosenmüller,\" are especially fond of treeless mountains.\" Like dragons; render rather, like jackals (as Jeremiah 9:11; 10:22). The allusion is to the way jackals hold their head as they howl. We are told that even the keen eyes of the wild asses fail, because there was [is] no grass; rather, herbage. They grow dim first with seeking it so long in vain, and then from lack of nourishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The intercession of Jeremiah begins. Do thou it; a pregnant expression, equivalent to \"act gloriously\" (as Psalm 22:31; Isaiah 44:23); For thy name's sake. Jehovah s\" Name pledges him to be merciful to his people, and not to make a full end of them, even when they have offended (comp.\" Our Redeemer was thy name from of old\" Isaiah 63:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - How pathetic a supplication! Jehovah will surely not be as a stranger in the land - the strangers, or\" sojourners,\" like the μέτοικοι, enjoyed no civic rights, and consequently had no interest in the highest concerns of the state, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside - or perhaps, pitcketh his tent; for the traveler in Palestine doubtless carried his tent with him then as now - to tarry for a night. With the latter figure compare the beautiful comparison of the hope of the ungodly to \"the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day\" (Wisd. 5:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As a man astonished; rather (comparing the Arabic dahama), as one struck dumb. But Dr. Payne Smith, with much reason, is more than half inclined to follow the Septuagint reading, equivalent to \"as one in a deep sleep.\" Leave us not; literally, lay us not down; as if a burden of which the bearer is tired.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-16. - The answer of Jehovah. Verse 10. - Thus have they loved to wander, ... therefore the Lord doth not accept them; i.e. with such pertinacity have they been set upon \"wandering\" (roving lawlessly about), that the Lord hath no more pleasure in them. \"Therefore,\" is, literally, and. \"Thus,\" or \"so,\" is used in the same sense as in 1 Kings 10:12, which runs literally, \"... there came not so [abundantly] among timber.\" The particle of comparison has given much occupation to the commentators (see Payne Smith's note), but the above view is at once simple and suitable to the context; for Jeremiah has already admitted that \"our backslidings are multiplied\" (Ver. 7). The Lord doth not, etc. (to the end of the verse), is quoted verbatim from Hosea 8:13. Jeremiah puts conspicuous honor on the older inspired writers; he has no craving for originality. Nearly all has been said already; what he has to do is chiefly to adapt and to apply, He will now remember, etc. The emphasis is on \"now\" Nothing is more remarkable in the prophets than the stress laid on the unerring justness of the time chosen for Divine interpositions. When the iniquity is fully ripe, it as it were attracts the punishment, which till then is laid up in store (comp. Genesis 15:16; Isaiah 18:5; Isaiah 33:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Pray not for this people. So in Jeremiah 7:16 (on which see note); Jeremiah 11:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Their cry. The word is very forcible; it is the shriek in which an unsophisticated man gives vent to his pain and grief. An oblation. It is the vegetable offering (Authorized Version, \"meat offering;\" Luther, \"speisopfer\") which is referred to in the so-called minkhah (literally, gift). Though sometimes offered separately, it regularly accompanied a burnt offering. I will not accept them. Dr. Payne Smith tries to soften the rejection of these worshippers by the remark that \"there is a time when the most genuine repentance avails nothing to avert the temporal consequences of sin.\" But the analogy of other similar passages (e.g. Isaiah 1:15) warrants the view of Keil that the ground of the rejection of the worship is its heartless formalism and insincerity, which was equally a bar to Jehovah's favor and the prophet's intercession.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - \"Pleading with Providence, the good prophet lays the blame on ill teaching, but the stern answer (Ver. 14), admitting the plea as true, rejects it as inadequate (Ver. 14), and denounces sorrows which (Vers. 17-22) the prophet passionately deprecates\" (Rowland Williams). Ah, Lord God! rather, Alas! O Lord Jehovah (see on Jeremiah 1:6). The prophets say unto them. The greater part of the prophetic order had not kept pace with its more spiritual members (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.). They still traded on those natural gifts of divination (Micah 3:6) which were, no doubt, where genuine, of Divine origin, but which, even then, needed to be supplemented and controlled by a special impulse from the Spirit of holiness. Jeremiah, however, declares, on the authority of a revelation, that these prophets did not divine by any God-given faculty, but \"the deceit of their own heart\" (Ver. 14). The Deuteronomic Torah, discovered after a period of concealment at the outset of Jeremiah's ministry, energetically forbids the practice of the art of divination (Deuteronomy 18:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A thing of naught. The word, however, is collective, and means all the various futile means adopted for prying into the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will pour their wickedness; i.e. the fruits of their wickedness (comp. Jeremiah 2:19, \"Thine own wickedness shall correct thee\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-21. - The prophet's grief, and second intercession. Verse 17. - Therefore thou shalt say, etc. There is something strange and contrary to verisimilitude in the prefixing of this formula, not to a Divine revelation, but to a mere expression of the pained human feelings of the prophet. It is possible that the editor of Jeremiah's prophecies thought the paragraph which begins here needed something to link it with the preceding passage, and selected his formula rather unsuitably. Let mine eyes run down, etc. (comp. Jeremiah 13:27). Jeremiah's tender compassion shows itself in his choice of the expression, the virgin daughter of my people, just as we feel an added bitterness in the premature death of a cherished maiden.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A picture of the state of things after the capture of Jerusalem: the slain without, the famine-stricken within. The latter are described allusively as \"sicknesses of famine\" (so literally). As a peculiarly striking evidence of the downfall of greatness, it is added that even prophet and priest have to go about into a land that they know not. The verb used here can obviously not have its ordinary sense of going about for purposes of traffic. Aramaic usage suggests, however, a suitable meaning; what the prophet sketches before us is a company of these ex-grandees \"begging their way\" into an unknown land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - We looked for peace, etc.; a repetition of Jeremiah 8:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers. There is a mysterious connection between the sin of the past and of the present. So in another prophet we read, \"Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together [will I requite].\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The throne of thy glory; i.e. the temple (Jeremiah 17:12; Ezekiel 43:7), or Jerusalem (Jeremiah 3:17). It is the same conception where Jehovah is said to \"dwell between\" [or, 'sit upon'] \"the cherubim\" (Isaiah 37:16; Psalm 80:1; Psalm 99:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - None of the vanities, or false gods (Jeremiah 3:17), of the heathen can deliver us in this our strait (want of rain). \"Rainmakers\" is still a common name of soothsayers among savage nations. Thou alone art God, and our God; or, in Jeremiah's phrase (not, Art not thou he, etc.? but) Art thou not Jehovah our God? and the ground of the appeal follows, Jehovah is the Maker of all these things; i.e. all the heavenly phenomena, especially the clouds and the rain.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - Second rejection of Jeremiah's intercession; awfulness of the impending judgment. Verse 1. - Though Moses and Samuel, etc. It is a mere supposition which is here made; there is no allusion to any popular view of the intercession of saints (see my note on Isaiah 63:16). If even a Moses or a Samuel would intercede in vain, the case of the Judahites must indeed be desperate. For these were the nearest of all the prophets to Jehovah, and repeatedly prayed their people out of grievous calamity (comp. Psalm 99:6). Jeremiah had already sought to intercede for his people (see on Jeremiah 7:16). Cast them out of my sight; rather, Dismiss them from my presence. The people are represented as praying or sacrificing in the fore courts of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Such as are for death, etc.; a sternly ironical answer. Death, sword, famine, captivity, lie in wait for them in every possible road. \"Death\" here means \"pestilence\" (comp. \"the black death\" in the Middle Ages), as in Jeremiah 18:21; Job 27:15. Similar combinations of evils occur in Jeremiah 43:11; Ezekiel 14:21; Ezekiel 33:27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Appoint; i.e. give full power to them as my vicegerents (Jeremiah 1:10). Four kinds; literally, families; i.e. kinds of things. The first-mentioned has reference to the living; the remaining ones to the unburied corpses (Jeremiah 14:16; Jeremiah 19:7; Jeremiah 34:20). To tear; rather, to drag along.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Cause them to be removed into; rather, make them a shuddering unto.

(the imperfect in its potential sense). The horror which will seize upon the spectators will effectually preclude pity. Who shall go aside? As one turns aside to call at a house.

I am weary with repenting; i.e. with recalling my (conditional) sentence of punishment (see on Jeremiah 18:1-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The gates of the land. The phrase might mean either the cities in general (comp. Micah 5:5; Isaiah 3:26) or the fortresses commanding the entrance into the land (comp. Nahum 3:13). The context decides in favor of the latter view. Ewald's explanation, \"borders of the earth\" (i.e. the most distant countries), seems less natural. I will bereave them, etc. The proper object of the verb is my people (personified as a mother). The population are to fall in war (comp. the same figure in Ezekiel 5:17). The tense is the perfect of prophetic certitude; literally, I have bereaved, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - To me; i.e. at my bidding. It is the dative of cause. Against the mother of the young men; rather, upon... young man. The widow has lost her husband, the mother her son, so that no human power can repel the barbarous foe. The word rendered \"young man\" is specially used for \"young warriors,\" e.g., Jeremiah 18:21; 49:26; 51:3. Others following Rashi, take \"mother\" in the sense of \"metropolis,\" or \"chief city\" (see Authorized Version, margin), in which case \"young man\" must be connected with the participle rendered \"a spoiler;\" but though the word has this sense in 2 Samuel 20:19, it is there coupled with \"city,\" so that no doubt can exist. Hero the prophet would certainly not have used the word in so unusual a sense without giving some guide to his meaning. The rendering adopted above has the support of Ewald, Hitzig, and Dr. Payne Smith. At noonday; at the most unlooked-for moment (see on Jeremiah 6:4). I have caused him, etc.; rather, I have caused pangs and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - That hath borne seven; a proverbial expression (comp. 1 Samuel 2:5; Ruth 4:15). Her sun is gone down, etc. The figure is that of an eclipse (comp. Amos 9:9). She hath been ashamed, etc.; rather, she ashamed, etc. Ewald supposes the sun, which is sometimes feminine in Hebrew, to be the subject (comp. Isaiah 24:23); but the view of the Authorized Version is more probable. The shame of childlessness is repeatedly referred to (comp. Jeremiah 1:12; Isaiah 54:4; Genesis 16:4; Genesis 30:1, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-21. - These verses come in very unexpectedly, and are certainly not to be regarded as a continuation of the preceding discourse. They describe some deeply pathetic moment of the prophet's inner life, and in all probability belong to a later period of the history of Judah. At any rate, the appreciation of the next chapter will be facilitated by reading it in close connection with Ver. 9 of the present chapter. But the section before us is too impressive to be east adrift without an attempt to find a place for it in the life of the prophet. The attempt has been made with some plausibility by a Jewish scholar, Dr. Gratz, who considers the background of these verses to be the sojourn of Jeremiah at Ramah, referred to in Jeremiah 40:1, and groups them, therefore, with another prophecy (Jeremiah 31:15-17), in which Ramah is mentioned by name as the temporary abode of the Jewish captives. We are told in Jeremiah 40:4, 5, that Jeremiah had the choice given him of either going to Babylon with the exiles, or dwelling with the Jews who were allowed to remain under Gedaliah the governor. He chose, as the narrative in Jeremiah 40. tells us, to stay with Gedaliah; but the narrative could not, in accordance with the reserve which characterizes the inspired writers, reveal the state of mind in which this difficult choice was made. This omission is supplied in the paragraph before us. Jeremiah, with that lyric tendency peculiar to him among the prophets, gives a vent to his emotion in these impassioned verses. He tells his friends that the resolution to go to Gedaliah may cost him a severe struggle. He longs for rest, and in Babylon he would have more chance of a quiet life than among the turbulent Jews at home. But he has looked up to God for guidance, and, however painful to the flesh, God's will must be obeyed. He gives us the substance of the revelation which he received. The Divine counselor points out that he has already interposed in the most striking manner for Jeremiah, and declares that if he will devote himself to the Jews under Gedaliah, a new and fruitful field will be open to him, in which, moreover, by Divine appointment, no harm can happen to him. Whether this is really the background of the paragraph must remain uncertain. In a case of this kind, we are obliged to call in the help of the imagination, if the words of the prophet are to be realized with any degree of vividness. There are some great difficulties in the text, and apparently one interpolation (Vers. 13, 14 being in all probability an incorrect copy of Jeremiah 17:3, 4). Verse 10. - Woe is me, my mother! This is one of those passages (comp. Introduction) which illustrate the sensitive and shrinking character of our prophet.NEWLINENEWLINE\"If his meek spirit erred, opprestNEWLINEThat God denied repose,NEWLINEWhat sin is ours, to whom Heaven's restNEWLINEIs pledged to heal earth's woes?\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Cardinal Newman, in 'Lyra Apostolica,' 88.). I have neither lent on usury, etc.; a speaking figure to men of the ancient world, to whom, as Dr. Payne Smith remarks, \"the relations between the money-lender and the debtor were the most fruitful source of lawsuits and quarrellings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord said. The prophets are usually so tenacious of the same formulae that even their slight deviations are noteworthy. \"The Lord said,\" for \"Thus saith the Lord,\" occurs only here and in Jeremiah 46:25 (where, however, the phrase has possibly been detached by mistake from the preceding verse). It shall be well with thy remnant; rather, I have loosed thee for (thy) good, or, thy loosing (shall be) for (thy good), according as we adopt the reading of the Hebrew text or that of the margin, which differs in form as slightly as it is possible to do. If we accept the historical setting proposed by Gratz for this paragraph, the reference will be to the \"loosing\" of Jeremiah from his chains mentioned in Jeremiah 40:4. The rendering given here is, however, only a probable one; it is in conformity with the Aramaic usage of the verb (the Targum uses it in this sense in Jeremiah 40:4), and is supported by its suitability to the context and, philologically, by the fact of the growing influence of Aramaic upon Hebrew. Gesenius, in his anxiety to keep close to the native use of the root, produces a rendering (of the Hebrew marginal reading) which does not suit the context, viz. \"I afflict thee for (thy) good.\" Jeremiah does not complain of being afflicted by God, but that all the world is against him; Ewald, comparing a different Aramaic verb to that appealed to above, renders, \"I strengthen thee,\" etc., which is adopted by Keil, but does not accord with the second half of the verse so well as the rendering adopted. The Authorized Version follows the Targum, the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Rashi, and Kimchi, assuming that sherith is contracted from sh'erith (as in 1 Chronicles 12:38), and that \"remnant\" is equivalent to \"remnant of life.\" But, though the sense is not unacceptable (comp. Vers. 20, 21), the form of expression is unnatural; we should have expected akharith'ka, \"thy latter end\" (comp. Job 8:7). I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well. This expression is as difficult as the preceding, and our rendering of it will depend entirely on our view of the context. If \"the enemy\" means the Chaldeans, the Authorized Version will be substantially correct. Rashi has already mentioned the view that the phrase alludes to Nebnzar-adan's respectful inquiry as to the wishes of Jeremiah in Jeremiah 40:2-5. In this case, the literal rendering is, I will cause the enemy to meet thee (as a friend); comp. Isaiah 47:3; Isaiah 64:4. But if \"the enemy\" means the Jews, then we must render, 1 grill cause the enemy to supplicate thee, and illustrate the phrase by the repeated applications of Zedekiah to the prophet (Jeremiah 21:1, 2; Jeremiah 37:3; Jeremiah 38:14), and the similar appeal of the \"captains of the forces,\" in Jeremiah 42:1-3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall iron break the northern iron and the steel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Shall iron break, etc.? Again an enigmatical saying. The rendering of the Authorized Version assumes that by the northern iron Jeremiah means the Babylonian empire. But the \"breaking\" of the Babylonian empire was not a subject which lay within the thoughts of the prophet. It was not the fate of Babylon, but his own troubled existence, and the possibility that his foes would ultimately succeed in crushing him, which disquieted this conscientious but timid spokesman of Jehovah. The Divine interlocutor has reminded him in the preceding verse of the mercy which has been already extended to him, and now recalls to his recollection the encouraging assurances given him in his inaugural vision (Jeremiah h 18, 19). Render, therefore, Can one break iron, northern iron, and bronze? The steel of the Authorized Version is evidently a slip. The Hebrew word is n'khosheth, which means sometimes (e.g. Jeremiah 6:28; Deuteronomy 8:9; Deuteronomy 33:25; Job 28:2) copper, but more commonly bronze, since \"copper unalloyed seems to have been but rarely used after its alloys with tin became known\" (Professor Maskelyne). \"Steel\" would have been more fitly introduced as the second of the three names of metals. \"Northern iron\" at once suggests the Chalybes, famous in antiquity for their skill in hardening iron, and, according to classical authors (e.g. Stephanus the geographer), the neighbors of the Tibareni, in the country adjoining the Euxine Sea, the Tibareni being, of course, the people of Tubal, whom Ezekiel mentions (Ezekiel 27:13) as trafficking in vessels of bronze. Any Jew, familiar with the wares of the bazaar, would at once appreciate the force of such a question as this. Even if iron could be broken, yet surely not steel nor bronze. Thus the verse simply reaffirms the original promises to Jeremiah, and prepares the way for Vers. 20, 21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - Thy substance, etc. These verses form an unlooked-for digression. The prophet has been in a state of profound melancholy, and the object of Jehovah is to rouse him from it. In Vers. 11, 12, the most encouraging assurances have been given him. Suddenly comes the overwhelming declaration contained in Vers. 13, 14. And when we look closely at these verses, two points strike us, which make it difficult to conceive that Jeremiah intended them to stand here. First, their contents are not at all adapted to Jeremiah, and clearly belong to the people of Judah; and next, they are repeated, with some variations, in Jeremiah 17:3, 4. It should also be observed that the Septuagint (which omits Jeremiah 17:1-4) only gives them here, which seems to indicate an early opinion that the passage only ought to occur once in the Book of Jeremiah, though the Septuagint translator failed to choose the right position for it. Without price; literally, not for a price. In the parallel passage there is another reading, \"thy high places,\" which forms part of the next clause. Hitzig and Graf suppose this to be the original reading, the Hebrew letters having been partly effaced and then misread, after which \"not\" was prefixed to make sense. However this may be, the present reading is unintelligible, if we compare Isaiah 52:3, where Jehovah declares that his people were sold for nothing, i.e. were given up entirely to the enemy, without any compensating advantage to Jehovah. And that for all thy sins, even, etc.; literally, and in all thy sins and in all thy borders. The text is certainly difficult. Externally a parallelism exists between the two halves of the clause, and one is therefore tempted to render literally. As this will not make sense, however, we are forced either to render as the Authorized Version, or to suppose that the text is not accurately preserved. The parallel passage has a different but not a more intelligible reading. Ewald omits \"and\" in both halves of the clause, which slightly diminishes the awkwardness. And I will make thee to pass, etc. The natural rendering of the Hebrew is, \"And I will make thine enemies to pass,\" etc., which clearly cannot be the prophet's meaning. The parallel passage (Jeremiah 17:4) has, \"And I will make thee to serve thine enemies,\" etc.; and so the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and many manuscripts here. For a fire is kindled in mine anger; a reminiscence of Deuteronomy 32:22, suggesting that the judgment described in the Song of Moses is about to fall upon Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - O Lord, thou knowest, etc. The prophet renews his complaints. God's omniscience is the thought which comforts him (comp. Jeremiah 17:6; Jeremiah 18:23; Psalm 69:19). But he desires some visible proof of God's continued care for his servant. Visit me, equivalent to \"be attentive to my wants \"-an anthropomorphic expression for the operation of Providence. Take me not away in thy long-suffering; i.e. \"suffer not my persecutors to destroy me through the long-suffering which thou displayest towards them.\" \"Take away,\" viz. my life (comp. Ezekiel 33:4, \"If the sword come and take him away\"). Rebuke; rather, reproach; cutup. Psalm 69:7 (Psalm 69. is in the style of Jeremiah, and, as Delitzsch remarks, suits his circumstances better than those of David).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thy words were found. Jeremiah here describes his first reception of a Divine revelation. Truth is like \"treasure hid in a field;\" he alone who seeks it with an unprejudiced mind can \"find\" it. But there are some things which no \"searching\" of the intellect can \"find\" (Job 11:7; Job 37:23; Ecclesiastes 3:11; Ecclesiastes 8:17); yet by a special revelation they may be \"found\" by God's \"spokesmen,\" or prophets. This is the train of thought which underlies Jeremiah's expression here. The \"words,\" or revelations, of Jehovah are regarded as having an objective existence in the ideal world of which God is the light, and as \"descending\" from thence (comp. Isaiah 9:8) into the consciousness of the prophet. So Ezekiel 3:1, \"Eat that thou findest.\" I did eat them; I assimilated them, as it were (comp. Ezekiel 2:8; Ezekiel 3:3). I am called by thy name; literally, thy name hath been (or, had been) called upon me; i.e. I have (or, had) been specially dedicated to thy service. The phrase is often used of Israel (see on Jeremiah 14:9), and, as here applied, intimates that a faithful prophet was, as it were, the embodied ideal of an Israelite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In the assembly of the mockers; rather, of the laughers. The serious thoughts arising out of his sacred office restrained him from taking part in the festive meetings to which his youth would naturally incline him (comp. on Jeremiah 16:2). Because of thy hand. The Hand of Jehovah is a figurative expression for the self-revealing and irresistible power of Jehovah; it is, therefore, equivalent to the Arm of Jehovah (Isaiah 53:1), but is used in preference with regard to the divinely ordained actions and words of the prophets. Thus we are told, in the accounts of Elijah and Elisha, that \"the hand of the Lord came upon\" them (1 Kings 18:46; 2 Kings 3:15). Such a phrase was probably at first descriptive of a completely passive ecstatic state, and was retained when ecstasies had become rare, with a somewhat laxer meaning. Isaiah uses a similar expression but once (Isaiah 8:11); Ezekiel, however, who appears to have been unusually rifled with the overpowering thought of the supernatural world, is constantly mentioning \"the hand of Jehovah\" (see Ezekiel 1:3; Ezekiel 3:22; Ezekiel 37:1; and especially Ezekiel 3:14; 8:3). We may infer from this variation in the practice of inspired writers that, though symbolical, anthropomorphic language is not always equally necessary in speaking of Divine things, yet it cannot be entirely dispensed with, even by the most gifted and spiritual teachers. Thou hast filled me with indignation; rather, thou hadst filled me. Jeremiah was too full of his Divine message to indulge in impracticable sentimentalities. There was no thought of self when Jeremiah received his mission, nor any bitterness towards those who up-posed him. His \"indignation\" was that of Jehovah, whose simple instrument he was (comp. Jeremiah 6:11, \"I am full of the fury of the Lord\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Why is my pain perpetual? One who could honestly speak of himself in terms such as those of Vers. 16, 17, seemed to have a special claim on the Divine protection. But Jeremiah's hopes have been disappointed. His vexation is perpetual, and his wounded spirit finds no comfort. As a liar; rather, as a deceitful stream. The word \"stream\" has to be understood as in Micah 1:14. Many of the water courses of Palestine are filled with a rushing torrent in the winter, but dry in summer. Hence the pathetic complaint of Job (Job 6:15). The opposite phrase to that used by Jeremiah is \"a perennial stream\" (Amos 5:24). The force of the passage is increased if we read it in the light of Dr. Gratz's hypothesis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If thou return, etc. Most commentators regard these words as containing a gentle rebuke to Jeremiah for his doubts respecting God's care of him. It may be questioned, however, whether such passing doubts could be described as a turning away from Jehovah. If the word \"return\" is to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, we must surely conclude that the people is addressed (comp. Jeremiah 3:12; Jeremiah 4:1). But this does not agree with the context. Hence Gratz's view seems very plausible, that the reference is to the proposal that Jeremiah should place himself under the protection of Gedaliah (comp. Jeremiah 40:5, \"Go back also to Gedaliah,\" etc.). Then will I bring thee again; viz. into the right relation to me, so as to be my minister (Keil). But by altering one of the vowel-points (which form no part of the text), on the authority of the Septuagint, we get a more satisfactory sense, I will give thee a settled place. The verb must in any case be coupled with the following one. Jeremiah longs for a quiet home, only as supplying the conditions of prophetic activity. Thou shalt stand before me. The phrase is taken from the wont of slaves to stand in their masters' presence, waiting for commands. It is also applied to courtiers (Proverbs 22:29) and royal councilors (1 Kings 12:6), to angels (Luke 1:19) and to prophets (1 Kings 17:1; 2 Kings 3:14). Jeremiah was by God's will to find a new and important mission to the Jews with Gedaliah. If thou take forth the precious from the vile, etc. The metaphor is derived from metallurgy (comp. Jeremiah 6:27-30). The prophet is compared to a smelter. By the fervor of his inspired exhortations, he seeks to draw away from the mass of unbelievers all those who are spiritually capable of better things. The \"vine-dressers and husbandmen,\" whom Nebuzar-adan had left after the capture of Jerusalem, though outwardly \"the poor of the laud,\" might yet be ennobled by the word and example of Jeremiah. [Some explain \"the precious\" and \"the vile\" differently, taking the former to be the pure Word of God (comp. Psalm 12:6; Proverbs 30:5), the latter the base, human elements which are apt to be mixed with the Divine message (comp. Jeremiah 23:28). But was it not the very fidelity of Jeremiah which exposed him to the persecutions of which he has been complaining? Others suppose an inward purification of Jeremiah himself to be intended, \"the vile\" being those human infirmities of which he had just given evidence, as opposed to \"the precious,\" i.e. the spiritual impulses which come from above. But is not such an explanation too evangelical, too Pauline, for this context?] Thou shalt be as my mouth. For devoting himself to this possible \"mustard seed\" of a better and holier people, the prophet should be rewardedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) by close prophetic intercourse with his God, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2), as the next clause states, by a moral victory over his opponents. \"Mouth\" for \"prophet,\" as Exodus 4:16 (comp. Exodus 7:1). Let them return unto thee, etc.; rather, they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them. They shall come over to thy side, and thou shalt not need to make humiliating advances to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And I will make thee, etc.; a solemn confirmation of the promises in Jeremiah 1:18, 19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Out of the hand of the wicked, etc. The \"wicked\" (literally, evil) and the \"terrible\" may be the banditti, composed of desperate patriots, who ultimately assassinated Gedaliah (Jeremiah 41:1-3).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou shalt not take thee a wife. So St. Paul, \"I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is (1 Corinthians 7:26, Revised Version); and Hosea has already drawn an awful picture of \"Ephraim bringing forth his children to the murderer\" (Hosea 9:9). In ordinary times it was a kind of unwritten law among the Israelites to marry and beget children. Most of the prophets (e.g. Isaiah) appear to have been married. In this place; i.e. in the land of Judah. A Jeremianic phrase (comp. Jeremiah 7:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Grievous deaths; literally, deaths of sicknesses; i.e. all kinds of painful deaths, including (as Jeremiah 14:18 shows) death by starvation. They shall not be lamented. The absence of sepulture has already been pointed to several times as a feature of the horror of the times (Jeremiah 8:2; Jeremiah 14:16; comp. Jeremiah 7:33), but this is a new and affecting touch. Dr. Payne Smith aptly refers to the plagues of Athens and London, in which the gentler elements of human nature were for the time almost extinguished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Compare this prohibition with that given to Ezekiel (Ezekiel 24:15-27), The house of mourning; literally, cf. screaming (an uncommon word, only occurring again - of banqueters - in Amos 6:7). It is, no doubt, the wail of mourning relatives which is meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald. Both practices are forbidden in the Law (Deuteronomy 14:1; Leviticus 19:28; Leviticus 21:5), but the prohibition was at any rate unknown to the masses (see, for the former, Jeremiah 41:5; Jeremiah 47:5; and for the latter, Jeremiah 47:5; Isaiah 22:12, \"The Lord Jehovah called... to baldness;\" Amos 8:10; Micah 1:16; Ezekiel 7:18). St. Jerome remarks, and incidentally gives a valuable evidence of the tenacity of primitive customs, \"Mos hic fuit apud veteres, et usque hodie in quibusdam permanet Judaerum, ut in luctibus incidant lacertos,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Tear themselves for them. The verb is used in Isaiah 58:7 of breaking bread (the accusative is there expressed), and there is no doubt that this is the meaning here. The only question is whether lahem, for them, should not rather be lekhem, bread (this was read by the Septuagint, Peshito, Vulgate, Targnm). St. Jerome sees here an allusion to the funeral feasts (comp. the parentalia), and surely he is right. The Jews had a conception of the nature of the life of the other world only less distinct than that of their Egyptian neighbors. The funeral feast was not merely for the living, but for the dead. Indeed, it was primarily intended for the spiritual nourish-merit of those who had gone before to the unseen world (comp. Bonwick, 'Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought,' p. 48). Chardin, the old traveler, asserts that \"the Oriental Christians still make banquets of this kind by a custom derived from the Jews.\" The cup of consolation.

The connection here would be improved by insorting the passage before Ver. 18; and as displacements are not unfamiliar phenomena in manuscripts, this would not be a violent act. The difficulty is not m the therefore introducing the promise, which frequently occurs in prophecies immediately after threatenings (e.g., Isaiah 10:23, 24), as if to say, \"Things being in such a miserable plight, your God will interpose to help you;\" but in the position of Ver. 18. How can the prophet say, \"And first I will recompense their iniquity double,\" when Vers. 16, 17 contain a description of this very double recompense?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - I will send for should rather be, I will send. Fishers and hunters, by a divinely given impulse, shall \"fish\" and \"hunt\" the unhappy fugitives from their lurking-places. There may, perhaps, be an allusion to the cruel ancient practice of \"sweeping the country with a drag-net\" (Herod, 3:149), and then destroying the male population: Samos, e.g. was thus \"netted\" and depopulated by the Persians. Habakkuk may also refer to this when he says (Habakkuk 1:15), \"They catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - First - i.e. before \"I bring them back again into their land\" - I will recompense... double; i.e. amply, in full measure (comp. Jeremiah 17:18; Isaiah 40:2; Revelation 18:6). With the carcasses, etc. The idols, which \"defile the consciences\" of those who worship them, are compared to the most unclean and loathsome objects.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, etc. Jeremiah falls into the tone of the psalmists (Psalm 18:2; Psalm 28:8; Psalm 59:17). All that is choicest and most permanent in Old Testament religion finds its adequate lyric expression in the Book of Psalms. The Gentiles shall some unto thee. The article, however, is not expressed. \"Nations.\" i.e. a crowd of peoples, hitherto ignorant of the true God, shall hasten to the scene of Jehovah's great interposition; they have been convinced by Israel's unlooked-for restoration of the unique divinity of Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But the Jews of this generation, in spite of the manifold proofs of the true religion which have been vouchsafed to them, are deserting the real divinity for the unreal.

There will be no further grace-time. I will this once cause them to know; rather, I will this time (comp. on Jeremiah 10:18) cause them to acknowledge. The judgment which Jeremiah has had the sad duty of announcing will prove to the blinded Jews that Jehovah alone is true God, alone can strike and heal.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The sin of Judah, etc. \"Judah's sin\" is not merely their tendency to sin, but their sinful practices - their idolatry. This is said to be graven upon the table of their heart, for it is no mere form, but carried on with passionate earnestness, and as indelible as if engraved with an iron pen. How unlike, however, is this record to that of which the same expression is used in Job 19:24! With the point of a diamond; or, with a point of adamant (harder than flint, as Ezekiel 3:9 says). Fragments of adamant, says Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:15), are sought out by engravers and enclosed in iron; they easily overcome every hardness. Upon the horns of your altars. First of all, what altars are referred to? Those erected for the worship of idols or the two in the temple of Jehovah, which had been defiled by idolatry? And why is the sin of Judah said to be engraved upon the horns of the altars? Probably because the \"horns,\" i.e. the projections at the four upper corners (Exodus 28:2) were smeared with the blood of the victims. The direction in Exodus 29:12 and Leviticus 4:7 was doubtless not peculiar to the ritual of the Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Whilst their children remember, etc. The connection of this with the preceding verse is rather obscure. Probably it is intended as an exemplification of the \"sin of Judah,\" the inveterateness of which is shown by their thoughts spontaneously turning to the altars and symbols of the false gods whenever they are near a leafy tree or a high hill (probably \"under the green trees\" is the right reading; comp. 1 Kings 14:23; so Targum). To make \"their sons\" the accusative (with Hitzig and Keil), rendering, \"As they remember their children, [even so they remember their altars],\" seems unnatural; why should \"children\" and \"altars\" be associated in idea? Groves; rather, idols of Asherah, the Canaanitish goddess.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - O my mountain in the field; a still more obscure passage. The question is whether \"my mountain in the field\" is a vocative or an accusative dependent on \"I will give.\" If the former, then the phrase will mean Jerusalem (comp. \"rock of the plain,\" Jeremiah 21:13). This, however, does not suit with the second half of the verse (\"thy high places,\" etch), and still less with ver. 4, which evidently refers to the people of Judah. Added to this, if Jerusalem were here addressed we should certainly expect feminine suffixes. It remains to take \"my mountain,\" etc., as an accusative. It describes, not Jerusalem, but Mount Zion as the site of the temple, the mountain of the house of Jehovah (Isaiah 2:3; Zechariah 8:3; Psalm 24:3). Render, therefore, my mountain in the field will I give. The prophet magnifies Zion into a mountain with a widely extended prospect (comp. ver. 12 and Jeremiah 21:13). Thy substance and all thy treasures; i.e. these of the people. The part of the verse which begins here is almost the same as Jeremiah 15:13 (see note). And thy high places for sin. Keil explains, Jehovah declares that he will, on account of the sinful practices upon them, deliver up the high places throughout the land. Gesenius, \"He will deliver up the high places with the sin attaching to them;\" Hitzig, \"as a sin offering.\" There is a question, however, whether there is not a corruption in the text, and whether we should not read, with Ewald, \"without price for thy sins\" (as in the parallel passage, Jeremiah 15:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - (Comp. Jeremiah 15:14.) Even thyself; literally, even with thyself, i.e. with thy bare life (if the text, which is here evidently rather out of order, is correct). Shalt discontinue. The word involves an allusion to the Law in Exodus 23:11 and (especially) Deuteronomy 15:2 (see the Hebrew). The latter passage suggests a correction of the difficult \"even with thyself,\" just preceding, into \"thy hand.\" Thus we get for the opening of this verse, \"And thou shalt let loose thy hand\" (i.e. as Authorized Version, \"shalt discontinue\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11. - In the higher gnomic or proverbial style. God and man, flesh and spirit, are natural antitheses (comp. Isaiah 31:3; Psalm 56:4). The prayer of the believer is, \"Be thou (O Jehovah) their arm every morning;\" not Egypt, not Assyria, not any \"arm of flesh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Like the heath in the desert; as forlorn as some well-known desert plant. But which plant? St. Jerome explains, \"Et erit quasi myrice ['tamarisk'], quae Hebraice dicitur Aroer (?) sire, at interpretatus est Syrus, lignum infructuosum.\" The versions agree in supposing the comparison to be to a plant; and a very similar word in Arabic (ghargar) means the mountain juniper; Tristram, the dwarf juniper. Most, however, take the word to be an adjective equivalent to \"destitute.\" Dr. Thomson tells a story of a poor destitute woman he found in the desert (comp. Jeremiah 48:6 - the form there is Aroer, here it is 'ar'ar; Psalm 102:18). Shall not see; i.e. shall not perceive, or feel any evil consequences (comp. Isaiah 44:16, \"I have seen the fire,\" equivalent to \"feel the flame\"). A salt land; i.e. one entirely barren (comp.

The Authorized Version represents that of the margin, which is conformed to ver. 6, but is against the parallelisms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - The crocked devices of the human heart, which is characterized as deceitful above all things (or, as Delitzsch, ' Biblical Psychology,' English translation, p. 340, \"proud;\" literally, uneven or rugged; comp. Isaiah 40:4; Habakkuk 2:4, Hebrew; Psalm 131:2, Hebrew), and desperately wicked, or rather, desperately sick (see Jeremiah 15:18, where it is explained by the words, \"which refuseth to be healed\"). The Septuagint reads this verse differently, \"The heart is deep above all things, and it is a man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As the partridge... hatcheth them not; rather, as the partridge sitteth on eggs which it hath not laid; a proverbial illustration of the Divine retributive justice. The prophet assumes the truth of a popular belief respecting the partridge (still a common bird in Judaea), that it brooded upon eggs which it had not laid. As the young birds soon leave the false mother, so unjustly acquired riches soon forsake their possessors. [Canon Tristram rejects this explanation, on the ground that the statement is not true to natural history; the partridge neither steals the broods of others nor needs to do so, as it lays a very large number of eggs. But grammar requires us to translate as suggested above, and consequently excludes any other explanation-May not the unusually large number of the eggs laid by the partridge have led to the fancy that they could not be all its own?]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - An address to Jehovah in two parts, the first specially referring to the temple regarded as the sacramental symbol of the Divine presence (comp. Psalm 5:7), the second to Jehovah himself. It seems to us, no doubt, singular thus practically to identify, Jehovah and his temple; but the prophet s meaning is that God can only be addressed in so far as he has revealed himself. The temple was not, strictly speaking, the \"Name or revelation of God, but it was \"the place of the Name of Jehovah,\" and in the language of strong feeling might be addressed as if it were really the Divine Name. The disciples of the incarnate Name were familiar with the idea that their Master was in some sense the antitype of the temple (Matthew 12:6; John 2:19). In proposing this explanation, it has been tacitly assumed that the Authorized Version, A glorious high throne... is the place of our sanctuary, is wrong. Grammatically, indeed, it is not indefensible; but it is a weak rendering in such a context. Render, therefore, Thou throne of glory, a height from the beginning, thou place of our sanctuary, thou hope of Israel, Jehovah. The temple is called \"the throne of thy glory\" in Jeremiah 14:21; \"height\" is a common synonym for heaven (Psalm 7:8, Hebrew; Isaiah 57:15, Hebrew), but is also applied to Mount Zion (Ezekiel 17:23; Ezekiel 20:40, quoted by Keil), which is also in Isaiah 60:13 called, \"the place of my sanctuary.\" By adding the concluding words of the address (at the opening of ver. 13), the prophet prevents the suspicion that he attached importance to the mere outward buildings of the temple, like those formalist Jews, whose words are quoted in Jeremiah 7:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They that depart from me. The abrupt change of person is extremely harsh; the Vulgate, followed by Ewald and Olshausen, supposes that a final caph has dropped out, rendering, \"they that depart from thee.\" Shall be written in the earth; a contrast to that which is recorded for all time \"with a pen of iron\" (ver. 1). The fountain, etc.; a favorite phrase of our prophet (see Jeremiah 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHeal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-18. - A prayer of the prophet in this his hour of need. He who makes his boast of Jehovah may reckon upon his help. This is Jeremiah's principle. He prays for healing, Heal me... and I shall be - rather, that I may be - healed. He is one of those \"broken in heart,\" whom Jehovah alone can \"heal\" (Psalm 147:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The occasion of this prayer is the hostility of his neighbors, and their mocking question, Where is the word of the Lord? The prophecy seems to be floating as it were in mid-air, unable to alight (Isaiah 9:8) and fulfill itself, so that Jeremiah could be plausibly treated as a false prophet (Deuteronomy 18:22). Hence, as Keil remarks, the discourse of which this forms the conclusion must have been spoken before the first Babylonian invasion of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee; i.e. I have not eagerly withdrawn from following thee as a shepherd (or prophet). The prophet does not follow his own vague inclinations; he is but an under-shepherd, and waits on the will of his superior. He is, as Hosea calls him (Hosea 9:7, Hebrew), \"the man of the Spirit.\" If God leads any one, whether people or individuals, it is through the agency of the Spirit (Isaiah 63:11, 12); and it is the characteristic of the typical prophet that his ear is \"wakened morning by morning\" to receive his daily lesson. Only by thus \"following\" the Divine Leader, can a prophet act as pastor to his people. [The construction is, however, rather simplified by the rendering - a perfectly legitimate one... from following thee as a companion.] The woeful day. The word for \"woeful\" is the same rendered \"desperately wicked\" (ver. 9); the \"day\" of Judah's calamity is metaphorically \"sick,\" like the heart of man. So, other words being used, Isaiah 17:11 (end). Was right before thee; rather (since some adjective must be supplied), was manifest before thee. He appeals to the all-seeing Eye as a witness to his fidelity to his mission.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Jeremiah reckons on Jehovah's protection; he therefore entreats that his God will not bring him to shame by leaving his prophecies unfulfilled. A terror is a weak rendering; a consternation would be better.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - (On this terrible execration, with reference to Jeremiah's character, see the general Introduction.) Destroy them with double destruction. \"Double\" here means \"amply sufficient\" (comp. Revelation 18:6, and see on Jeremiah 16:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-27. - An exhortation to a more strict observance of the Sabbath. The reward held out is Jerusalem's continuance in all its old pomp, both temporal and spiritual, and the penalty the destruction of the city by fire. This passage stands in absolutely no connection with the preceding and the following prophecies; and we have just the same sense of suspicion in meeting with it here, in the midst of perfectly general exhortations, as in reading the parallel exhortations to Sabbath-keeping in Isaiah 56. and 58, surrounded as they are by the moving and almost evangelical rhetoric of the second part of Isaiah. Geiger and Dr. Rowland Williams have hence been led to conjecture that this section (or part of it) was introduced into the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies to assist the reforming movement of Ezra and Nehemiah. Certainly the regard for the Sabbath, so conspicuous in the later Judaism, dates, so far as we can see, from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (see Nehemiah 13.), though it is credible enough that the perception of the high importance of this holy day (comp. Heine's 'Prinecssin Sabbath') began to acquire greater distinctness as the other parts of the social and religions organization were seen to be fading away (comp. art. \"Sabbath\" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). Verse 19. - In the gate of the children of the people. It is uncertain which of the gates of Jerusalem is meant, and not perfectly clear what is the meaning of the title. Does it mean Israelites as opposed to foreigners, or laymen as distinguished from priests? Whereby the kings of Judah come in. Jeremiah appears to use the phrase \"kings of Judah\" in a particular sense (see on ver. 20). He may, no doubt, simply mean to say that those who are from time to time sovereigns of Judah enter by this gate. But once grant that the prophet does sometimes use the phrase in a sense of his own, and that in the very next verse, and it is very difficult to avoid interpreting it so in this passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Jeremiah addresses himself first of all to the kings of Judah. As it would be very unnatural for a public orator to appeal to the yet unborn members of the reigning dynasty, and as there are several indications that the \"house of David\" was able at this period, as also in that of Isaiah, to exercise a decisive political and civil influence, even, as appears from Jeremiah 21:11, 12, monopolizing the judicial functions, it is natural to suppose that \"kings of Judah\" is here used in a very special sense, via. of the members of the various branches of the royal family (\"The sons of the king,\" Zephaniah 1:8; comp. Jeremiah 36:26, \"Jerahmeel, a king's son\"), and their descendants, who received the royal title by courtesy (parallels for this will be found in Gesenius's 'Hebrew Thesaurus,' s.v.me'lek). The queen-mother was probably the leader of this plan; \"the mistress,\" as she was called (see on Jeremiah 13:18), and the royal princes (among whom the \"house of Nathan,\" Zechariah 12:12, would doubtless be reckoned), constituted in fact a body almost as numerous as they did (according to Brugsch Bey) in Egypt, and politically much more influential; so much so indeed that only a king of unusual force of character, like Hezekiah or Josiah, could venture, and that timidly, to oppose them. The weak-principled Zedekiah seems to have been entirely dominated by this powerful caste, and to have been little more than a maire du palais (the same sense of the phrase is required in Jeremiah 19:8, and probably in Jeremiah 25:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Take heed to yourselves; rather, Take heed heartily, conscientiously; literally, in your souls.

Shall remain forever; rather, shall be inhabited forever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Parallel passage for the catalogue of the districts of Judah, Jeremiah 32:44. Three divisions are mentioned.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The neighborhood of Jerusalem (including the \"cities of Judah\");NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the land of Benjamin, i.e. the northern part of the kingdom; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the tribe of Judah, with its three subdivisions - the Shefela or lowland country by the Mediterranean Sea, the hill country, and the Negeb or \"dry\" south country (comp. Joshua 15:21-62). The sacrifices are described with equal explicitness; they fall into two classes, the bloody (burnt offerings and other sacrifices) and the unbloody (the vegetable offering or minkhah, and the incense which was strewed upon the min-khah, Leviticus 2:1). And bringing sacrifices of praise. This was, no doubt, the title of a particular variety of sacrifices (Leviticus 7:12; Leviticus 22:29); here, however, it seems as if all the preceding sacrifices were summed up under this designation. St. Paul says, \"In everything give thanks;\" and this seems to have been the prophet's ideal of the sacrifices of the future.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah17:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - The simple and familiar craft of the potter becomes a parable of religious truth (comp.

But the moral element in Jeremiah's teaching stands outside this, viz. that the Divine action is governed, not by mere caprice, but a regard for character. \"The thought is not so much the arbitrariness as the patience of God, who will bring men to be what he would have them be in the end, as the potter eventually twists the clay to the shape he originally intended, stubborn as the clay may be.\" But whether Jeremiah meant the lesson which Mr. Maurice deduces from his words may be gravely doubted. It is not of individuals that the prophet is thinking, but of the nation, and not of the nation as destined to be all but certainly saved, but as placed before a serious and awful decision. (For different lessons derived from the same figure, see the ' Rabbi Ben Ezra' of Browning.) Egypt and Palestine were, as it seems, at one in the extreme simplicity of the potter's art. Dr. Birch has given us an account of the Egyptian potter at his work, as he appears in the pictorial representations at Beni Hassan ('Ancient Pottery,' pp. 33-35), and Dr. Thomson has described the procedure of a potter in modern Palestine ('The Land and the Book,' p. 520). The chief difference between them seems to be that in Egypt the wheel was turned with the left hand, and the vase shaped with the right, while in modern Palestine the wheel is turned with the fool \"Taking a lump in his hand,\" says Dr. Thomson, \"he placed it on the top of the wheel (which revolves horizontally), and smoothed it into a low cone, like the upper end of a sugar-loaf; then thrusting his thumb into the top of it, he opened a hole down through the center, and this he constantly widened by pressing the edges of the revolving cone between his hands. As it enlarged and became thinner, he gave it whatever shape he pleased with the utmost ease and expedition.\" It should be observed that in ver. 3 the \"wheels,\" or rather \"two wheels,\" spoken of are simply the two round plates which formed the horizontal lathe of the potter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And the vessel that he made, etc.; rather, And whensoever the vessel... was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vesselNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD.

Ezekiel 33:17, 20). There is no hope. The rendering may be easily misunderstood. The speakers are not, as we might suppose, despondent about their state and prospects, but they seek to check the troublesome preacher by the warning that he has no chance of success (so Jeremiah 2:25). Imagination; rather, stubbornness (as constantly).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Will a man leave the anew of Lebanon, etc.? This passage is unusually obscure. Literally we must, it would seem, render, Doth the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field (or possibly, cease to flow from the rock unto the field)? This is explained as pointing a contrast to the infidelity of God's people. \"The snow never leaves the summit of Lebanon; the waters which take their rise therein never dry up; but my people have forgotten the law of their being, the source of their prosperity.\" The rendering of the first clause is, however, grammatically dubious (there is no example of this construction of 'azabh), and all the old versions point to (or at least favor) a reading, Shaddai (the Almighty) instead of sadai (the field). If we keep the text, we must explain \"the rock of the field\" on the analogy of \"my mountain in the field\" (Jeremiah 17:3), as meaning \"the rock which commands a wide prospect over the open lowland country,\" i.e. Mount Lebanon. The cold flowing waters; i.e. the numerous \"streams from Lebanon,\" referred to in Song of Solomon 4:15. That come from another place; i.e. whoso sources are foreign. But as this does not suit the connection, it is better to take the Hebrew word (zarim), usually rendered \"foreign,\" in the sense of \"pressing or hurrying along,\" with Ewald, Graf, and virtually Henderson. It thus becomes descriptive of these streams \"as contracted within narrow channels while descending through the gorges and defiles of the rocks.\" Camp. \"like an oppressing stream,\" Isaiah 59:19 (a cognate verb). Be forsaken. The Hebrew text has \"be plucked up' (i.e. destroyed?); but as this is unsuitable, we must transpose two letters (as in not a few other cases), and render, dry up. So Gesenius, Graf, Keil, Delitzsch, and Payne Smith.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Because my people hath forgotten me; rather, Surely, etc.; or better still, Yet surely. It is not uncommon for a particle of asseveration to acquire a contrasting force from the context; see e.g. Jeremiah 3:20; Isaiah 53:4; and, still more completely parallel, Isaiah 2:6; Jeremiah 9:1, where Authorized Version, with substantial correctness, has \"nevertheless.\" Israel \"forgot\" Jehovah (as Jeremiah 2:32); no doubt he was responsible for so doing, but still it was not \"of malice preponse.\" To vanity; i.e. to the unreal idol-gods. And they have caused them to stumble; viz. the idol-gods; these are responsible (.for they have a real existence in the consciousness of their worshippers) for this interruption of Israel's spiritual progress (comp. 2 Chronicles 28:23). In their ways from the ancient paths. \"From,\" however, is interpolated by the Authorized Version; the Hebrew places \"the ancient paths\" in apposition to \"their ways,\" \"Stand ye in the ways,\" Jeremiah cried at an earlier period, \"and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way\" (Jeremiah 6:16). These \"old\" or \"ancient\" paths were ideally \"their ways,\" the ways appointed for the Jews to walk in. To walk in paths; rather, in tracks, footpaths leading up and down and often ending in nothing; or, in other terms, in a way not cast up (Isaiah 40:3, 4, gives a graphic picture of the operation of \"casting up a way\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The effect of this is to make the land of the transgressors an object of horror and astonishment (so render rather than desolate).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - As with an east wind.

I wilt show them the back; as they have done to Jehovah (Jeremiah 2:27; Jeremiah 32:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-23. - A fresh conspiracy (comp. Jeremiah 11:18), called forth by the preceding discourse; Jeremiah's prayer. Verse 18. - The law - or rather, direction, instruction, which was a special function of the priests (Deuteronomy 33:10; Deuteronomy 17:9-11) - shall not perish from the priest. The Jews were but obeying the Deuteronomic Law (on which Jeremiah, as we have seen, laid so much stress) in alluding to the priests. Unhappily, the priests in Jeremiah's time (Jeremiah 2:26), as in Isaiah's (Isaiah 28:7), were forgetful of their high mission. Nor counsel from the wise. The wise men formed an important order in Jewish society, the importance of which in the Divine education of Israel has not been sufficiently recognized. It was their custom to sit in public places, generally in the chambered recess in the city gate, and give advice on questions of moral practice to those who applied for it. But there were wise men and wise men. Some appear, to have \"mocked\" at the earnest preaching of the prophets (hence the solemn rebukes in the Book of Proverbs), others to have as it were prepared the way for the latter by a more or less distinct recognition of the religious foundation of morality, and of these we have ample monuments in the canonical Proverbs. There may also have been other shades and varieties of wise men, for their characteristic was not a faculty of intuition, but rather of reflectively applying fundamental moral principles. One highly esteemed branch of \"wisdom\" would, of course, be political, and this would be the most liable to perversion. It is of such (Proverbs 29:14). Nor the word from the prophet. \"The word\" is a general term for prophesying. Of course, the speakers take no account of the advance in prophecy from the time, at any rate, of Amos. They are satisfied with the lower order of prophets (\"false prophets,\" as the Septuagint calls them); but still they are afraid of Jeremiah, much as Balak was afraid of Balaam, when that soothsayer was blessing Israel (Numbers 23:25). Smite him with the tongue; i.e. by slanderous accusations. The same figure as in Jeremiah 9:3, 8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - Them that contend with me.

They have digged a pit, etc. Comp. Psalm 57:6. To speak good for them. See Jeremiah's intercessions in Jeremiah 14:7-9, 19-22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul.

The sword is personified. Let their men he put to death; another personification, for the Hebrew has \"slain of Death\" - pestilence is referred to, as Jeremiah 15:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Let them be overthrown before thee; i.e. count them as those who have been brought to ruin. This explanation seems required by the parallelism, the companion clause meaning \"do not regard their sin as cancelled.\" The ruin may be either spiritual or temporal; the parallelism favors the former (comp. ver. 14; Hosea 14:10, where \"fall\" should be \"stumble\"). Deal thus with them. \"Thus\" is interpolated by the Authorized Version; \"deal\" should rather be deal terribly (\"deal\" is constantly used in a pregnant sense; see on Jeremiah 14:7).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - A potter's earthen bottle. Dr. Thomson speaks of the extreme cheapness and brittleness of the common pottery of Palestine (comp. Isaiah 30:14). The ancients of the people. The natural popular representatives (comp. Exodus 3:16; 2 Samuel 19:11; 1 Kings 8:1; 1 Kings 20:7). It was an announcement concerning the whole people that Jeremiah was about to make.

The east gate; rather the potsherd gate, i.e. the gate where potsherds were wont to be thrown. Another possible rendering is \"sun gate,\" of which \"east gate\" is but a paraphrase. But there is evidently a connection between the name of the gate and the action performed by Jeremiah. The Authorized Version seems to have misled Captain Warren into identifying the valley of Hinnom with that of Kedron. He confirms his view, it is true, by the Arabic nomenclature, which speaks of the Kedron as the Wady Jehinnam - a nomenclature, however, which is by no means uniform (see Robinson, 'Biblical Researches,' 2:396, 403). The situation of the \"potsherd gate\" must remain uncertain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - O kings of Judah; i.e. the numerous clan of royal princes, kings by courtesy (see on Jeremiah 17:20).

And they shall bury them in Tophet, etc. These words form the conclusion of Jeremiah 7:32 (see note), the greater part of which is repeated in ver. 6. They are certainly out of place here, and are wanting in the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - As Tophet; i.e. an unclean spot, avoided by mankind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The houses of the kings of Judah; i.e. the palaces and other buildings which together made up the king's house (Jeremiah 22:6). Shall he defiled as the place of Tophet. This is one of the few places in which the Authorized Version has allowed itself to interfere with the received text; for the Hebrew has \"which are defiled,\" etc. The common reading, in fact, seems untranslatable. Because of all the houses; rather, even all the houses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - Here begins a fresh section of the narrative.

This introductory formula only occurs here and in Amos 1:1. The editor of Jeremiah and of Amos deserts the usual phrase (\"burden\" or , \"utterance,\" \"vision,\" \"the word of the LORD which came,\" etc.) in order to give fuller information concerning the origin of the prophetic writers (but see on ver. 2). On the name Jeremiah, and on the position occupied by Hilkiah, see Introduction. That were in Anathoth. So Vulgate; Septuagint, however (followed by Payne Smith), makes the relative refer to Jeremiah (ὅς κατῴκει). But in this case would not the phrase have been \"Jeremiah the priest,\" etc. (comp. Ezekiel 1:1)? Anathoth was one of the priestly cities (Joshua 21:18); it lay on or near the great northern road (Isaiah 10:30), and has been identified by Dr. Robinson (so also by Lieutenant Conder) with 'Anata, situated on a ridge, an hour and a quarter north-northeast from Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Unto the end of the eleventh year, etc. The limit is accurate with regard to Jeremiah 1-39.

Genesis 39:6; Amos 3:2; Isaiah 58:3; Psalm 144:3). Observe, the predestination of individuals is a familiar idea in the Old Testament (comp. Isaiah 45:4; Isaiah 49:1; Psalm 139:16). It was also familiar to the Assyrians: King Assurba-nipal declares at the opening of his ' Annals ' that the gods \"in the body of his mother have made (him) to rule Assyria.\" Familiar, too, to the great family of religious reformers. For, as Dean Milman has truly observed, \"No Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution. He who is destined for such a work must have a full conviction that God is acting directly, immediately, consciously, and therefore with irresistible power, upon him and through him He who is not predestined, who does not declare, who does not believe himself predestined as the author of a great religions movement, he in whom God is not manifestly, sensibly, avowedly working out his pre-established designs, will never be saint or reformer\" ('Latin Christianity,' 1:111, 112). Sanctified thee; i.e. set thee apart for holy uses. Ordained; rather, appointed. Unto the nations. Jeremiah's prophecies, in fact, have reference not only to Israel, but to the peoples in relation to Israel (ver. 10; Jeremiah 25:15, 16; Jeremiah 46-49; Jeremiah 50 and Jeremiah 51.?).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Ah, Lord God! rather, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! It is a cry of alarm and pain, and recurs in Jeremiah 4:10; Jeremiah 14:13; Jeremiah 32:17. I am a child. I am too young to support such an office. The word rendered \"child\" is used elsewhere of youths nearly grown up (comp. Genesis 34:19; Genesis 41:12; 1 Kings 3:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou shalt go, etc. Thoughts of self are altogether out of place in one who has received a Divine commission. Jeremiah's duty is simple obedience. In put-suing this path he cannot but be safe (ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Touched my mouth; literally, caused (his hand) to touch my mouth. Jeremiah had said that he was unskilled in oratory; the Divine answer is that the words which he has to speak are not his own, but those of Jehovah. Two things are obvious:NEWLINENEWLINE1. The touching of the lips is not purely metaphorical, as in Psalm 51:15 (comp. Psalm 40:6); it represents a real experience.NEWLINENEWLINE2. This experience, however, can only have been a visionary one, analogous to that vouchsafed to Isaiah at the opening of his prophetic ministry. In the grand account given by Isaiah of his inaugural vision (which has evidently influenced the form of the vision of Jeremiah), we read of the same significant act on the part of one of the seraphim. It is the same act, certainly, but it symbolizes, not as here the communication of a prophetic message (comp. Matthew 10:19), but the purification of the lips. Does it not seem as if Isaiah had attained a deeper insight into the spiritual regeneration needed by the prophet than had been granted to Jeremiah? Another point in which Jeremiah's account seems inferior to that of Isaiah is plastic power. Notice how Jeremiah dwells upon the meaning of the words; this is a reflective element which diminishes the poetic power of the narrative. A word may Be added to explain that \"visionary\" is not here used in opposition to \"based on fact.\" That the two epithets are susceptible of combination is well shown in the vision described by Pere Gratry, in his 'Souvenirs do ma Jeunesse' (pp. 102-105), the reality of which is not in the least impaired in the writer's mind by its thoroughly inward character: \"Dens teutes ces seines interieures, je n'imaginais rien... c'etaient de saisissantes et tres-energiques realites auxquelles je ne m'attendais nullement.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSee, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I have set thee; literally, I have made thee an overseer, or vicegerent (comp. Genesis 41:34; Judges 9:28, where the Authorized Version renders the cognate noun \"officer\"). To root out... to plant, viz. by pronouncing that Divine judgment which fulfils itself (comp. Jeremiah 5:14; Numbers 23:25; Isaiah 9:8, 9; Isaiah 55:11). As there is so much more threatening than promise in Jeremiah's writings, the destructive side of his activity is expressed by four verbs, the constructive only by two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-16. - Two trials or probations of Jeremiah's inner sight (2 Kings 6:17). Two visions are granted him, which he is required to describe. The first expresses the certainty of his prophetic revelation; the second indicates its contents. Verse 11. - A rod of an almond tree. The name here adopted for the almond tree is peculiarly suitable in this connection. It means \"wakeful;\" the almond, blossoming in January, is the first to \"wake\" from the sleep of winter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will hasten my word; literally, I am wakeful over my word; alluding to the meaning of the Hebrew word for almond.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A seething pot. There is a variety of Hebrew words for \"pot.\" The word here used suggests a vessel of large size, since pottage for a whole company of prophets could be cooked in such. a pot or caldron (2 Kings 4:38). From Ezekiel 24:11 we may infer that it was of metal. A \"seething pot\" in ancient Arabic poetry is a figure for war. The same symbol occurs in Ezekiel 24:3-12, but with a different application. The face thereof is toward the north; rather, toward the south; literally, from the face of the north. The \"face\" of the pet is the side turned to the prophet. We may suppose the contents to be on the point of boiling over.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Out of the north. Previously to the battle of Carchemish, the Babylonians are only mentioned vaguely as a northern people (see Jeremiah 4:6; Jeremiah 6:1, 22; Jeremiah 10:22). Strictly speaking, they were an eastern people from the point of view of Palestine; but the caravan-road which the Chaldaean armies had to take entered Palestine at Dan (comp. Jeremiah 4:15; Jeremiah 8:16), and then proceeded southward. (On the question whether a Scythian invasion is referred to, at least conjointly with the Babylonian, see Introduction.) An evil; rather, the evil; viz. the calamity which in deepening gloom forms the burden of the prophet's discourses. Shall break forth; literally, shall open; i.e. let loose by opening (comp. the use of the same verb in Isaiah 14:17, literally, \"looseth not his prisoners homewards;\" and Amos 8:5, literally, \"that we may open,\" i.e. \"bring forth wheat\"). There is, however, some difficulty in explaining the choice of this expression. We might indeed suppose that the caldron had a lid, and that the removal or falling off of this lid is the \"opening\" referred to by the phrase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I will call; literally, I am calling; i.e. I am about to call. The kingdoms of the north; alluding possibly to the varied origin of the population of Assyria and Babylonia. But more probably it is simply a suggestive phrase, for the wide extent of the hostile empire referred to (comp. Jeremiah 25:9). They shall set every one his throne, etc. The kings, or. the, generals, representing \"all the families, etc., shall set up the high seat of power and judicial authority at the broad space within the gate of the city, which constituted the Oriental forum (comp. Genesis 23:10; Joshua 20:4; Job 29:7; Job 31:21). Thither the besieged would have to come to surrender themselves (2 Kings 24:12) and to hear their fate. A similar prediction is made with regard to Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 43:9, 10). It is true the seat of authority is there said to be placed at the entrance of the palace, but this was in fact another place where justice was wont to be administered (Jeremiah 22:2, 3). Jerome's view, adopted by Rosenmüller and Nagelsbach, that \"to set one's seat\" means \"to besiege\" is against usage, and does not accord with the opening words of ver. 16. There is, however, an element of truth in it. The judgment executed ministerially by the northern kings or generals began with the siege of Jerusalem and the other cities, and hence the words with which the prophet continues. And against all the walls, etc. We should have expected something like \"and shall set themselves in array against,\" etc. (comp. Isaiah 22:7 b); see, however, last note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will utter my judgments; or, I will hold a court of justice upon them; literally, I will speak judgments with them. The expression is peculiar to Jeremiah (comp. Jeremiah 4:12; Jeremiah 12:1; Jeremiah 39:6; Jeremiah 52:9), and includes both the examination of the accused, and the judicial sentence (see Jeremiah 39:5; Jeremiah 52:9). All their wickedness, etc. Their \"wickedness,\" i.e. their infidelity to Jehovah, showed itself in burning incense to \"other gods,\" and bowing down to their images. \"Burned incense\" is, however, too narrow a sense. The root-meaning of the verb is to be fragrant, and the causative conjugations will strictly mean only \"to make a sweet odor,\" whether by the offering of incense or by burnt offerings (comp. Jeremiah 11:12; 2 Kings 23:8, where a causative conjugation is used in the same wide sense here postulated; also Psalm 66:15 and Isaiah 1:13, where the word usually rendered \"incense\" seems rather to mean \"a sweet smoke\"). The prophet says, \"of other gods\" (not \"of false gods\"), out of consideration for the ignorance of his hearers, to whom Baal and Moloch really were as gods; in fact, that expressive word (cf.) which Isaiah uses ten times to express the unreality of the other so-called gods, occurs only once, and then not in quite the same sense (see Jeremiah 14:14) in Jeremiah. But the prophet's own strict monotheism is proved by such passages as Jeremiah 2:27a; Jeremiah 8:19b; Jeremiah 16:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Gird up thy loins, as an Oriental does before making any kind of physical exertion, whether walking (Exodus 12:11; 2 Kings 4:29), running (1 Kings 18:46), or fighting (Job 12:21). Be not dismayed. A want of confidence on Jeremiah's part will issue in his utter discomfiture by his enemies. \"Dismay\" in Hebrew has a twofold reference, subjective (\"dismay\") and objective (\"ruin,\" \"discomfiture\"). Both references can be illustrated from this verse. (Comp. the command and - ver. 18 - premise to Jeremiah with the command and promise to Ezekiel - 3:8, 9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Brasen walls. The plural is used instead of a collective term for the whole circle of fortifications. In the parallel passage (Jeremiah 15:20) the singular occurs; the same alternation of plural and singular as in 2 Kings 25:10; 1 Kings 3:1. The combination of figures strikingly expresses the invincibility of one whose strength is in his God. The kings of Judah. Why the plural? Most reply, Because Jeremiah would have to do with successive sovereigns. But this meaning would have been just as well conveyed by the singular: \"the king of Judah,\" without any name being added - would moan the king who from time to time happened to be reigning. \"Kings of Judah\" in Jeremiah seems to have a special meaning, and to include all the members of the royal family, who formed a numerous and powerful class (see on Jeremiah 17:20).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Pashur, being charged with the police of the temple, smites Jeremiah, i.e. causes stripes to be given him (a legal punishment, Deuteronomy 25:3; comp. 2 Corinthians 11:24), and then orders him to be put into the stocks; literally, that which distorts - some instrument of punishment which held the body in a bent or crooked position (comp. Jeremiah 29:26). The \"stocks\" were sometimes kept in a special house (2 Chronicles 16:10); these mentioned here, however, apparently stood in public, at the high - or rather, upper - gate of Benjamin, which was by - or, at - the house of the Lord. The gate, then, was one of the temple gates, and is called \"the upper\" to distinguish it from one of the city gates which bore the same name (Jeremiah 37:13; Jeremiah 38:7). It is presumably the same which is called \"the new gate of the Lord's house\" (Jeremiah 26:10; Jeremiah 36:10), as having been comparatively lately built (2 Kings 15:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Symbolic change of name. Not... Pashur, but Magor-missabib; i.e. terror on every side. There is probably no allusion to the (by no means obvious) etymology of Pashur. Jeremiah simply means to say that Pashur would one day become an object of general horror (see on ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The strength; rather, the stores. The labors; rather, the fruits of labor; i.e. the profits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Comp. the prophecy against Shebna (Isaiah 22:18). Since we find, in Jeremiah 29:26, Pashur's office occupied by another, it is probable that the prediction was fulfilled by the captivity of Pashur with Jehoiachin. To whom thou hast prophesied lies (comp. Jeremiah 14:13). Pashur, then, claimed to be a prophet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-13. - A lyric passage, expressing the conflict in the prophet's mind owing to the mockery and the slander which his preaching has brought upon him, and at the same time his confidence of victory through the protection of Jehovah; a suitable sequel to the narrative which goes before, even if not originally written to occupy this position (see general Introduction). Verse 7. - Thou hast deceived me, etc.; rather, thou didst entice me, and I let myself be enticed. Jeremiah refers to the hesitation he originally felt to accepting the prophetic office (Jeremiah 1.). The verb does not mean \"to deceive,\" but \"to entice\" (so rendered in ver. 10, Authorized Version), or \"allure.\" The same word is used in that remarkable narrative of \"the spirit\" who offered to \"entice\" (Authorized Version, to \"persuade\") Ahab to \"go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead\" (1 Kings 22:21). In Ezekiel, too, the same case is supposed as possible of Jehovah's \"enticing\" a prophet (Ezekiel 15:9). The expression implies that all events are, in some sense, caused by God, even those which are, or appear to be, injurious to the individual. Was Goethe thinking of this passage when he wrote the words, \"Wen Gott betrugt, ist wohl be-trogon?\" Applying the words in a Christian sense, we may say (with F. W. Robertson) that God teaches us by our illusions. Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed; rather, thou didst take hold on me, and didst prevail. The expression is like \"Jehovah spake thus to me with a grasp of the hand\" (Isaiah 8:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For since I spake, I cried out, etc.; rather, For as often as I speak, I must shout; I must cry, Violence and spoil; I can take up no other tone but that of indignant denunciation, no other theme but that of the acts of injustice constantly committed (not merely, nor indeed chiefly, against the prophet himself). Was made; rather, is made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then I said, etc.; rather, And when I say, I will not make mention of him, etc., then it becometh (i.e. I am conscious of a feeling) in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I weary myself to hold it in, but cannot. The prophet has repeatedly been tempted to withdraw from the painful duty, but his other and higher self (comp. 'Old Self and New Self' in the 'Lyra Apostolica') overpowers these lower bayings for peace and quiet. The fire of the Divine wrath against sin burns so fiercely within him that he cannot help resuming his work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For I heard, etc.; rather, For I have heard the whispering of many; there is terror on every side. Inform (say they), and let us inform against him. This gives us the reason for Ms momentary inclinations to silence. He was surrounded by bitter enemies, who were no longer content with malicious words, but urged each other on to lay an information against him with the authorities as a public criminal. The first clause agrees verbatim with part of Psalm 31:13 (this is one of the psalms attributed, by a too bold conjecture, to Jeremiah). \"There is terror on every side\" (see above, ver. 3, and also note on Jeremiah 6:25) means \"everything about me inspires me with terror.\" All my familiars is, literally, all the men of my peace; i.e. all those with whom I have been on terms of friendship (same phrase, Jeremiah 38:22). Watched for my halting; i.e. either laid traps for me or waited for me to commit some error for them to take advantage cf. The phrase, \"my halting,\" is borrowed (?) from Psalm 35:15; Psalm 38:18 (Hebrew). He will be enticed; viz. to say something on which a charge of treason can be based.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As a mighty terrible one; rather, as a formidable warrior. They shall not prevail. This was in fact, the Divine promise to Jeremiah at the outset of his ministry (Jeremiah 1:19). For they shall not prosper; rather, because they have not pros-pored.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Repeated, with slight variations, from Jeremiah 11:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - In the confidence of faith Jeremiah sees himself already delivered. He writes in the style of the psalmists, who constantly pass from the language of prayer to that of fruition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-18. - Jeremiah curses the day of his birth. The passage is a further development of the complaint in Jeremiah 15:10, and stands in no connection with the consolatory close of the preceding passage. There is a very striking parallel in Job 3:3-12, and the question cannot be evaded, Which is the original? It is difficult to believe that Jeremiah copied from an earlier poem. Deep emotion expresses itself in language suggested by the moment; and, even after retouching his discourses, Jeremiah would leave much of the original expression. But impressions of this sort cannot be unreservedly trusted. The argument from parallel passages is only a subsidiary one in the determination of the date of books.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - As the cities which the Lord overthrow. It is, so to speak, the \"technical term\" for the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah which Jeremiah employs. So deeply imprinted was the tradition on the Hebrew mind, that a special word was appropriated to it, which at once called up thoughts of the awful justice of God (see Genesis 19:25; Isaiah 1:7 (?); 13:19; Amos 4:11; Deuteronomy 29:23 [22]; Jeremiah 49:18; Jeremiah 50:40). The cry... the shouting. The cry of the besieged for help; the shouting of the suddenly appearing assailants (comp. Jeremiah 15:8).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Pashur. A different Pashur from the one mentioned in Jeremiah 20:1. This one reappears in Jeremiah 38:1; he belonged to the fifteenth of the sacerdotal families, named after Melchiah (comp. 1 Chronicles 9:12). Zephaniah, mentioned again in Jeremiah 29:25; Jeremiah 37:3. He was of the priestly family or class of Maaseiah (comp. 1 Chronicles 24:18), and was next in rank to the high priest (Jeremiah 52:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Nebuchadrezzar. This form predominates in Jeremiah and Daniel, and is the only form found in Ezekiel. It is, in fact, the correct way of spelling the name, which is in Babylonian Nabu-kudura-ucur, i.e. \"Nebo, protect [or perhaps, 'has made'] the crown.\" According to all his wondrous works; e.g., the destruction of Sennacherib, which must have occurred in the first instance to the minds of devout Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will assemble them into the midst of this city; i.e. I will compel the warriors to give up resistance, and shut themselves up within the walls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And such as are; rather, left which are left. (There has been an obvious error in the repetition of \"and.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He that abideth in this city, etc. No doubt Jeremiah often gave this counsel to his fellow-citizens (comp. Jeremiah 38:1, 17), and it appears from Jeremiah 38:19; Jeremiah 39:9; Jeremiah 52:15, that many of the Jews acted in accordance with it. Falleth; more distinctly, falleth away (as Jeremiah 37:14, Authorized Version); i.e. goeth over to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And touching the house, etc. The formula with which this section is introduced shows that it was attached to vers. 1-7 at the same time as vers. 8-10, although obviously written at a much earlier period.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - O house of David. The \"house of David\" here, as in Isaiah 7:13, means the various branches of the royal family, the same, in fact, which are called by courtesy \"kings of Judah\" in Jeremiah 17:20 (see note). They appear from the present passage to have monopolized the judicial function. Deliver him that is spoiled, etc. The poor man would have no advocate to plead for him; in this case the judge was to see that he suffered no injustice in consequence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Jehovah, standing, as it were, on the Mount of Olives, addresses the proud city beneath him. O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain; rather, O inhabitress; Jerusalem is personified as a virgin. The poetical description of the capital as a \"valley\" (the word, however, signifies a valley as wide as a plain) reminds us of \"the valley [or rather, 'ravine'] of vision\" (Isaiah 22:1, 5); While \"the rock of the plain\" recalls \"my mountain in the field\" (Jeremiah 17:3). So, as Graf points out, Babylon is called \"a mountain\" in metaphorical language (Jeremiah 51:25). It is, however, singular that the prophet should call Jerusalem a \"valley\" and a \"rock\" in the same passage. In the former, perhaps, Jeremiah is thinking specially of the lower city, and in the latter of Mount Zion. Who shall come down against us? viz. from the \"hills round about Jerusalem.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In the forest thereof; i.e. in the forest of houses (comp.

A synonymous expression is, \"As I live, saith Jehovah\" (ver. 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Unto the king's house of Judah; rather, concerning the house of the King of Judah; i.e. the royal palace, which, on account of its height and its being constructed so largely out of cedar-weed (comp. vers. 14, 23), is called \"Gilead, and the summit of Lebanon,\" just as Solomon's palace was called \"the house of the forest of Lebanon\" (1 Kings 7:2). Of Gilead in general, Canon Tristram writes, \"No one can fairly judge of Israel's heritage who has not seen the luxuriant exuberance of Gilead, as well as the bard rocks of Judaea.\" And again, \"Lovely knolls and dells open out at every turn, gently rising to the wooded plateau above. Then we rise to higher ground and ride through noble forests of oak. Then for a mile or two through luxuriant green corn, or perhaps through a rich forest of scattered olive trees, left untended and uncared for, with perhaps patches of corn in the open glades\" ('Bible Places,' p. 322). The cedars of Lebanon, however diminished, still bear witness to the ancient fame of this splendid mountain district. A wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited. The comparison has a terrible significance when read in the light of De Vogue's and Freshfield's discoveries. For Gilead itself is full of ruined cities of massive stone architecture. \"It is no uncommon thing,\" says Mr. F.A. Eaton, \"to see these houses in a complete state of preservation, built of huge blocks of black basalt, with slabs of the same for the roof, twelve feet long, a foot and a half wide, and half a foot thick, and entrance doors also of basalt... great solid stones of the same material being used as lintels at the top and bottom\" (Speech at the meeting for setting on foot the survey of Eastern Palestine, November 30, 1880: Statement of Palestine Exploration Fund, January, 1880, p. 11). Cities which are not inhabited; not, indeed, the cities of Gilead of the time of Jeremiah, but constructed of materials which may reasonably be presumed to have been chiseled in a far more remote antiquity. (The date of the cities in their present state is subsequent to the Christian era.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will prepare; literally, I will consecrate; the Babylonians being instruments of the Divine vengeance (see on Jeremiah 6:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWeep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-12. - There is a fate worse than that of the dead Josiah. Weep not, in comparison, for him, but weep sore for him that goeth away (or rather, that is gone away). The king referred to is probably Jehoahaz, who, though two years younger than Jehoiakim (2 Kings 23:31; comp. 36), was preferred to him by the people on the death of Josiah. The counsel to \"weep sore\" for this royal exile was carried out, as Mr. Samuel Cox observes (and we have, perhaps, a specimen of the popular elegies upon him in Ezekiel 19:1-4): \"A young lion of royal strain, caught untimely, and chained and carried away captive, - this was how the people of Israel conceived of Shallum\" ('Biblical Expositions,' p. 120). The conjecture is incapable of proof; and Ezekiel, we know, was fond of imaginative elegies. But probably enough he was in harmony with popular feeling on this occasion. The identification of Shallum with Jehoahaz is confirmed by 1 Chronicles 3:15 (Shallum, the youngest son of Josiah); the name appears to have been changed on his accession to the throne, just as Eliakim was changed to Jehoiakim (2 Chronicles 36:4). There is, therefore, no occasion to suppose an ironical allusion to the short reign of Jehoahaz, which might be compared to that of the Israelitish king Shallum (somewhat as Jezebel addresses Jehu as \"O Zimri, murderer of his lord,\" 2 Kings 9:31). This view has the support of F. Junius (professor at Leyden, 1592), of Graf, and Rowland Williams; but why should not the Chronicler, though writing in the Persian period, have drawn here, as well as elsewhere in the genealogies, from ancient traditional sources? There is nothing in ver. 11 to suggest an allusion to the fate of the earlier Shallum.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Shallum, or Jehoahaz, in his short reign of three months, had no opportunity of distinguishing himself for good or for evil It was otherwise with Jehoiakim, whose eleven years were marked by the worst characteristics of idolatry and despotism. He \"had, besides, a passion for building splendid and costly houses; and as he esteemed his own position secure under the protection of a superior power, he did not scruple severely to oppress his helpless subjects, and wring from them as much money as possible\" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' 4:252; see 2 Kings 23:33-35). The building mania, to which Oriental sovereigns have always been prone, had seized upon Jehoiakim. The architecture of the original palace no longer, perhaps, suited the higher degree of civilization; the space was as confined as that of a Saxon mansion would have appeared to a Norman. That buildeth his house by unrighteousness; i.e., as the second half-verse explains, by not paying the workmen (comp. Habakkuk 2:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A wide house; literally, a house of extensions. Large chambers. The Hebrew specifies \"upper chambers \" - the principal rooms in ancient houses. Cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar; rather... his windows, roofing it with cedar. (This involves no change of letters, but a very slight rearrangement, and the alteration of one point; grammar gains greatly by the change.) \"Cutteth out\" is, literally, rend-eth; it is the word used in Jeremiah 4:30 of the apparent enlargement of the eyes by putting powdered antimony upon the eyelids. Windows are, as it were, the eyes of a building (Graf compares Ecclesiastes 12:3). Beams of cedar wood were used for the roof of the palace, as being the most costly and durable (comp. Isaiah 9:10). And painted - rather, and painting it - with vermilion; a taste derived from the Egyptians rather than the Babylonians, who seem to have had a difficulty in procuring red.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Shalt thou reign - rather, dost thou reign; i.e. dost thou prove thy royal qualities) - because thou closest thyself in cedar? The second part of the clause must at any rate be. altered. Some render, \"because thou viest (with thy forefathers) in cedar\" (i.e. in building cedar palaces). Hitzig would strike out \"in cedar,\" as having intruded from the preceding line (such a phenomenon meets us occasionally in the received Hebrew text), but this does not help us to a 'connected translation of the passage. Graf's rendering is grammatical, and not against usage; it is, \"Dost thou reign because thou art eager about cedar-wood?\" and yet the impression left on the mind is that there is some error in the text. The Septuagint finds a reference to one of Jehoiakim's predecessors, \"because thou viest with Ahaz\" (so the Vatican Codex), or, \"... with Ahab\" (so the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic or Friderico-Augustan). The latter king is celebrated in the Old Testament on account of his buildings, especially his ivory palace (2 Kings 22:39). The former was at any rate addicted to the imitation of foreign ways (2 Kings 16:11; 2 Kings 20:11). Did not thy father eat and drink? There was no call upon Jehoiakim to live the life of a Nazarite. \"Eating and drinking,\" i.e. enjoying the good things within his reach, was perfectly admissible (Ecclesiastes 2:24); indeed, the Old Testament view of life is remarkable for its healthy naturalness. There was, however, one peremptory condition, itself as much in accordance with nature as with the Law of God, that the rights of other men should be studiously regarded. Josiah \"ate and drank,\" but he also \"did judgment and justice,\" and so \"it was well with him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But thou, O Jehoiakim, art the opposite of thy father. For (not, But) thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness. \"Covetousness\" includes the ideas of injustice and violence (comp. Jeremiah 6:13; Jeremiah 8:10); hence the second half of the verse emphasizes the cruel tyranny which marked the internal policy of Jehoiakim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Josiah had been bitterly missed and universally lamented (2 Chronicles 35:25); and so, only perhaps with less heartiness in most cases, Jehoiakim's other predecessors (Jeremiah 34:5). The Babylonian kings, too, received the honors of public mourning, e.g. even the last of his race, who surrendered to Cyrus, according to the British Museum inscription translated by Mr. Pinches. Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! The Septuagint omits the latter part of this phrase, apparently because it seemed inappropriate to the death of Jehoiakim; but the parallelism requires a two-membered clause. According to Movers, the funeral procession is to be conceived of as formed of two parts, condoling with each other on having to share the same fate ('Die Phonizier,' 2. 248). Or perhaps mythology may supply a reason; it is possible that the formulae of public mourning were derived from the ceremonies of the Adonia; Adonis was an androgynous deity (Lenormant, 'Lettres assyriologiques,' 2:209), and might be lamented by his devotees as at once \"brother\" and \"sister.\" (For another view, see Sayco's edition of G. Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis,' p. 267). Ezekiel (Ezekiel 8:13) testifies to the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis, and the highest compliment a king could receive might be to be lamented in the same terms as the sun-god. Jeremiah does not approve this; he merely describes the popular custom. The recognition of the deeply rooted heathenism of the Jews before the Exile involves no disparagement to Old Testament religion; rather it increases the cogency of the argument for its supernatural origin. For how great was the contrast between Jeremiah and his semi-heathen countrymen! And yet Jeremiah's religion is the seed of the faith which overcame the world. Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! Lord is in the Hebrew adon (comp. Adonis and see above). His glory is against the parallelism; we should expect \"lady\" or \"queen.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Jehoiakim's miserable death, without even the honor of burial. The prediction is repeated in Jeremiah 36:30, where the statement is made in plain language. At first sight it appears to conflict with 2 Kings 24:6, \"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead;\" but it is only appearance, and when we remember that the complete formula for describing the natural death of a king of Judah is, \"slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David\" (1 Kings 14:31; 1 Kings 15:24; 1 Kings 22:50; 2 Kings 8:24; 2 Kings 15:7, 38; 2 Kings 16:20), and that the phrase, \"slept with his fathers,\" is used of Ahab, who fell on the field of battle (1 Kings 22:40), we are naturally led to the conjecture that Jehoiakim did not die a natural death, but fell in battle in some sally made by the besieged. Buried with the burial of an ass; i.e. cast out unburied. Beyond the gates; rather, far from the gates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - A new strophe begins here, relative to Jehoiachin, the son and successor of Jehoiakim. Go up to Lebanon, and cry. The people of Judah is addressed, personified as a woman (comp. Jeremiah 7:29). The penetrating character of the long-toned cry of an Arab has been mentioned by Dr. Thomson. In Isaiah 40:9 a similar command is given to Zion; but in what different circumstances! From the passages; rather, from Abarim. The range of Abarim - Nebo, from which Hoses surveyed the land of Israel, belonged to it (Deuteronomy 32:49) - completes the circle of mountain stations; Lebanon was in the north, Bashan in the northeast, Abarim in the southeast. All thy lovers; viz. the nations whom self-interest had combined against Nebuchadrezzar, and between whom and Judah negotiations had from time to time been entered into (Jeremiah 2:36; Jeremiah 27:3). \"Lovers\" (comp. Jeremiah 4:30; Jeremiah 30; Ezekiel 16:33, 37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - From thy youth; i.e. from the time that thou didst become a nation (comp. Jeremiah 2:2; Hosea 2:15). It is the Exodus which is referred to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Shall eat up all thy pastors. The verb is that connected with the participle rendered \"pastors;\" strictly, therefore, shall pasture upon all thy pastors. The wind referred to is doubtless the parching east wind, the symbol of calamity, which is actually called a \"sharp\" wind in Jeremiah 4:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - O inhabitant - rather, O inhabitress - of Lebanon. It is the people of Jerusalem which is meant; the \"Lebanon\" are the palaces of cedar-wood which together are called\" the house of the King of Judah\" (ver. 6). How gracious shalt thou be; rather, How wilt thou sigh!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Coniah. A shorter form of Jeconiah (1 Chronicles 3:1), found again in Jeremiah 37:1. Perhaps this was the name this king bore prior to his accession, after which it was certainly Jehoiachin; Jeremiah has already spoken of one king by his earlier name in ver. 11. The Divine speaker solemnly announces that though, as the representative of Israel's invisible King, Coniah were - or rather, be - the signet upon his right hand (a most valued jewel), yet would - or rather, will - he pluck him thence; i.e. depose him from his high dignity. The same figure is used in Haggai 2:23, \"I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, and make thee as a signet;\" and Ezekiel 28:12, where there is a well-attested reading, \"Thou (O King of Type) art a deftly made signet-ring.\" (For the fulfillment of the prediction in this verse, see 2 Kings 24:12, 15; Jeremiah 24:1; Jeremiah 29:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Cast thee out. The Hebrew is stronger - \"hurl thee\" (comp. Isaiah 22:17, Hebrew). And thy mother; i.e. the queen-mother Nehushta (comp. Jeremiah 29:2; 2 Kings 24:8). She seems to have been particularly influential (see introduction to Jeremiah 13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Is this man Coniah, etc.? The prophet's human feelings are stirred; he cannot withhold his sympathy from the sad fate of his king. What! he exclaims; is it possible that this Coniah is treated as a piece of ill-wrought pottery ware (comp. Jeremiah 18:4), and \"hurled\" into a strange land? He and his seed. These words have caused some difficulty, owing to the youth, of Jehoiachin. According to 2 Kings 24:8 he was only eighteen when he was carried captive, while 2 Chronicles 36:9 makes him still younger, only eight (Josiah's age on his accession). Hitzig thinks the latter number is to be preferred; his chief reasons are the prominence given to the queen-mother, and the fact that the length of Jehoiachin's reign is given with more precise accuracy in 2 Chronicles than in 2 Kings. It is true that the king's wives are mentioned in 2 Kings 24:15. But that he had wives may, according to Hitzig, have been inferred by the late compiler of Kings from the passage before us; or the \"wives\" may have been those of Jehoiachin's predecessor (comp. 2 Samuel 16:21). Graf's conjecture is, perhaps, the safest view of the case, whether we accept the number eighteen or the number eight; it is that the \"seed\" spoken of as born to Jehoiachin in his captivity, and is reckoned to him by anticipation. It should be mentioned, however, that the Septuagint omits \"he and his seed\" altogether.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - O earth, earth, earth.

Isaiah 4:3) as one who has no heirs. He may have children, but none of them shall succeed to his place in the community. This is all that the passage means; there is no discrepancy with history: how should there be, when Jeremiah himself has mentioned the posterity of Jehoiachin (ver. 28 and the latter part of this verse)? Yet the Septuagint thought it necessary to avoid the appearance of such a discrepancy by rendering, not \"childless,\" but \"one proscribed\" (ἐκκήρυκτον).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord God of Israel; strictly, Jehovah the God of Israel. This national title of Jehovah suggests, in such a connection, that the crime of the kings is nothing short of sacrilege. Ye have scattered, etc.; i.e. been the cause of their scattering, Have not visited them. \"To visit\" often, by a natural association of ideas, means \"to give attention to.\" By an equally natural association, it means \"to fall upon, to punish.\" Hence, in the next clause, I will visit upon you. We have the same combination of meanings in Zechariah 10:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Parallel passage, Ezekiel 34:12-15. I will gather the remnant;. For the ill usage of foreign oppressors has supplemented that of home tyrants, so that only a \"remnant\" is left. And they shall be fruitful and increase. The fertility of the Jewish race in modern times has been a frequent subject of observation, and supplies the best comment upon Jeremiah s prophecy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And I will set up shepherds; e.g. rulers, not necessarily kings (see on next verse). Which shall feed them. For the evil shepherds \"fed themselves, and fed not my flock\" (Ezekiel 34:8). And they shall fear no more. Ezekiel again contributes an essential feature to the description. The neglect of the shepherds left the flock exposed to the ravages of wild beasts (Ezekiel 34:8). Neither shall they be lacking. A speaking phrase. Too many of the sheep had fallen down precipices or been carried off by lions. Yet the context rather favors a slight and palaeographically natural emendation of Hitzig, \"Neither shall they be terrified.\" The Septuagint omits the word altogether, which favors the supposition that they read as Hitzig would read, for they are apt to condense by omitting synonyms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - (Comp. the parallel passage, Jeremiah 33:15, 16.) Verse 5. - Behold, the days come. The use of the analogous phrase, \"And it shall come to pass in that day,\" would lead us to suppose that this verse describes a fresh stage in the progress of events, as if the faithful shepherds (ver. 4) were to precede the \"righteous Branch\" (ver. 5). Such a view, however, is not very plausible, for the Messtab, according to prophecy, is to appear in the darkest of times. The prophet simply means to impress upon us the greatness of the revelation which he is about to communicate. I will raise unto David. The promised Messiah, then, is certainly to be of the family of David (comp. Isaiah 9:7; Isaiah 11:1; Micah 5:2). A righteous Branch; rather, a righteous Plant: the root means \"to bud, or sprout.\" This is the first time in which the title the Plant is unmistakably applied to the Messianic King (possibly, but less probably, to the Messianic kings). It indicates that this great personage stands in connection with the divinely ordained and ancient royal family, but that he is in some way unique, and far surpasses his human ancestors. He \"springs forth;\" therefore he is not a sort of meteoric appearance, without any natural home among men, but rather the blossom of the Jewish nation, the embodiment of its highest qualities. And yet there is something extraordinary about him, for it is needful that Jehovah himself should \"raise\" this Plant from the almost worn-out stock of David. Note that the word rendered here in the Authorized Version \"Branch\" is not the same as that in the parallel passage in Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). It is, however, the word employed in Isaiah 4:2, which is taken by many, especially the elder interpreters (but with very doubtful justice), to be a prophecy of the Messiah. It is also the word used by Zechariah (Zechariah 3:8; Zechariah 6:12), as a proper name of the Messiah, which is one strong reason for rejecting the view mentioned above that the word rendered \"the Branch,\" or \"the Plant,\" is to be taken collectively as equivalent to \"branches,\" or rather \"plants\" (the article is not expressed in the Hebrew). In short, this passage and the prophecies referred to in Jeremiah are exceptions to the general Old Testament usage of the Hebrew word (cemakh), which is elsewhere a collective term equivalent to \"plantation.\" It is true that in ver. 4 \"shepherds,\" in the plural, are spoken of, but there is no reason why this title should be confined to kings - it may as fairly be extended to the chief rulers under a king as the term \"king\" itself (see on Jeremiah 17:20); and true, further, that ill Jeremiah 33:17 a continuous succession is promised of Davidic heirs to the throne, but this is not decisive in favor of the collective meaning, any more than Isaiah's later prophecy that \"the [reigning Davidic] king shall reign in righteousness\" disproves the strictly Messianic reference of his earlier promise in Isaiah 11:1. All prophecy is conditional; there may have been moral reasons why a continuance of the Davidic dynasty was held out by Jeremiah at one time as a possible prospect. (It is, however, extremely probable that Jeremiah 33:14-26 is the work of some other inspired writer; see ad loc.) The thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel, which is so closely parallel to this section, appears to interpret the prophecy of a single Messianic king (Ezekiel 34:23). And a King shall reign; rather, and he shall reign as king; i.e. he shall be the realized ideal of an Israelitish king - a second David. And prosper; or, and deal wisely. There is the same doubt as to the rendering of the verb in Isaiah 52:13 a. The radical idea is that of wisdom, and the analogy of Isaiah 11:2 favors the alternative rendering here. Shall execute judgment; in contrast to the neglectful conduct of Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 22:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Israel shall dwell safely. In the parallel passage (Jeremiah 33:16) we read \"Jerusalem,\" and there can hardly be a doubt that \"Jerusalem\" ought to be restored here. This is not the-only instance in which, by mistake, the scribe has written \"Israel\" instead of \"Jerusalem\" (see Jeremiah 32:30, 32; Jeremiah 51:49; Zephaniah 3:14; Zechariah 12:1). In Zechariah 1:19 the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word, \"Jerusalem,\" after the wrong one, \"Israel,\" but without canceling the latter (Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' 1880, pp. 97-101). And this is his name whereby he shall be called. There is a various reading, which may be rendered either, whereby they shall call (him, or her), or, which they shall proclaim, supported by the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and a few manuscripts (St. Jerome, too, mentions this reading). There is also a more important difference among the commentators as to the person who was to bear the name. The older Christian interpreters contended with all their might for the view that the name belonged to the Messiah, partly on real philological grounds, partly with the illegitimate theological object of obtaining a proof-text for the orthodox doctrine of the person of the Messiah and (in the case of Protestant writers) of justification. It is much to the credit of Hengstenberg that he sets this object aside, and while maintaining the Messianic reference of the pronoun interprets the name with a single eye to the requirements of the context, \"He by whom and under whom Jehovah will be our righteousness.\" The objection is that in the parallel passage (Jeremiah 33:16) Jeremiah assigns the name \"Jehovah-Tsidkenu,\" not to the Messiah, but to Jerusalem. The prophet must be allowed to be his best interpreter, so that we must, it would seem, at any rate, reject the Messianic reference. But then how are we to explain the pronoun? It is right to refer the parallel pronoun in Jeremiah 33:16 to \"Jerusalem,\" because the pronoun there is feminine, and evidently refers to a city, but it is not natural in our passage to explain \"his name\" of \"Israel,\" seeing that the subject of the noun in the parallel line is, not Israel, but the Messiah. is the text here correct? A comparison of the parallel psalms Psalms 14 and Psalms 53, and of the corresponding chapters in Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, will show how easily errors made their way into duplicate copies of the same passage. Granting that we have such duplicate copies of this prophecy in Jeremiah, there can be no doubt which is the more original; the form of Jeremiah 23:6 has a difficulty from which Jeremiah 33:16 is free - a difficulty of interpretation and a difficulty also of grammar. For, as Ewald has already pointed out ('Hebrew Grammar,' § 249 b), the contracted suffix is very rarely attached to the simple imperfect, and the clear style in which this section is written justifies us in regarding any unusual form with suspicion. \"Israel\" thus was probably written by mistake for \"Jerusalem,\" and this error soon led to others - first, the omission of \"her,\" and then the prefixing of \"his name\" for clearness, and (on the part of the authors of the points) the mispointing of the verb (so as to include in the form the pronoun \"him\"). It is some confirmation of this view that there are several other passages in which the words \"Israel\" and \"Jerusalem\" appear to have been confounded (see preceding note). Read, therefore, as in Jeremiah 33:16, And this is the name wherewith she shall be called. THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS; Hebrew, Yahveh (Jehovah) Tsidkenu. The name is formed on the analogy of other symbolic names, such as El-elohe-Israel (Genesis 33:20), Jehovah-Nisei (Exodus 17:15 ), and especially Jehovah-Shammah (Ezekiel 48:35), also a name of Jerusalem. These names are, in fact, sentences; Jehovah-Shammah, for instance, means \"The Lord (is) there;\" and the name in the present verse, \"The Lord (is) our Righteousness\" (Hengstenberg's view mentioned above seems less natural). It is singular that Zedekiah's name should come so near to that announced by the prophet. But there is still a difference between them. Zedekiah must mean \"The Lord (is) righteousness,\" i.e. is ever faithful to his revealed principles of action. But Jehovah-Tsidkenu may be correctly paraphrased, \"The Lord is the author of our prosperity,\" or, more strictly, \"of the justification of our claims in the sight of our enemies\" (comp. Isaiah 45:24; Isaiah 50:8; Isaiah 54:17; Isaiah 58:8; Isaiah 62:1, 2). Similar applications of forensic language are familiar, e.g. \"When they speak with their enemies in the gate\" (Psalm 127:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - This is another of Jeremiah's repetitions (see Jeremiah 16:14, 15). Either the Septuagint translator or the copyist of the Hebrew manuscript which he used appears to have thought that the passage might, therefore, be dispensed with. In the Septuagint it is placed at the end of the chapter (being possibly supplied from another Hebrew manuscript), and the form given in this version to the close of ver. 6 (Ἰωσεδὲκ ἐν τοῖς προφηταῖς, combining the opening words of ver. 9) shows that ver. 9 followed immediately upon ver. 6 in the Hebrew manuscript.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-40. - These verses form a complete prophecy, the title of which Jeremiah himself supplies in the words, \"Concerning the (false) prophets\" (see below); comp. Jeremiah 46:2; Jeremiah 48:1; Jeremiah 49:1, 7, 23, 28. It is true the rendering of the Authorized Version (ver. 9), Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets, is not purely arbitrary; it is favored by the exegetical tradition represented by the Hebrew accents. But it is not probable that two entirely different causes should be given for the prophet's deep emotion (see the latter part of the verse). Besides, \"breaking of the heart\" is nowhere a sign of anger (as Authorized Version would suggest), but either of grief (see on Jeremiah 8:20, or, as the context implies here, physical disturbance at the solemn message of Jehovah (comp. Jeremiah 6:11; Jeremiah 20:9). All my bones shake. It is a very uncommon verb, occurring only twice elsewhere (Genesis 1:2; Deuteronomy 32:11, in Piel). The words of his holiness; co, his words of holiness; i.e. his holy words, the words of the Holy One on the unholy doings of the false prophets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The land is full of adulterers. The false prophets connive at flagrant immoralities, one of which is mentioned as a typical sin. As to the nature of the adultery, see note on Jeremiah 5:7. Because of swearing; rather, because of the curse; the curse, namely, with which God punishes the guilty earth (comp. Zechariah 5:3; Daniel 9:11; and especially Isaiah 24:6, where in the original there is a paronomasia very similar to that here). The land mourneth; a figurative expression, suggested partly by the assonance of the word for \"curse.\" Drought is what is meant (comp. Jeremiah 12:4; Jeremiah 14:1, 2). The pleasant places of the wilderness; rather, the pastures of the prairie-land (\"wilderness\" suggests ideas very alien to the context). Their course; literally, their running (comp. Jeremiah 8:6). The subject is \"the inhabitants of the land.\" Their force is not right; rather, their might (or, heroism) is untruth. They are \"mighty men\" only in telling untruths (comp. Jeremiah 9:3; Isaiah 5:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Both prophet and priest are profane; i.e. are unholy, disobeying the Divine commands (see on Jeremiah 5:7). The same two important classes specified as in Jeremiah 6:13. Yea, in my house, etc. Evidently some sin specially incongruous with its locality is referred to, either idolatry (comp. Jeremiah 7:30) or the totemistic worship of figures of animals (Ezekiel 8:10, 11). Comp. note on Jeremiah 5:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Their way shall be unto them as slippery ways, etc.; rather, slippery places. The passage has a manifest affinity with Psalm 35:6 (in one of the Jeremiahizing psalms; see on Jeremiah 18:19, 20). They shall be driven on; or, as Ewald, taking over the last word of the preceding clause, they shall be thrust into the darkness. This involves a reminiscence, probable enough, of Isaiah 8:22 b. It is against the accentual tradition, but improves the rhythmical derision of the verse. If we ask who \"thrusts\" them, Psalm 35:5 supplies the answer - it is not merely external circumstances, but \"the Angel of Jehovah,\" i.e. Jehovah himself. As Bishop Hall says, \"God wounds us by many instruments, but with one hand.\" I will bring evil upon them, etc. Favorite expressions of Jeremiah (comp. Jeremiah 11:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - The prophets of Samaria were no doubt guilty enough, but their offences dwindled by the side of the \"horrible\" transgressions of those of the southern kingdom. The prophet apparently means, not only that the former, having fewer spiritual advantages, were less responsible than the latter, but also that they had not violated the moral code so conspicuously. Verse 13. - I have seen folly; rather, absurdity or unseemliness; literally, that which is unsavory (comp. Job 6:6). The word occurs with a similar reference to Jehovah in Job 1:22; Job 24:12. To \"prophesy by Baal\" was \"absurd,\" \"unseemly,\" because Baal was a \"non-entity\" (Isaiah's word for an idol). In Baal; rather, by, or by means of, Baal (see on Jeremiah 2:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I have seen also, etc.; rather, But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen. Horrible; as in Jeremiah 5:30. They commit adultery, etc.; literally, the committing adultery and the walking in lies - a much more forcible way of putting it. They are all of them; rather, They have become all of them; vie. either the prophets or the people in general. The inhabitants thereof; viz. of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - On the punishment here threatened, see note on Jeremiah 9:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-22. - A warning addressed to the people against the false prophecies (comp. Ezekiel 13.). Verse 16. - They make you vain; i.e. fill you with vain imaginations. A similar phrase occurs in Jeremiah 2:5, on which see note. A vision of their own heart; the heart being the center of the intellectual as well as of the moral life, according to the Hebrew conception.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said. The Septuagint and the Syriac render the same text (the consonants are alone the text) with different vowels, thus: \"Unto those who despise the word of the Lord.\" In favor of this it may be urged that the phrase, \"The Lord hath said,\" is nowhere else used in this abrupt way to introduce a real or supposed revelation, and Hitzig and Graf accordingly accept it. Ye shall have peace; as Jeremiah 6:14. After the imagination; rather, in the stubbornness (see on Jeremiah 3:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord; rather, in the council. This verse is connected with ver. 16; it gives the reason why the false prophets were not to be listened to. None of them had been admitted to the secret council of the Lord; the interrogation is here a form of denial. \"To stand in the council\" is not the same as \"to sit\" (Psalm 1:1); the latter phrase implies taking an active part in the consultations. It is specially applicable to the true prophets, according to ver. 22, and this, as we gather from other passages, m a twofold sense. Sometimes the prophets had visions, in which their inner eye was granted a sight of Jehovah in consultation with his trusted servants (Isaiah 6:1, comp. 8; 1 Kings 22:19); and the words of Eliphaz, \"Weft thou listening in the council of God?\" (Job 15:8), appear to be descriptive of a similar experience. But the phrase may also be used in a wider sense of entirely unecstatic revelations. Amos says (Amos 3:7), \"Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret counsel unto his servants the prophets; ' and a psalmist extends the term \"secret counsel\" to the communion which God grants to the pious in general (Psalm 25:14; comp. Proverbs 3:32). Thus there is no hard and-fast line between the experiences of the prophets and those of humbler believers. In so far as the latter are \"disciples of Jehovah\" (Isaiah 54:13), they too may be truly said to \"stand,\" at least in the doorway, \"in the council of Jehovah;\" just as a well-known collect inherited from the Latin Church beseeches that \"by God's holy inspiration we may think those things that he good.\" Who hath marked his word? A Jewish tradition, represented by the marginal notes in the Hebrew Bible, has taken offence at this variation in the expression, and would correct the reading to \"my word.\" But such changes of person are of frequent occurrence, and we know that the prophets were thoroughly assured that the word which they spoke was not theirs, but that of him who sent them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - These two verses seem to be connected with ver. 17. The false prophets say, \"Ye shall have peace.\" How different the message of the true! (A duplicate of these verses occurs in Jeremiah 30:23, 24.) Verse 19. - A whirlwind of the Lord, etc.; rather, A storm of the Lord, even fury, is gone forth, and a whirling storm - upon the head of the wicked shall it whirl. The hurricane has already broken out; it will soon reach Jerusalem. This seems to be the force of Jeremiah's expressive figure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The anger of the Lord. The prophet's interpretation of the image. It is the judicial anger of Jehovah, personified as Divine manifestations so often are (hence \"shall not return\"). The form of the verse reminds us of Isaiah 55:11. In the latter days; rather, in future days, as Dr. Henderson rightly renders. It seems better to restrict the term \"latter days\" to the Messianic period (\"the coming age,\" Matthew 12:32), to which, in fact, it is often applied (e.g. Isaiah 2:2; Hosea 3:5). The phrase in itself simply means \"in the sequel of the days,\" i.e. in the future; its Messianic reference, when this exists, is inferred solely from the context. In the passage before us, and in Deuteronomy 4:30, 30:29, there can be no intention of pointing to the Messianic age. Precisely the same phrase occurs in an Assyrian inscription, where its meaning is clear from the context (aria akhrat yumi irib, \"For a sequel of days - i.e., for a future time - I deposited\"). In the present case it is no distant period to which the prophet refers, for he continues, Ye shall consider it, etc., or rather, ye shall understand it clearly, viz. that the calamities which will have come upon you are the Divine judgment upon your sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - In vers. 17-20 Jeremiah has shown that these cannot be true prophets, because their message is diametrically opposed to the true revelation. He now proves it from the absence of any moral effect from their preaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAm I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-32. - Jehovah has observed and will punish the false pretensions of the prophets. Verses 23, 24. - Am I a God at hand, etc.? (\"At hand\" equivalent to \"near.\") Eliphaz may again assist us with an illustration. \"And thou sayest \" - he is expostulating with Job - \"What doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; yea, he walketh upon the vault of heaven\" (Job 22:13, 14). It might seem, from the preponderance of the false prophets ever the true, as if Jehovah were unaware of the mischief. Not so; Jehovah is omnipresent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I have dreamed. Jeremiah mentions it as one of the marks of a false prophet that he appealed to his dreams (comp. Jeremiah 29:8); true prophecy contented itself with less ambiguous media of communication with the unseen world. It may be objected that Abraham (Genesis 15:12), at any rate, and Abimelech (Genesis 20:3) received Divine revelations in dreams; but these were not officially prophets. Nathan and the contemporaries of the author of Job had messages from God by night, but these are called, not dreams, but visions (2 Samuel 7:14, comp. 17; Job 4:13). Deuteronomy (and this is one of its striking points of agreement with Jeremiah) expressly describes a false prophet as \"a dreamer of dreams\" (Deuteronomy 13:1; comp. 1 Samuel 28:6). Two passages in the Old Testament seem inconsistent with this discouragement of dreams as a medium of revelation - Numbers 12:6, where the Lord is said to make himself known to prophets by visions and dreams, and Joel 2:28, where the prophetic dreams of the old men are one of the features of a Messianic description; but it is noteworthy that the first of these refers to the primitive period of Israel's history, and the second to the distant Messianic age. In its classical period prophecy kept itself sedulously aloof from a field on which it had such compromising companionship (comp. Ecclesiastes 5:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - How long shall this be in the heart, etc.? i.e. how long shall this be their purpose, viz. to prophesy lies? But this rendering leaves out of account a second interrogative which in the Hebrew follows \"how long.\" It is better to translate this difficult passage, with De Dieu and many moderns, thus: \"How long (quousque durabit haec ipsorum impudentia)? Is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and the prophets of the deceit of their own heart; are they thinking (I say) to cause my people to forget,\" etc.? On this view, ver. 27 resumes the question interrupted in ver. 26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Every man to his neighbor. Not merely one prophet to another prophet, for it is \"my people\" whom they cause to forget my Name (comp. ver. 32), but the prophet to his fellow man. Have forgotten my name for Baal; or, forgot my name through Baal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Let him tell a dream; rather, let him tell it as a dream; let him tell his dreams, if he will, but not intermix them with Divine revelations. Jeremiah, then, does not deny that there is a measure of truth in what these prophets say; he only demands a distinct declaration that their dreams are but dreams, and not equal in authority to the Divine word. For, as he continues, What is the chaff to the wheat? What right have you to mix the worthless chaff with the pure, winnowed grain? How, he implies, can such an adulterated message produce the designed effect of a prophetic revelation? (St. Paul has a somewhat similar figure, 1 Corinthians 3:10-13.) So Naegelsbach. Keil, however, denies that there is any thought of an adulteration of the Divine word by the \"false prophets.\" According to him, the question in this verse is simply meant to emphasize the contrast between the false, dream-born prophecy of Jeremiah's opponents and the true revelations. How can the false prophecy pretend to be the true? They are as different as chaff and wheat. Both views are admissible. Naegelsbach introduces a new element by suggesting the intermixture of false and true in the utterances of the \"false prophets;\" but his view is not inconsistent with what the prophet has stated before, and it is favored by ver. 30 and by the command, Let him speak my word faithfully; i.e. in its genuine form; comp. Jeremiah 2:21, \"A faithful or trustworthy [i.e. a genuine] seed;\" also, for the general sense, 2 Corinthians 2:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Is not my word like as a fire? As in vers. 19, 20, so here, the prophet contrasts the message of the false prophets with that of the true. The former flatter their hearers with promises of peace; the latter speak a stern but potent word, which burns like a fire, and crushes like a hammer. Observe, the prophet does not define the activity of the fire as he does that of the hammer; for the fire has a twofold effect - protection to God's friends and destruction to his enemies. On the figure of the hammer, comp. Jeremiah 1:23; 51:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-32. - The punishment solemnly introduced by a three times repeated, Behold, I am against, etc., corresponding to three several features of the conduct of the false prophets. First we are told that the prophets steal my words every one from his neighbor. The latter part of the phrase reminds us of ver. 27, but the neighbor in this case must mean, at any rate primarily, a fellow-prophet, one who has really received a revelation at first-hand from Jehovah. The \"false prophets,\" not trusting to their \"dreams\" alone, listen greedily to the discourses of men like Jeremiah, not with a view to spiritual profit, but to making their own utterances more effective. We must remember that they lived by their prophesying (Micah 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - That use their tongues; literally, that take their tongue, like a workman's tool - as if prophecy could be turned out to order. And say, He saith. The word rendered \"he saith\" is one which the prophets habitually used to affirm the revealed character of their teaching. It is the participle of the verb rendered \"say.\" Adopting a Miltonic verb, we might render, and oracle oracles.\" The \"false prophets\" adopt the same forms as the true; but they are to them only forms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - That prophesy false dreams (see on ver. 25). By their lightness. The word is an uncommon one, and implies arrogance or boastfulness (comp. Zephaniah 3:4); the root means \"to bubble over.\" Therefore they shall not profit; rather, and they cannot profit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-40. - The abuse of a consecrated phrase. The prophets were accustomed to apply the term massa to their prophetic declarations in the sense of \"oracle,\" or \"utterance\" - a sense derived from the use of the cognate verb for \"to lift up the voice,\" i.e. to pronounce clearly and distinctly. But the word massa was also in common use for \"load, burden,\" and hence the \"false prophets\" applied the term derisively to Jeremiah's discourses. \"Rightly does he call his word a massa; it is not merely a solemn utterance, but a heavy burden; as De Wette puts it, not merely a Weissagung, but a Wehsagung. The passage is important as indicating the sense in which the true prophets understood the term. It should be added that the term mused is prefixed to at least four Biblical passages which, not being of threatening import, do not admit of being entitled \"burdens\" (Zechariah 9:1; Zechariah 12:1; Proverbs 30:1; Proverbs 31:1; comp. Lamentations 2:14). How remarkable is the line adopted by Jeremiah 1 He simply abandons the use Of the term massa, consecrated as it was by the practice of inspired men! Better to adopt a new phrase, than to run the risk of misunderstanding or, even worse, profanity. Verse 33. - What burden? etc. The Hebrew text, as usually read, is extremely difficult; the Authorized Version is entirely unjustifiable. It is just possible to explain, with Ewald, \"As to this question, What is the burden? the true meaning of the word is that,\" etc. But how harsh and artificial! By a change in the grouping of the consonants (which alone constitute the text), we may read, Ye are the burden. So the Septuagint, Vulgate, Hitzig, Graf, Payne Smith. We must in this case continue, and I will cast you off, as the same verb is to be rendered in Jeremiah 7:29; Jeremiah 12:7. Instead of carrying you with the long-suffering of a father (Deuteronomy 1:31; Isaiah 46:3, 4; Isaiah 63:9; Psalm 28:9), I will east you off as a troublesome load (Isaiah 1:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - What hath the Lord answered? i.e. a simpler phraseology is to be used, Jehovah hath answered, saying, or, Jehovah hath spoken, according as a definite question had been put before the prophet or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah23:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And the burden of the Lord, etc.; i.e. ye shall no longer use the word massa at all. Every man's word shall be his burden; rather, the burden to every man shall be his word; i.e. his derisive use of the word massa shall be a burden which shall crush him to the ground.

Jeremiah 1:15, note). And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. This is the rendering of the Targum, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, and corresponds with the reading of a few extant manuscripts. The received text, however, reads, \"and unto Nebuchadnezzar,\" etc. Neither reading is satisfactory. The latter one is intolerably harsh; the former makes Nebuchadnezzar a mere adjunct of the tribes of the north. In the other passages, moreover, where this king is solemnly entitled \"my servant,\" the clause is the most prominent one in the sentence (see Jeremiah 27:6; Jeremiah 43:10). The words in question have a sort of family resemblance to the glosses which meet us occasionally both in the form of the Hebrew text represented by the Massoretic recension, and those by the principal ancient versions. The words are omitted by the Septuagint. My servant. Generally to be a \"servant\" of Jehovah or of any supposed deity is to be a worshipper. Thus Daniel is called by Darius, \"servant of the living God\" (Daniel 6:20), and thus Abdallah, \"servant of Allah,\" has become a favorite surname of the followers of Mohammed. In the Book of Jeremiah itself (Jeremiah 30:10; Jeremiah 46:27, 28), and in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:25), \"my servant\" is the form in which Jehovah addresses his chosen people; and in the second part of Isaiah the suffering Messiah is so styled. Here, however, a foreign king is thus entitled. How is this to be explained? Cyrus, no doubt, in Isaiah 44:28, 45:1, is called \"my shepherd\" and \"my anointed one;\" but then Cyrus, in the view of the prophet, was a genuine though unconscious worshipper of the true God (Isaiah 41:25), whereas Nebuchadnezzar was known to be a polytheist and an idolater. We must, therefore, take \"servant\" to be applied to Nebuchadnezzar in a lower sense than to the other bearers of the title. The Hebrew 'ebbed, in fact, may be either \"slave\" in something approaching to the terrible modern sense, or in the sense in which Eliezer was one (i.e. little less than a son, and a possible heir, Genesis 24:2; Galatians 4:1), and which is still in full force in Arabia. An astonishment (see on Jeremiah 2:11). An hissing (comp. Jeremiah 18:16; Jeremiah 19:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The sound of the millstones. Modern travel enables us (so conservative is the East) to realize the full force of this image. The hand-mill is composed of two stones. As a rule, \"two women\" (comp. Matthew 24:41) sit at it facing each other; both have hold of the handle by which the upper is turned round on the 'nether' millstone. The one whose right hand is disengaged throws in the grain as occasion requires, through the hole in the upper stone\" (Dr. Thomson). \"The labor,\" remarks Dr. Robinson, \"is evidently hard; and the grating sound of the mill is heard at a distance, indicating (like our coffee-mills) the presence of a family and of household life\" ('Biblical Researches,' 2:181). Add to this the light of the candle (or rather, lamp), and we have two of the most universally characteristic signs of domestic life. No family could dispense with the hand-mill, and, as the sermon on the mount implies, the poorest household had its \"lamp\" (Matthew 5:15 - the poverty of the family is indicated by the various uses to which the lamp-stand was applied). Comp. this verse with the imitation in Revelation 18:22, 23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. Widely different opinions are held as to the meaning of this prophecy. The most probable view is that \"seventy\" is an indefinite or round number (as in Isaiah 23:17), equivalent to \"a very long time.\" This is supported by the analogy of Jeremiah 27:7, where the captivity is announced as lasting through the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar, his son, and his grandson - a statement evidently vague and indefinite (see ad loc.), and in any case not answering to a period of seventy years. Besides, we find the \"seventy years\" again in Jeremiah 29:10, a passage written probably eleven years later. Others think the number is to be taken literally, and it is certainly true that from B.C. 606, the fourth year of Jehoiakim, to the fall of Babylon, B.C. 539, sixty-seven years elapsed. But is it desirable to press this against the internal evidence that Jeremiah himself took the number indefinitely?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-29. - The judgment upon Judah and the nations. Verse 12. - Perpetual desolations. Thus, too, we read in Isaiah 13:20, that Babylon \"shall never be inhabited.\" There is a dispute between Dr. Keith and Dr. Kay on the one side, and rationalistic commentators (e.g. Kuenen) on the other, whether these prophecies have received a circumstantial fulfillment. The truth is that authorities are not entirely agreed on the area covered by the site of Babylon. General Chesney remarks that, so far from being uninhabited, \"A town of considerable population, villages, date groves, and gardens, are found still on the very site of ancient Babylon\" (extracts from a private letter in B. W. Newton's 'Babylon: its Revival and Final Desolation,' pp. 38-42). Similarly M. Menant, a veteran French Assyriologist, remarks that \"Hillah, according to M. Oppert, was a quarter of Babylon, probably that which was inhabited by the working population, without the precincts of the royal palaces. Numberless traces of ancient habitations indicate this origin of the modern town\" ('Babylone,' p. 177). Mr. George Smith, however, in his 'Assyrian Discoveries,' simply states that, \"A little to the south rose the town of Hillah,\" apparently assuming (what is impossible to prove, as the walls of Babylon have not yet been discovered) that Hillah lay just outside the city enclosure. But even he adds that it was \"built with the bricks found in the old capital,\" which is, strictly speaking, inconsistent with the absolute abandonment of the site of Babylon implied in Isaiah 13:20-22. The dispute is an unfortunate one, as it tacitly implies that circumstantial fulfillments are necessary to the veracity of prophecy. The truth seems to lie in the mean between two opposing views. As a rule, the details of a prophetic description cannot be pressed; they are mainly imaginative elaborations of a great central truth or fact. Occasionally, however, regarding the prophecies in the light of gospel times, it is almost impossible not to observe that \"the Spirit of Christ which was in\" the prophets (1 Peter 1:11) has overruled their expressions, so that they correspond more closely to facts than could have been reasonably anticipated. Such superabundant favors to believers in inspiration occur repeatedly in the prophecies respecting Christ. They may, of course, occur elsewhere for a sufficient reason, but we have no right to be surprised if we do not meet with them. The general truth of the prophecy is that the empire of Babylon shall fall forever. As Dr. Payne Smith remarks, it was practically the work of one man (Nebuchadnezzar), and after his death it only lasted for a few years, during which its history is a series of murders and usurpations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And I will bring, etc. Clearly this verse cannot have formed part of the original prophecy, but must have been added whenever the collection of prophecies against foreign nations finally assumed its present form (see introduction on Jeremiah 50, 51.). It should be mentioned that the Septuagint separates the last clause of the verse, \"that which Jeremiah prophesied,\" etc., and makes it the heading of the group of prophecies against the nations, which in the Hebrew Bible stand at the end of Jeremiah's prophecies, but which, beginning with \"Elam,\" the Alexandrian Version inserts at this point.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For many nations... shall serve themselves of them else; i.e. put forced labor upon them also. The same phrase is used of the conduct of the Egyptians to the Israelites (Exodus 1:14). Of them also; and \"also\" suggests that the calamity of the Chaldeans is a retribution (comp. Isaiah 66:4), as the next clause, in harmony with Jeremiah 50:29, 51:24, emphatically declares.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For thus saith, etc. Out of this verse and the following, to the end of the chapter, the Septuagint makes the thirty-second chapter, Jeremiah 25. being completed by the prophecy against Elam (Jeremiah 49:34-39). The symbolic act which the prophet is directed to perform is mentioned in order to explain the word of threatening just uttered. So, at least, we must understand it, if we accept the arrangement of the Hebrew text. But the connection is certainly improved if we follow Graf, and omit vers. 11b-14; ver. 15 thus becomes an explanation of the threat against Judah and the other nations in vers. 9-11a. The wine, up of this fury; or, this wine-cup of fury. The wine with which the cup is filled is the wrath of God. The figure is not an infrequent one with the prophets and the psalmists (comp. Jeremiah 49:12; Jeremiah 51:7; Isaiah 51:17, 22; Ezekiel 23:31-34; Habakkuk 1:16; Psalm 60:3; Psalm 75:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And be moved, and be mad; rather, and reel to and fro, and behave themselves madly. The inspired writers do not scruple to ascribe all phenomena, the \"bad\" as well as the \"good,\" to a Divine operation. \"Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?\" (Amos 3:6). \"An evil spirit from Elohim came upon Saul, and he became frenzied\" (1 Samuel 18:10; see also Isaiah 19:14; Isaiah 29:10; 1 Kings 22:19-23, and especially the very remarkable prologue of the Book of Job). To understand this form of expression, we must remember the strength of the reaction experienced by the prophets against the polytheism of the surrounding nations. It was not open to them to account for the existence of evil by ascribing it to the activity of various divinities; they knew Jehovah to be the sole cause in the universe. To us, \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\" such a doctrine occasions \"great searchings of heart,\" and is sometimes a sore trial of our faith. But the prophets were not logicians, and their faith, compared to ours, was as an oak tree to a sapling; hence they can generally (see, however, Isaiah 63:17) express the truth of the universal causation of Jehovah with perfect tranquility. Because of the sword. Here Jeremiah deserts the figure of the Cup, and, as most commentators think, uses the language of fact. It is not, however, certain that \"the sword\" means that of God's human instruments; Jehovah himself has a sword (Jeremiah 46:10; Jeremiah 47:6; Jeremiah 50:35-38; Isaiah 27:1; Isaiah 34:5; and elsewhere), just as he has a hand (Isaiah 8:11; Isaiah 59:1) and an arm (Isaiah 40:10; Isaiah 53:1). All these belong to a group of childlike symbolic expressions for the manifestation of the Deity. Jehovah's \"sword\" is described more fully in Genesis 3:24; it \"turns hither and thither,\" like the lightning - a striking figure of the completeness with which God performs his work of vengeance (see also on ver. 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Then took I the cup... and made all the nations to drink. It is too pro-sale to suppose either that Jeremiah made a journey to \"all the nations,\" or that he actually went through the form of presenting the cup to the ambassadors who (it is conjectured, comp. Jeremiah 27:3b) had come to Jerusalem to take measures against the common foe (so J. D. Michaelis). But the supposition arises (as Keil has well observed) out of an imperfect comprehension of the figure. It is not a cup with wine which the prophet receives from Jehovah, but a wine-cup filled with the wine of God's fury, which wine (one may add) is no more a literal wine than the \"sword of Jehovah\" is a literal sword. The \"making all the nations to drink\" is simply a way of expressing the prophet's firm faith that the word of Jehovah will not \"return unto him void \" - that a prophecy once uttered must fulfill itself; and \"sent me,\" in the last clause, merely means \"entrusted me with a message\" (comp. Proverbs 26:6). For the fulfillment of this detailed prediction, see on Jeremiah 46-51.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The kings thereof (see on Jeremiah 19:3). As it is this day. As to the meaning of this phrase, see on Jeremiah 11:5. The words evidently presuppose that the prediction has already been fulfilled (comp. Jeremiah 44:6, 23); consequently, they cannot have stood here in the original draft of the prophecy. An early editor, or even Jeremiah himself, must have inserted them. They are omitted in the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Pharaoh king of Egypt. After leaving Judah and Jerusalem, the prophet turns to the far south - to Egypt; then he ascends to the south-east (Uz), and the south-west (the Philistines); thence he passes to the east (Edom, Moab, Ammon); and thence to the west of the Holy Land (Phoenicia). This suggests the maritime lands \"beyond the sea\" (including especially Cyprus); a sudden transition brings the prophet to the Arabian tribes (Dedan, etc.), from whence he passes by the road of the northeast (Elam, Media) to the indefinitely distant north. Last of all, in solitary grandeur or infamy, Babylon is mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The mingled people; Septuagint, καὶ πάντας τοὺς συμμίκτους: Vulgate, et universes generaliter. The Hebrew 'erebh probably means, not \"mingled [i.e. 'motley'] people,\" as the Authorized Version, but \"foreign people,\" i.e. a body of men belonging to some particular nation intermixed or interspersed among those belonging to another. This explanation will account for the use of the word in all the passages in which it occurs (here and in ver. 24; also Exodus 12:38; Nehemiah 13:3; 1 Kings 10:15; Jeremiah 1:37; Ezekiel 30:5; and perhaps 2 Chronicles 9:14). The context here and in 1 Kings 10:15 seems to imply that the name was given especially to the tribes (probably Bedawin tribes) on the frontier of Judah towards the desert, though in Ezekiel 30:5 it is evidently applied to a people which in some sense belonged to Egypt. In Exodus 12:38 it may be doubted whether the phrase is used from the point of view of Egypt or of the Israelites; in Jeremiah 50:37 it is used of the foreigners in Babylon in 2 Chronicles 9:14 the Massoretic critics have pointed the consonants of the text wrongly ('arabh, Arabia, instead of 'erebh), but without injury to the sense; the Vulgate and Syriac have done the same in 1 Kings 10:15. The notion that the word means ' auxiliary troops\" arises (as Thenius on 1 Kings 10:15 remarks) from the free rendering of the Targum at 1 Kings 10:15 and Jeremiah 50:37. Uz. The land associated with the name of Job, and probably east or south-east of Palestine, and adjacent to the Edomites of Mount Seir (Lamentations 4:21). Of the Philistines. Observe, Gath is alone omitted of the five Philistine towns (Joshua 13:3; 1 Samuel 6:17). It had been reduced to complete insignificance (Amos 6:2), through Uzziah's having \"broken down\" its walls (2 Chronicles 26:6), and is equally passed over in Amos (Amos 1:6-8), Zephaniah (Zephaniah 2:4), and Zechariah (Zechariah 9:5, 6). Azzah; i.e. Gaza, the Septuagint form (the G representing the initial ayin), which is everywhere else adopted by the Authorized Version. The remnant of Ashdod. A significant phrase, which can be explained from Herodotus (2:157): For twenty-nine years Psamnutichus \"pressed the siege of Azotus without intermission.\" We can imagine that he would not be disposed to lenient dealings with the town upon its capture.

Under the names of the two leading cities, the prophet includes the various dependent Phoenician commonwealths. Hence the plural \"kings.\" The isles. The Hebrew has the singular, \"the isle,\" or rather, \"the coast-laud\" (more strictly, the region), i.e. perhaps either Tartessus in Spain, or Cyprus (which Esarhaddon describes as \"lying in the midst of the sea,\" and as having two kings, 'Records of the Past,' 3:108).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Dedan, and Tema, and Buz.

Elihu, Job's youngest friend, was of Bus (Job 32:2).

Not \"Arabia\" in our sense (which is never found in the Old Testament), but the desert region to the east and south-east of Palestine, occupied by nomad or \"Ishmaelitish\" tribes. The mingled people; rather, the intermingled people (see on ver. 20); i.e. probably in this passage populations of a different race interspersed among the Aramaic tribes to which most of the inhabitants of the desert belonged.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Zimri. The Zimri were a people to the northeast of Assyria, against whom various Assyrian kings waged war (Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, 1878, pp. 13, 15, 34; 'Records of the Past,' 5:41). Whether they axe to be connected with the Zimran of Genesis 25:2 seems doubtful; their locality hardly suits. Elam. Elam, one of the most ancient monarchies in the world (comp. Genesis 14.), is again coupled with Media in Isaiah 21:2. It was a region on the east of the lower Tigris, bounded westward by Babylonia, northward by Assyria and Media, southward by the Persian Gulf. To say that it is put either here or anywhere else in the Old Testament for the whole of Persia seems a mistake, as the Persians were hardly known before the time of Cyrus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The kings of the north.

The Hebrew has, \"the near and the far, the one to the other;\" i.e. whether near or far in relation to each other, for of course with regard to Judah they were all \"the far north.\" All the kingdoms of the world, etc. This is far from being the only instance in which a special judgment upon a nation or nations is apparently identified with a great final judgment upon the world (see Isaiah 2:12; Isaiah 3:13; Isaiah 13:9; Isaiah 24:1-12). The truth is that every great serf-manifestation of the Divine Governor of the world is a fresh act in that great drama of which the universal judgment will be the close. Hence the prophets, whose perspective was necessarily limited, seeing the cud but not all that was to precede it, speak as if the end were nearer at hand than it really was. The king of Sheshach, etc. This clause, however, is omitted in the Septuagint, and is too manifestly the insertion of an unwise copyist or editor. For, though perfectly true that Babylon was to suffer punishment afterwards, it is most inappropriate to mention it here at the end of a list of the nations which Babylon itself was to punish. \"Sheshach,\" it should be explained, is the form assumed by the word \"Babylon\" in the cypher called Athbash (A = T, B = SH, etc.). It happens to convey a very appropriate meaning, viz. \"humiliation\" (comp. Isaiah 47:1). A similar instance of cypher allegory occurs in Jeremiah 51:1. \"Sheshach\" occurs again in Jeremiah 51:41, where, however, it is omitted by the Septuagint. [Dr. Lauth, of Munich, thinks that Sheshach is equivalent to Sisku, the name of a district in Babylonia; but the reading Sisku is uncertain. (See Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, 1881, p. 48.)]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Therefore thou shalt say, etc.; rather, And thou shalt say, etc. This verse is probably a continuation of vers. 16,17, vers. 18-26 being apparently inserted by an afterthought. The message given to Jeremiah to deliver is that the judgment is both overpoweringly complete and irreversible. If God's own people has not been spared, how should any other escape (comp. Jeremiah 49:12)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - I will call for a sword. It is probably that awful sword referred to in ver. 16 (see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-38. - The judgment upon the world. Verse 30. - Therefore prophesy thou, etc. Babylon, like the smaller kingdoms which it absorbed, has fallen, and nothing remains (for nothing had been revealed to the prophet concerning an interval to elapse previously) but to picture the great assize from which no flesh should be exempt. As the lion suddenly bursts, roaring, from his lair, so Jehovah, no longer the \"good Shepherd,\" shall roar from on high (comp. Amos 1:2; Joel 3:16) even upon his habitation, or rather, against his pasture, where his flock (Jeremiah 23:1) has been feeding so securely. He shall give a shout. It is the technical term used at once for the vintage-shout and for the battle-cry. In Isaiah 16:9, 10, there is a beautiful allusion to this double meaning, and so perhaps there is here (comp. Jeremiah 51:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - A noise. The word is used elsewhere for the tumultuous sound of a marching army (see Isaiah 13:4; Isaiah 17:12). He will plead; rather, he will hold judgment. Jehovah's \"contending\" sometimes involves the notion of punishing, e.g. Ezekiel 38:22; Isaiah 66:16. In 2 Chronicles 22:8, the same verb in the same conjugation is forcibly rendered in the Authorized Version, \"to execute judgment.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - A great whirlwind; rather, a great storm (as Jeremiah 23:19). The coasts of the earth; rather, the furthest parts of the earth. The storm, as it appears on the horizon, comes as it were from the ends of the earth; perhaps, too, there is an allusion to the distant abode of the foe (comp. Jeremiah 6:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The slain of the Lord; i.e. those slain by the Lord, as Isaiah 66:16, where his sword is further spoken of as the agent (see on ver. 16). They shall not be lamented, etc.; parallel to Jeremiah 8:2; Jeremiah 16:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Wallow yourselves in the ashes. Supply rather, in the dust (comp. Micah 1:10), as more suitable to the figure (see on Jeremiah 6:26). The shepherds, and the principal (or, noble ones) of the flock, are, of course, merely different forms of expression for the rulers. The days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; rather, your days for being slaughtered are fulfilled; and I will scatter you (or, dash you in pieces). This is the reading of an old and valuable manuscript at St. Petersburg, and is partly favored by the pointing; it is adopted by most modern critics, the form in the text being ungrammatical. Pleasant; or, precious (comp. Daniel 11:8, Authorized Version). Compare the figure in Jeremiah 22:28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36, 37. - The prophet seems in his spirit to hear the lamentation to which in ver. 34 he summoned the \"shepherds.\" A voice of the cry should be, Hark I the cry (omitting \"shall be heard\"); the clause is an exclamation. Hath spoiled; rather, is spoiling (or, laying waste). The peaceable habitations; rather, the peaceful fields (or, pastures). Are cut down; rather, are destroyed; literally, are brought to silence (comp. Jeremiah 9:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah25:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Close of the prophecy with a fuller enunciation of the thought with which the paragraph was introduced. He hath forsaken; comp. ver. 30, and notice the impressive non-mention of the subject (as Jeremiah 4:13, etc.). Their land; i.e. that of the shepherds. The fierceness of the oppressor. A various reading, supported by some manuscripts, the Septuagint and the Targum, and accepted by Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf, and is the oppressing sword (so Jeremiah 46:16; Jeremiah 50:16). The text reading is very difficult to defend, and the punctuation itself is really more in favor of the variant than of the received text.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Jeremiah is to take his stand in the court of the Lord's house; i.e. the outer court, where the people assembled (comp. Jeremiah 19:14), and preach unto all the cities of Judah; i.e. to the pilgrims who had come from the provincial towns (comp. Jeremiah 11:12). His discourse is not to be an eloquent appeal to the feelings, but a strict and peremptory announcement; he is to diminish (or, subtract) not a word (comp. Deuteronomy 4:2; Deuteronomy 12:32; Revelation 22:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - That I may repent; literally, and I will repent; the idea or object is derived from the context. (On the Divine repentance, see note on Jeremiah 18:8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-6. - The contents of the discourse (see especially on Jeremiah 7:12-15). The priests and the prophets interfere, arrest Jeremiah, and accuse him of a capital crime. It would appear that some at least of the \"false prophets\" were priests; thus Pashur, we are told, was a priest (Jeremiah 20:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-11. - To all devout Jews this prediction of the destruction of the temple must have been startling; but to those who placed their confidence in the mere exist-once of a consecrated building (Jeremiah 7:4), it was like a blow aimed at their very life. Besides, were not the majority of the prophets of Jehovah of entirely another way of thinking? Did they not promise peace? And what could justify Jeremiah in announcing not merely war, but the downfall of the Divine habitation itself? Hence no sooner had the prophet concluded his discourse, than he was arrested, accused, and condemned to death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Had made an end of speaking. They allowed Jeremiah to finish his discourse (of which we have here only the briefest summary), either from a lingering reverence for his person and office, or to obtain fuller materials for an accusation (comp. the trial of Stephen, Acts 6:12-14). All the people. The \"people\" appear to have been always under some constraint. As long as the priests and prophets were alone, they dominated the unofficial classes, but when the princes appeared (ver. 11), the new influence proved superior. In ver. 16 princes and people together go over to the side of Jeremiah. Thou shalt surely die. Death was the legal penalty both for blasphemy (Leviticus 24:16) and for presuming to prophesy without having received a prophetic revelation (Deuteronomy 18:20). Jeremiah's declaration ran so entirely counter to the prejudices of his hearers that he may well have been accused of both these sins, or crimes. True, Isaiah and Amos had already predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (Isaiah 5:5, 6; Isaiah 6:11; Amos 2:4, 5; Amos 6:1, 2); but it may have been contended that the timely repentance of Judah under Hezekiah and Josiah had effectually cancelled the threatened doom, and though Isaiah 64:10, 11 evidently refers to a time later than Josiah, and represents the ruin of Jerusalem as practically certain, it would seem that the prophetic book (Isaiah 40-66.) to which this belongs (to say the least) was not generally known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Were gathered against; rather, assembled themselves unto; i.e. constituted themselves into a legal qahal, or assembly (see on ver. 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The princes. The term will include the members of the various branches of the royal family, who acted as judges (see on Jeremiah 21:12), and the \"elders,\" or heads of families (see ver. 17). Without the presence of the former, Jeremiah could only have had a mock-trial. Came up, etc. (see on Jeremiah 22:1). Of the Lord's house; better simply, of the Lord. The gate is the same which is referred at Jeremiah 20:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - This man is worthy to die; literally, a sentence of death (belongs) to this man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-15. - Jeremiah's defense. He is conscious that he has not spoken uncommissioned, and leaves the result. He urges the people to amendment of life, while there is time, and warns them that his own unmerited death will bring a curse upon themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-19. - The truth makes an impression upon the princes and the people, who declare Jeremiah to be a true prophet, and therefore innocent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The elders of the land add their voice in favor of Jeremiah, not, however, without first of all consulting the people whose representatives they are. The whole verse is thoroughly technical in its phraseology. The word (qahal) rendered \"assembly\" is the traditional legal term for the \"congregation of Israel\" (Deuteronomy 31:30); comp. ver. 9, where the verb is the corresponding one to qahal. Thus, with all the faults of the government of Judah, which Jeremiah himself reveals to us, it was very far removed from the Oriental despotisms of our day. The \"elders\" are still an important element in the social system, and form a link with that earlier period in which the family was the leading power in the social organization. Originally the term denoted, strictly and in the full sense, heads of families; they have their analogue in the councils of the Aryan village communities. \"References to their parliamentary status (if the phrase may be used) occur in Exodus 3:16; 2 Samuel 19:11; 1 Kings 8:1; 1 Kings 20:7. The institution lingered on during and after the Babylonian Exile (Jeremiah 29:1; Ezekiel 14:1; Ezekiel 20:1; Ezra 5:5; Ezra 6:7; Ezra 10:14; Matthew 26:3, 47; Mark 14:43; Acts 4:5, etc.).\" We find another reference to their quasi-judicial authority in Deuteronomy 21:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMicah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - Micah the Morasthite, etc. The \"elders\" appeal for a precedent to the case of Micah (called after his native place, Moresheth-Gath, to distinguish him from other Micahs), who had been equally explicit in his declarations of woe to Jerusalem, without incurring the charge of blasphemy. The prediction referred to is in Micah 3:12, the form of which agrees verbally with our passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDid Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thus might we procure, etc.; rather, and we are about to commit a great evil against our souls (not merely \"against ourselves\"). The blood of the slain would cry for vengeance against his murderers, who would come to an untimely end, their \"souls\" being sent down to lead a miserable parody of a life (βίος ἄβιος) in Sheol or Hades.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-23. - The murder of the prophet Urijah. At first sight, these four verses appear to belong to the speech of the elders, but the appearance is delusive,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because the issue of the affair of Urijah cannot possibly have taken place \"in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim\" (ver. 1); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because the passage stands in no connection with what precedes, whereas it is related, and that very closely, to ver. 24 (see below). The case is similar to that of certain passages in St. John's Gospel, where the reflections of the evangelist are put side by side with the sayings of our Lord. Jeremiah, writing down his experiences at a later time, introduces the story of Urijah to show the magnitude of the danger to which he had been exposed. The notice of Urijah has an additional importance, as it shows incidentally how isolated a spiritual prophet like Jeremiah was, and how completely the order of prophets had fallen below its high ideal. We have no further knowledge of the prophet Urijah. Verse 20. - Kirjath-jearim; a city in the territory of Judah, on the west frontier of Benjamin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - His mighty men. The \"mighty men\" (gibborim) are not mentioned again in Jeremiah, and the Septuagint omits the word. But it is clear from Isaiah 3:2 that the \"mighty men\" were recognized as an important part of the community. From 1 Chronicles 10:10 it appears that the term indicates a position of high command in the army, which is in accordance with the notice in 2 Kings 24:16. Went into Egypt. Egypt was the natural refuge for a native of Palestine (comp. 1 Kings 11:17, 40 Matt, 2:14), just as Palestine was for a native of Egypt. The latter, however, proved to be not a safe asylum for Urijah, as Pharaoh was the liege lord of Jehoiakim (2 Kings 23:34), and the extradition of Urijah as a criminal naturally followed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Elnathan. The name occurs again in Jeremiah 36:12, 25. Possibly this man was the \"Elnathan of Jerusalem\" mentioned in 2 Kings 24:8 as the father-in-law of Jehoiakim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Into the graves of the common people; literally, of the sons of the people (comp. Jeremiah 17:19; 2 Kings 23:6). \"The graves\" is equivalent to \"the graveyard,\" as Job 17:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah26:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Nevertheless the hand of Ahi-kant, etc.; i.e. in spite of the prepossession against prophets like Jeremiah which this incident reveals, Ahikam threw all his influence into the scale of toleration.' The same Ahikam is mentioned in circumstances which reflect credit on his religion in 2 Kings 22:12-14. One of his sons, Gemariah, lent Baruch his official room for the reading of the prophecies of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 36:10); another was the well-known Gedaliah, who became governor of Judah after the fall of Jerusalem, and who was himself friendly to Jeremiah (Jeremiah 39:14; Jeremiah 40:5).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim. The Syriao substitutes for, \"Jehoiakim\" \"Zedekiah,\" to bring the passage into conformity with Jeremiah 28:1, where the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah is expressly mentioned. But is this emendation sufficient? Can the fourth year be called the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah,\" When that reign lasted altogether only eleven years? Is it not probable that the transcriber has inadvertently copied the heading of Jeremiah 26, which corresponds verbally with Jeremiah 27:1, except that \"unto Jeremiah\" is wanting?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Make thee bends and yokes; rather, bands and poles; i.e. the bands which secured the two pieces of wood placed respectively above and beneath the neck of the ox, so forming a yoke. Hence, in Leviticus 26:13, we find the phrase, \"the poles [Authorized Version wrongly, 'the bands'] of your yoke.\" It is clear from Jeremiah 28:10 that this account is to be taken literally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And send them, etc. The letter of the text certainly suggests that Jeremiah actually delivered a separate yoke to each of the five ambassadors. Some commentators, however, finding such an act almost incredible, suppose the statement to be allegorical, and the \"sending of the yoke\" to mean the declaration of the subjection of the nations to Nebuchadnezzar which follows, somewhat as in Jeremiah 25:15 the \"causing all the nations to drink \"means the utterance of a prophecy of woe to the various peoples concerned. But we can hardly pronounce upon this passage by itself. We have to consider whether a whole group of similar statements is or is not to be taken literally. It may be enough to instance Jeremiah 13:1-7. Which come; rather, which are come.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - Jehovah is the Creator and Proprietor of the earth and all that is therein. Therefore he can give any part of it to whomsoever he will. Therefore, Jeremiah being his trustworthy prophet, the kings are called upon to take notice that Jehovah has transferred their kingdoms to Nebuchadnezzar. Observe, in Jeremiah 27-29. the form employed is not \"Nebuchadnezzar,\" but \"Nebuchadnezzar\" (so also Jeremiah 34:1; Jeremiah 39:5). (See on Jeremiah 21:7.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - My servant (see on Jeremiah 25:9). The Beasts of the field; i.e. the wild beasts. This last feature indicates the unlimited character of Nebuchadnezzar's power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Him, and his son, and his son's son. This is intelligible only if the seventy years predicted by Jeremiah in Jeremiah 25:11, 12, 29:10, are a round number. Nebuchadnezzar died in B.C. 561, and was succeeded by his son Evil-Merodach, who, after two years, was put to death by Neriglissar. In B.C. 555 Laberosoarchod (?) became king, but after nine months a usurper belonging to another family, Nabonedus or Nabunita, ascended the throne, which he occupied till B.C. 538, the year of the fall of Babylon. \"Seventy years,\" taken literally, only brings us to B.C. 555, seventeen years short of the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. Until the very time of his land come; rather, until the time of his own land come. Nebuchadnezzar cannot ensure his realm against captivity. Shall serve themselves of him (For the meaning of the phrase, see on Jeremiah 25:14.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Your dreamers; rather, your dreams. So in Jeremiah 29:8 the \"dreams\" of the people are expressly distinguished from the utterances of the prophets and soothsayers. In our passage the \"dreamers\" are appropriately mentioned between the \"diviners\" and the \"enchanters,\" because the skill of the soothsayers partly lay in the interpretation of dreams (comp. Genesis 41:8; Daniel 2:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - To remove you far; or, more distinctly, that I may remove you far.

Zedekiah had received a precisely similar message. Bring your necks. The plural is used, for Zedekiah was but an individual among a number of much more vigorous personalities (comp. on Jeremiah 22:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-22. - The warning to the priests and to the rest of the people. The last four verses of this section appear in a much shortened form in the Septuagint, and it must be admitted that the description is singularly lengthy. It is, therefore, quite conceivable that this is one of the cases in which the Hebrew text has been disfigured by willful interpolation. On the other hand, it is also possible that the description was filled out by an editor, e.g., by Baruch, conscientiously for the benefit of later readers. Verse 16. - The vessels of the Lord's house; i.e. the golden vessels which Solomon had made, and which Nebuchadnezzar had taken away (1 Kings 7:48-50; 2 Kings 24:13). Now shortly. These words are wanting in the Septuagint, and, considering that the Greek is also without the prediction in ver. 22, that the vessels of the temple and of the palace should be brought back in the day of visitation (which seems inconsistent with Jeremiah 52:17), the question arises whether the words \"now shortly\" here are not due to a hasty copyist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - But if they be prophets, etc. The \"false prophets,\" so Jeremiah declares, have neglected one of the principal functions of a prophet, viz. intercessory prayer (comp. on Jeremiah 7:16). Seeing that a part of the sacred vessels had been carried to Babylon, ell true prophets ought to intercede with Jehovah that those still left might be spared. The end was that the remaining vessels were carried off on the capture of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - This and the two following verses are thus given in the Septuagint: \"For thus saith the Lord... and the rest of the vessels which the king of Babylon took not, when he carried Jeconiah captive from Jerusalem; they shall come to Babylon, saith the Lord.\" This shortened form throws a light on the fact of the absence of \"now shortly\" in ver. 16 (see note). The pillars, etc.; i.e. the two bronze pillars called Jachin and Boaz (1 Kings 7:21). The sea; i.e. the molten \"sea,\" or basin (1 Kings 7:23).

It seems strange that the fourth year of a reign which only lasted eleven years in all should be called \"the beginning. Is it not probable that the clause was interpolated here by a later copyist on account of Jeremiah 27:1, where at present a similar clause (see note) is found? Originally placed in the margin as a gloss upon the words \"the same year,\" it would very easily find its way into the text. Hananiah... the prophet (see on ver. 15). Gibeon. This was a priestly city (Joshua 21:17), so that Hananiah was probably himself a priest like Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:1) and Pashur (Jeremiah 20:1). The modern El Jib, on an isolated, rocky hill, doubtless represents the ancient Gibeon. In the presence of the priests and of all the people. Apparently the event took place on either a new moon or a Sabbath, when the people would throng to the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Hananiah opens his prophecy with the usual formula, claiming Divine inspiration in the fullest sense. His message is short and sweet: I have broken - i.e. I have decreed to break (the perfect of prophetic certitude) - the yoke of the king of Babylon. Had Hananiah stopped here, he might, perhaps, have escaped Jeremiah's indignant rebuke. But with light-hearted arrogance he ventures to fix a time close at hand for the event, which, no doubt, was destined to occur, but after a long interval. Dr. Payne Smith suggests that he probably cherished the belief that the confederacy then on foot (Jeremiah 27:3) would defeat Nebuchadnezzar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithin two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And I will bring again... Jeconiah. Hananiah thus directly contradicts the assurance of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 22:26, 27) that Jehoiachin would not return, but would die in a foreign land. Has he a political object in his favorable prognostication for the deposed king? Does he, in short, belong to a Jehoiachin party opposed to the friends of Zedekiah? The view is possible, and may seem to be confirmed by the emphatic repetition of the fall of Nebuchadnezzar, the liege lord of Zedekiah. Still there is evidence enough in modern history that the return of an exile is not necessarily tantamount to his reinstatement in his office.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-9. - Jeremiah's reply. He heartily wishes that Hananiah's prediction were capable of fulfillment, but it runs directly counter to the declarations of all the older prophets. \"War, and evil, and pestilence\" was their constant burden, for the people to whom they prophesied were unworthy of the golden age of felicity in which the prophets so firmly believed. Only by a terrible judgment could the people of Israel be purified for the Messianic age. This appears to be what Jeremiah means by ver. 8. True, he speaks of \"countries\" and \"kingdoms\" in the plural, but all the great prophets include the nations best known to them within the range of their preaching, and even of their Messianic preaching. Isaiah, for instance, threatens sore judgment upon Egypt and Assyria, and yet he holds out the cheering prospect that Egypt and Assyria will have a part in the Messianic felicity. Thus Hananiah's prediction has probabilities very strongly against it He not only prophesies \"peace,' but attaches no condition to his promise, which, therefore, has double need of verification by the event (comp. Deuteronomy 18:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Instead of any rejoinder, Hananiah has recourse to violence, tears off and breaks the yoke on Jeremiah's neck, and repeats his declaration of the fall of Nebuchadnezzar within two years. Jeremiah meekly suffers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - No long time after this the prophet is commissioned to tell the bitter truth more fully than he had done before, and to warn Hananiah of his coming punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The yokes of wood; rather, a yoke of wood. The word rendered in the Authorized Version\" yokes\" means properly \"poles,\" two of which, with the \"bands,\" composed a \"yoke\" (see on Jeremiah 27:2). But thou shalt make; rather, but thou hast made. The sense in which Hananiah is said to have made \"a yoke of iron\" (we should render in the singular) comes out in ver. 14. The point is that there was a certain justification for Hananiah's violent act, but not that which he supposed. Jeremiah's wooden yoke was really an inadequate symbol; the prophet was too tender to his people. Thus God made the truth appear in still fuller brightness from the very perverseness of its enemy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The beasts of the field (see on Jeremiah 27:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet. In one sense Hananiah was a prophet as much as Jeremiah. He claimed to have received the prophetic call, and God alone, who searcheth the heart, could pronounce upon the justice of his claim. Whatever training was regarded as necessary for the office he had probably gone through, and now for a number of years he had been universally recognized as a member of the prophetic class. Probably he had those natural gifts, including a real, though dim and not unerring, \"second sight,\" which seems to have formed the substratum of Old Testament prophecy; but he certainly had not the moral backbone so conspicuous in Jeremiah, and he lacked that intimate communion with God (this became dear on the present occasion) which alone warranted the assurance that \"Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath sent me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will east thee; rather, I song thee away. Possibly, as Hitzig suggests, there is an allusion to the preceding verse, in which the same verb occurs. Thou hast taught rebellion; literally, thou hast spoken turning aside. To \"speak turning aside (or, 'rebellion')\" is a phrase of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 13:6), where it is used, as here, of opposition, not to Jehovah, but to revealed truth.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The residue of the elders; i.e. the surviving elders.

It had not only its \"princes\" and its \"elders,\" but its \"prophets\" and its \"diviners,\" who encouraged the same false hopes as those in Judah (comp. Jeremiah 27:9; Jeremiah 28:2).

At Babylon; rather, for Babylon. A long period, such as seventy years, is appointed for Babylon \"to enjoy\" the fruits of her ambition; when this is over (comp. Genesis 15:13-16), God will pay heed to his people. Visit you. To \"visit\" frequently has the sense of \"taking notice of,\" or \"paying heed to\" (e.g. Jeremiah 23:2). My good word. \"Word,\" equivalent to \"pro-raise;\" the allusion is to Jeremiah 24:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For I knew the thoughts, etc.; i.e. though seventy years must pass over you in exile, yet do not apprehend that I have forgotten you, for I know full well what my purpose is towards you - a purpose of restoring to you \"peace\" and prosperity. An expected end; rather, a future and a hope; i.e. a hopeful future (comp. Jeremiah 31:17, \"There is a hope for thy future\"). That unexpectant apathy which is the terrible accompaniment of so much worldly sorrow was not to be an ingredient in the lot of the Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And ye shall go and pray unto me. \"Go,\" that is, to the places \"where prayer is wont to be made.\" The clause seems to refer to common prayer for a common object.

Some eminent critics maintain that vers. 16-20 are an interpolation, and this view is certainly supported By the omission of these verses in the Septuagint. It must also in fairness be admitted that the natural connection of ver. 15 is with ver. 21, not with ver. 16. But it does not follow that vers. 16-20 are an arbitrary interpolation. They may be regarded either as a digression in the original letter, or as inserted by an after-thought when the substance of the letter was brought into its present form.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Know that thus saith the Lord; rather, Surely thus saith the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will send upon them, etc.; alluding to Jeremiah 24:10.

The prophet, by a very natural illusion, falls out of the style of letter-writer into that of the prophet. For the moment he fancies himself addressing an audience of his countrymen (comp. Jeremiah 25:3, 4, 7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Zedekiah. The name is into-resting; it shows that this prophet belonged to a family which took pleasure in the thought of Jehovah and his righteousness. Doubtless, too, he did so himself; but he under-estimated the demands of that righteousness, which extended to the heart as well as to the outward conduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A curse; i.e. a formula of cursing (comp. Isaiah 65:15). There is here a play upon words, such as the Biblical writers delighted in, partly with the view of assisting the memory. \"A curse\" is in Hebrew kelalah, and \"to roast\" is kalah. Roasted in the fire. \"Casting into the midst of a burning fiery furnace\" was a common punishment both among the Assyrians and the Babylonians, see e.g. ' Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 56; and comp. Daniel 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - An important and melancholy addition to our knowledge of these false prophets. They were not only misleading prophets, but immoral men in their private capacities. Villainy; rather, folly, as the word is always rendered elsewhere. The phrase \"to commit folly in Israel\" is always (except Joshua 7:15) used of sins of unchastity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-32. - A threatening oracle against the false prophet Shemaiah. Great excitement had been caused among the so-called prophets in Babylon by the emphatic language of Jeremiah. Accordingly one of them, named Shemaiah, wrote letters to the Jews at home, and especially to a high official called Zephaniah (see on ver. 26) to put a stop to Jeremiah's bold agitation. Zephaniah, however, was not the man for whom Shemaiah took him, and read the letter to the intended victim. Upon this, Jeremiah received a special revelation, announcing dire punishment to Shemaiah and his family (according to the principle of the Divine government described in Exodus 20:5). Verse 24. - To Shemaiah; or, of, concerning (as the same preposition is rendered in vers. 16, 21, 31). The oracle itself speaks of Shemaiah in the third person (vers. 31, 32). The Authorized Version, however, can be defended by its accordance with ver. 25. The Nehelamite. This is evidently a patronymic, but whether of the family or the locality of the bearer cannot be decided. The analogy of \"Jeremiah of Anathoth\" (ver. 27), however, favors the view that it is local.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - In the stead of Jehoiada the priest. Some (Grotius, Hitzig, Graf) think that this Jehoiada was the famous high priest of that name, who is said to have \"appointed officers over the house of the Lord\" (2 Kings 11:18; 2 Chronicles 23:18). It is true that Zephaniah was not literally the successor of Jehoiada, but he was so in the same metaphorical sense in which the scribes are said by our Lord to \"sit in Moses' seat\" (Matthew 23:2). It is safer, however, to suppose that another Jehoiada is meant, of whom we have no further information. It is not said that either Jehoiada or Zephaniah was high priest, and as the special object of the elevation of the latter is said to be the supervision of the temple police, it is more probable that Jehoiada and he were successively \"second priests,\" or, to use a phrase which seems to be synonymous, \"deputy governors in the house of the Lord\" (Jeremiah 20:1). The passage may thus without violence be harmonized with Jeremiah 52:24; 2 Kings 25:18, where Seraiah is called \"the chief priest\" and Zephaniah \"the second priest.\" It is possible that Jehoiada 'had been favorable to the better class of prophets. In this case there will be a delicate hint to Zephaniah that God had his own purpose in promoting him to honor, viz. that unruly prophets like Jeremiah might be held in with a tighter hand (Ewald). That ye should be officers; rather, that there should be officers. Zephaniah himself was an \"officer\" or \"deputy\" (see above); but he was also \"chief in the house of the Lord,\" and had the appointment of inferior \"officers,\" whose duty it was to preserve order in the temple. To understand the following words, we must remember that the outer court of the temple was a favorite place for prophetic teaching (comp. Jeremiah 7:2; Jeremiah 26:2). For every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet; i.e. to keep an eye upon \"madmen\" and prophetizers. The term \"mad\" is used in a disparaging sense (as 2 Kings 9:11; comp. Hosea 9:7), with regard to the apparently senseless behavior of those who were overpowered by the spirit of prophecy. In earlier times, no doubt, the phenomena of prophecy were more violently opposed to everyday life than in Jeremiah's time; but such symbolic acts as appearing in public with a yoke upon his neck would at least excuse the application of the epithet even to Jeremiah. It is more than probable, however, that it was not so much the abnormal actions as the contents of Jeremiah's prophecies which stirred up such vehement opposition; observe how in the next verse only the sound of these descriptive nouns is retained (\"which maketh himself a prophet\"). It was the making prophecy a reality which disturbed the men of routine, and Shemaiah well knew this when he made this appeal to Zephaniah. There was no harm in being nominally a \"prophet,\" but to \"make,\" or rather, \"show one's self as a prophet,\" to be an energetic prophet, a prophetizer (if the word may be invented), - this was wormwood to those who cried, \"Peace, peace,\" when there was no peace. In prison, and in the stocks; rather, in the stocks (see on Jeremiah 20:2) and in the collar. The meaning seems to be that Jeremiah was subjected to both forms of punishment at once.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Reproved; i.e. threatened with punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - For therefore, etc.; i.e. the consequence of Jeremiah's not having been kept within bounds by authority is that he has even ventured, in his fanatical zeal, to trouble the exiles in Babylon. This captivity is long; rather, It (is) long; a more forcible expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And Zephaniah the priest, etc. This should rather be printed as a parenthetical remark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah29:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-32. - Then came the word of the Lord, etc. A fresh introduction of the Divine oracle was rendered necessary by the long description of Zephaniah's letters. The reason for Shemaiah's punishment, however, is stated here a little differently. Of course, it was equally contrary to the will of God to deliver a false prophecy and to stir up persecution against his true prophet.

Presumably Jeremiah had received his call at Anathoth (comp. Jeremiah 1:1). I remember thee, etc.; rather, 1 remember for thy good the kindness of thy youth. It is an open question whether the \"kindness\" spoken of is that of God towards the people, or of the people towards God. The usage of the Hebrew (khesed) admits of either acceptation; comp. for the first, Psalm 5:7, 36:5, and many other passages; for the second, Hosea 6:4, 6 (in ver. 6 rendering for \"mercy,\" \"goodness\") and Isaiah 57:1 (rendering \"men of piety\"). But the context, which dwells so strongly on the oblivion into which the Divine benefits had been allowed to pass, is decidedly in favor of the first view. How beautiful is this condescending language! Jehovah's past feelings come Back to him; at least, so it appears to the believer, when God lets the light of his countenance shine forth again (comp. Jeremiah 31:20; Hosea 9:10). He even condescends to overlook the weakness and inconsistency of the Israel of antiquity. He idealizes it (i.e. Jeremiah is permitted to do so). This is in harmony with other prophetic passages (see Isaiah 1:26 (\"as at the first\"); Hosea 11:1, 3, 4; Ezekiel 16:6-14). The figure of the bride recurs constantly (see Hosea 2:19, 20; Isaiah 54:4, 5; Ezekiel 16:8). Thine espousals; rather, thy bridal state. When thou wentest after me (comp. Deuteronomy 8:2, \"all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIsrael was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Israel was holiness, etc. Israel was a consecrated people (comp. Exodus 19:5, 6; Deuteronomy 7:6; Deuteronomy 14:2; Deuteronomy 26:19). Isaiah, fond as he is of the phrase \"Israel's Holy One,\" does not expressly enforce the correlative truth, as Jeremiah does here. The first-fruits of his increase; rather, his firstfruits of increase. Israel is compared to the firstfruits (reshith) of the land, which were devoted to the house of the Lord (Exodus 23:19; Numbers 18:12, 13). So in Amos 6:1, the title given him is \"the chief [margin, 'firstfruits'] of the nations\" (in Jeremiah 31:7, a synonymous and cognate word, rosh, takes the place of reshith for \"chief\"). All that devour him shall offend; rather, all that ate him incurred guilt, or became guilty of a trespass. Foreigners were forbidden to eat of consecrated things; by breaking this law they became guilty of a \"trespass,\" having invaded the rights of Jehovah (Leviticus 22:10, 15, 16). The word for \"trespass\" is the same as that rendered \"guilt.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - What iniquity, etc.; rather, what unrighteousness, etc. (comp. Deuteronomy 32:4, \"a God of faithfulness, and without unrighteousness,\" alluding to the \"covenant\" between Jehovah and Israel). God's condescending grace (his 'anavah, Psalm 18:36). As if he were under an obligation to Israel (comp. Micah 6:3, etc.; Isaiah 5:3). Vanity; i.e. the idols; literally, a breath (so Jeremiah 10:15; Jeremiah 14:22; Jeremiah 16:19). Are become vain. The whole being of man is affected by the want of solid basis to his religion (comp. Jeremiah 23:16; Psalm 115:8); and the evident allusion to our passage in Romans 1:21 (St. Paul has ἐματαιώθησαν, as Septuagint here). The clause is verbally repeated in 2 Kings 17:15, with reference to the ten tribes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Neither said they, etc.; as their children's children were forced by stress of trouble to say (Isaiah 63:11; see note). A land of desserts and of pits. The first phrase applied to the region through which the Israelites passed (\"a wilderness\") was vague, and might mean merely pasture-land. The remainder of the description, however, shows that \"wilderness\" is here meant, as often (e.g. Isaiah 35:1; Isaiah 50:2), in the sense of \"desert.\" Though recent travelers have shown that the Sinaitie peninsula is not by any means universally a \"desert,\" and that in ancient times it was still less so, it is not unnatural that an agricultural people should regard it as a most inhospitable region, and should even idealize its terrors (comp. Deuteronomy 8:15). \"Pits,\" i.e. rents and fissures in the soil, in which the unwary traveler might lose his life (Jeremiah 18:20, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - A plentiful country. \"A Carmel land,\" as it were (so Payne Smith). \"Carmel\" is strictly an appellative noun, meaning\" garden-land,\" i.e., land planted with vines and other choice plants. So Jeremiah 4:26; Isaiah 29:17; Isaiah 37:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The priests, etc. The blame principally falls on the three leading classes (as in ver. 26; Micah 3:11). First on the priests who \"handle the Law,\" i.e. who have a traditional knowledge of the details of the Law, and teach the people accordingly (Deuteronomy 17:9-11; Deuteronomy 33:10; Jeremiah 18:18; see also on Jeremiah 8:8); next on the \"pastors,\" or \"shepherds\" (in the Homeric sense), the civil and not the spiritual authorities; so generally in the Old Testament (see Jeremiah 3:15; Jeremiah 10:21; Jeremiah 22:22; Jeremiah 25:34; Zechariah 10:3; Zechariah 11:5, 8, 16; Isaiah 44:28); and lastly on the prophets, who sought their inspiration, not from Jehovah (comp. note on ver. 30), but from Baal. To prophesy by (by means of) Baal or rather, the Baal, implies that prophecy is due to an impulse from the supernatural world; that it is not an objectifying of the imaginations of the prophet himself. Even the Baal prophets yielded to an impulse from without, but how that impulse was produced the prophet does not tell us. We are told in 1 Kings 22:19-23, that even prophets of Jehovah could be led astray by a \"lying spirit;\" much more presumably could prophets of the Baal. The Baal is here used as a representative of the idol-gods, in antithesis to Jehovah; sometimes \"Baalim,\" or the Baals, is used instead (e.g. ver. 23; Jeremiah 9:13), each town or city having its own Baal (\"lord\"). Things that do not profit. A synonym for idols (comp. Jeremiah 16:19; Isaiah 44:9;. 1 Samuel 12:21). An enlightened regard for self-interest is encouraged by the religion of the Bible, at any rate educationally. Contrast Comtism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will yet plead, etc. Repeated acts of rebellion call forth repeated abjurations and punishments. With your children's children. For God \"visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children\" (Exodus 20:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Justification of Jehovah's judicial action towards Judah. Consider the heinousness of the offence. Pass over - rather, pass over to - the isles of Chittim; i.e. the islands and maritime countries of the West, represented by Cyprus (see on Genesis 10:4). For the wide use of Chittim, comp. Numbers 24:24; Daniel 11:30). Kedar, in the narrower sense, is a large tribe of Arabian origin, whose haunts were between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia. Here, however, it is used in a wider sense for the Arab tribes in general (so Jeremiah Tiler 28; Isaiah 21:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Hath a nation changed their gods? Has any heathen nation ever changed its idol-god for another? The prophet clearly implies a negative answer; and yet it must be admitted that the adoption of a new religion, under the pressure of conquest or a higher foreign civilization is not an unknown phenomenon in the ancient world. Glory; i.e. source of all outward prosperity (comp. Psalm 3:3,\" my Glory, and the Lifter up Of my head\"). Religion was, in fact, the root of national life in antiquity; contrast our own division between the sacred and the secular Jehovah elsewhere receives the title \"the Pride of Israel\" -Authorized Version, rather weakly, \"the Excellency of Israel\" -(Amos 8:7; Hosea 5:5. Comp. the parallel passages, Psalm 106:20; Romans 1:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Be astonished. \"Be appalled\" would more nearly express the force of the Hebrew (so Jeremiah 18:16; Jeremiah 19:8). Be ye very desolate; literally, become dry; i.e. not so much \"shrivel and roll up\" (on the analogy of Isaiah 34:4), as \"become stiff with horror.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Two evils. Israel has not merely offended, like the heathen, by idolatry, but by deserting the only God who can satisfy the needs of human nature. The fountain of living waters. So Jeremiah 17:13 (comp. Psalm 36:9). Fountain; literally, tank or reservoir. Such reservoirs were \"dug in the ground (see on Jeremiah 6:7), and chiefly intended for storing living waters, i.e. those of springs and rivulets\" (Payne Smith). Cisterns, broken cisterns. A cistern, by its very nature, will only hold a limited amount, and the water \"collected from clay roofs or from marly soil, has the color of weak soapsuds, the taste of the earth or the stable.\" Who would prefer such an impure supply to the sweet, wholesome water of a fountain? But these cisterns cannot even be depended upon for this poor, turbid drink. They are \"broken,\" like so many even of the best rock-hewn cisterns (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 287). How fine a description of the combined attractiveness and disappointingness of heathen religions, qualities the more striking in proportion to the scale on which the religions problem is realized (e.g. in Hinduism)!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-19. - Israel's punishment and its cause. Verse 14. - Is Israel a servant? The speaker is evidently the prophet, who exclaims in surprise at the view which his prophetic insight opens to him: \"quasi de re nova et absurda sciscitatur\" (Calvin). For Israel is a member of Jehovah's family; he is not a servant (except in the same high sense as in Isaiah 40-53, where \"servant\" is virtually equivalent to \"representative\"), but rather in the highest degree a free man, for he is Jehovah's \"firstborn son\" (Exodus 4:22). How is it, then, that he is dragged away into captivity like a slave who has never known freedom? The view of some, that \"servant\" means \"servant of Jehovah\" (comp. Jeremiah 30:10), and that the question therefore is to be answered in the affirmative, is less natural. \"Servant,\" by itself, never has this turning; and there is a precisely similar term in the discourse at ver. 31, where the negative answer of the question does not admit of a doubt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The young lions, etc. A fresh figure, and a most natural one in Judaea (comp. 1 Samuel 17:34); already applied to the Assyrians by Isaiah (Isaiah 5:29, 30). Burned; rather, made ruinous (corer. \"ruinous heaps,\" 2 Kings 19:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Also the children of Noph, etc. This is the climax of the calamity. Noph, called Moph in the Hebrew text of Hosea 9:6, is generally identified with Memphis (after the Septuagint), which was called in the inscriptions Mennufr, or \"the good abode,\" but may possibly be Napata, the Nap of the inscriptions, the residency of the Ethiopian dynasty (De Rouge'). Tahapanes. The Hebrew form is Takhpanes or Tahhpanhhes. This was a fortified frontier town on the Pelusiot arm of the Nile, called in Greek Daphnae (Herod., 2:20), or Taphnae (Septuagint here). Have broken, etc.; rather, shall break, or (for the pointing in the Hebrew Bible requires this change) shall feed off (or depasture). From this verse onwards, Judah is personified as a woman, as appears from the suffixes in the Hebrew. Baldness was a great mark of disgrace (2 Kings 2:23; Jeremiah 48:45). There is a striking parallel to this passage in Isaiah 7:18-20, where, in punishment of the negotiations of Ahaz with Assyria, the prophet threatens an invasion of Judah both by Assyria and by Egypt: and employs the very. same figure (see ver. 20). So here, the devastation threatened by Jeremiah is the punishment of the unhallowed coquetting with the Egyptian power of which the Jewish rulers had been recently guilty. The fact which corresponds to this prediction is the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo, and the consequent subjugation of Judah (2 Kings 23:29). The abruptness with which ver. 16 follows upon ver. 15 suggests that some words have fallen out of the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Hast not thou procured this? rather, Is it not this that doth procure it unto thee (namely) that thou hast forsaken, etc.? or, Is it not thy forsaking Jehovah that pro. cureth thee this? When he led thee by the way. The prophet thinks, perhaps, of the rebellion of the forefathers of Israel, who too soon ceased to \"go after\" Jehovah (comp. ver. 2), and whose fickleness was imitated but too well by their descendants. This view is favored by the phraseology of Deuteronomy 1:33; Deuteronomy 8:2, 15. But we may, if we prefer it, explain \"by (or, rather, in) the way,\" on the analogy of the promise in Jeremiah 31:9, \"I will lead them... in a straight way,\" i.e. I will grant them an uninterrupted course of prosperity. The omission of the adjective in the present passage may be paralleled by Psalm 25:8, \"Therefore will he instruct sinners in the (right) way.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - What hast thou to do in the way of Egypt? rather, with the way to Egypt. Isaiah (Isaiah 30:2-5; Isaiah 31:1) and Hosea (Hosea 7:11, 16) had already inveighed against an Egyptian alliance. The name given by Manasseh to his sen and successor (Amen) suggests that at one period in his reign an Egyptian policy was in the ascendant, which coincides with the tradition preserved in 2 Chronicles 33:11, of an Assyrian captivity of Manasseh. Jehoiakim at a later period was a vassal of Egypt (2 Kings 23:31, 35). To drink the waters; taking up the idea of the second clause of ver. 13. Sihor, or Shihor, occurs again in Isaiah 23:3, as a name of the Nile. It properly means, not so much \"the black\" as \"the dark grey\" (connected with shakhar, the morning grey), from the color of the water. Rosenmüller's contrast between the muddy waters of foreign streams and the \"fountain of living waters\" is uncalled for; besides, the Nile water has always been held in high esteem. The Septuagint has Γηών, i.e. Gihon, also a name of-the Nile according to Ecclus. 24:27. The way of - rather, to - Assyria. It is true that Assyria was, to say the least, powerless to interfere for good or for evil, when these words were written. But in ver. 5 the prophet has already warned us that his complaints are partly retrospective. It would seem that the Assyrian party from time to time gained the upper hand over the Egyptian in the councils of the State. Or perhaps the prophet may refer to the Quixotic fidelity to Assyria of Josiah (see below on ver. 36). The river; i.e. the Euphrates, \"the great river\" (Genesis 15:18). Babylonia it should be remembered, was in nominal subjection to Assyria; the Euphrates was the boundary between Syria and Palestine on the one hand, and Assyria - here the Assyrio-Babylonian region - on the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Shall correct... shall reprove; rather, chastise... punish. It is a constantly renewed punishment which follows the ever-repeated offence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Here a new section begins. I have broken... burst. This is, grammatically, a possible rendering, but inconsistent with the second person in thou saidst, unless indeed (with Ewald) we suppose that something has fallen out of the text between the first and the second clauses of the verse. The best critics, except Ewald and Dr. Payne Smith, are agreed that we should follow the Septuagint and Vulgate in rendering \"thou hast broken... (and) burst.\" This does not, strictly speaking, imply a new reading of the text, for ti was the old form of the suffix of the 2nd pers. fem, sing.; there is a precisely similar case in Micah 4:13. It is a true description of the history of Israel before the exile. It would almost seem as if there was a fusion of two races among the Israelites, and that the smaller but nobler stock supplied all the great men in the sphere of religion; just as in Florence, most of the men who have illustrated her annals bear names of Teutonic origin. So we might argue, if we wished to explain the Biblical history from purely natural causes. But God (to apply the Caliph Omar's words) \"knoweth his own.\" Bands (see on Jeremiah 5:5). I will not transgress. This is the translation of the marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible, which, though implied also in the Targum, is probably a conjecture of the Jewish critics. The text reading (also that of the Septuagint and the Syriac) is, \"I will not serve,\" (equivalent to \"I will not be a slave any longer\"). Obviously this does not harmonize with the rendering \"I have broken,\" etc., in the first clause (unless, with Dr. Payne Smith, we explain \"I will not serve\" as virtually equivalent to \"I will still serve my idol-gods\"); hence the Jewish critics, by just adding a κέραια (Matthew 5:18), changed \"serve\" into \"transgress.\" They did not venture to alter the next clause, which, quite as much as the first, presupposes the reading \"serve\" (see next note). When - rather, for - upon every high hill, etc. Bare, treeless heights were favorite spots for sacrifices, especially for Baal; groves, and leafy trees, in general, for the lascivious rites of Asherah and Ashtoreth. The apparently extreme statement of the prophet is not to be minimized. Travelers still tell us of vestiges of ancient and doubtless pro-Christian idolaters worship still visible on almost every attractive spot in the open country in Palestine. Under every green tree. We have no single word to convey the \"fluid\" meaning of this expressive word. It combines, in fact, the senses of pliant, sappy, leafy (comp. note on Jeremiah 11:16). Thou wanderest; rather, thou wast stretching thyself out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - A noble vine. Jeremiah means the choicest kind of Oriental vine, called sorek (from the dark-red color of its grapes), and mentioned again in Isaiah 5:2. The figure of the vine is one endeared to us by its association especially with our Lord; it was endeared to the Jews by the annual festivities of the vintage. The sacred writers are never afraid of its palling on the ear by repetition (comp. Jeremiah 5:10; Jeremiah 6:9; Jeremiah 12:10; Isaiah 5:1-7; Isaiah 27:2, 3; Ezekiel 17:6; Psalm 80:8-16). A right seed; i.e. a vine-shoot of the genuine sort. \"Seed\" for \"shoot,\" as in Isaiah 17:11 (scrap. ver. 10). The degenerate plant; rather, degenerate shoots (if at least the text is right).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Nitre does not mean the substance which now bears that name, but \"natron,\" a mineral alkali, deposited on the shores and on the bed of certain lakes in Egypt, especially those in the Wady Nat-run (the ancient Nitria, whence came so large a store of precious Syriac manuscripts). In ancient times, this natron was collected to make lye from for washing purposes (comp. Proverbs 25:20). Sope; rather, potash; the corresponding vegetable alkali (comp. Isaiah 1:25). Thine iniquity is marked. So Kimchi and Gesenius (through a doubtful etymology); but the Aramaic use of the word favors the rendering stained, i.e. filthy. The word is in the participle, to indicate the permanence of the state (comp. \"Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood,\" etc.? 'Macbeth').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - How canst thou say, etc.? This is not a mere rhetorical fiction equivalent to \"or if thou shouldst perhaps say,\" but probably represents an objection really made by the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah. Their fault was not in neglecting the public worship of Jehovah in his appointed temple, but in superadding to this, idolatrous rites inconsistent with the spiritual religion taught by Jeremiah. The people did not, it seems, regard this as tantamount to \"following Baalim,\" just as some converts to Christianity in our own foreign missions might exclaim against being accused of apostasy, because they secretly carry on certain heathen practices. The prophet, however, applies a more rigorous test to their conduct. Baalim; the plural of Baal, used for \"other gods\" (Jeremiah 1:16; comp. on ver. 8). Thy way in the valley. The valley in this context can only be that of Hinnom (see on Jeremiah 7:31), which from the time of Ahaz had been defiled with the rites of \"Moloch, horrid king\" (see ' Paradise Lost,' 1:392-396). Thou art a swift dromedary. Ewald would attach this half of the verse to ver. 24; and there is something to be said for this plan. Swift dromedary is, properly speaking, in the vocative. The ardor of the people for idolatry is expressed by the comparison of it to the uncontrollable instinct of brute beasts. The word rendered \"dromedary\" is in the feminine gender; it means strictly the young she-camel which has not yet had a foal. Traversing her ways; rather, interlacing her ways; i.e. running backwards and forwards at the impulse of passion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A wild ass, etc. The type of wildness and independence (comp. Genesis 16:12; Job 39:5-8). That snuffeth up the wind; to cool the heat of her passion. In her occasion... in her month; i.e. at the pairing-time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Withhold thy foot, etc. Hitzig, with unnecessary ingenuity, explains this with reference to the fatiguing practices of the heathen cultus, comparing 1 Kings 18:26, where \"vain repetitions\" of \"Baal, Baal,\" and (as he thinks) barefoot religious dances, are mentioned as parts of the worship of Baal. Umbreit's view, however, is far more natural. \"God the true husband exhorts Israel not to run barefoot, and with parched throat, like a shameless adulteress, after strangers\" (Payne Smith). There is no hops; i.e. the exhortation is in vain (so Jeremiah 18:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Is... ashamed. It is the per-feet of prophetic certitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And to a stone, etc. Stone ('ebhen) is feminine in Hebrew, and therefore addressed as the mother.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - According to the number of thy cities, etc. A remarkable statement, and one that well illustrates the superficial character of Hezekiah's reformation. True, Manasseh's reactionary reign had intervened, but his counter-movement would not have been so successful had it not been attended by the good wishes of the people; and besides, the last years of Manasseh, according to the tradition in 2 Chronicles 33:12-16 were devoted to undoing the mischief of his former life. The force of the prophet's words is strikingly brought out by M. Renan (he led an expedition to Phoenicia), who has shown that every district and every town had a cultus of its own, which often only differed from the neighboring cultus by words and titles (nomina, numina); comp. Baal-Hamon, Baal-Hazor, eta Dr. Payne Smith well expresses the argument of Jeremiah: \"When every city has its special deity, surely among so many there might be found one able to help his worshippers.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Wherefore will ye plead with me? How can ye be so brazen-faced as to attempt to justify yourselves?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Have I smitten your children. The cities and towns of Judah are represented as so many mothers, and the populations as their children. It would, no doubt, be more natural to take \"children\" literally; but then we must read the verb in the next clause, \"Ye have received,\" as the Septuagint actually renders. In the former case the \"smiting\" will refer to all God's \"sore judgments\" -sword, drought, famine, pestilence; in the latter, to the loss of life in battle. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets (comp. 2 Chronicles 24:21; 2 Kings 21:16). Manasseh's persecution (which extended, according to Josephus, especially to the prophets) may account for the preponderance of \"false prophets\" referred to in ver. 8 (cf. Matthew 23:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - O generation, see ye. It is doubtful whether generation here means \"contemporaries\" (equivalent to \"men of this generation\"), or, like γενεά sometimes in the New Testament, a class of men united by moral affinity (comp. Psalm 14:5; Psalm 78:8). In the latter case we should rather attach the pronoun in \"see ye\" to \"O generation,\" and render \"O (evil) generation that ye are!\" So Hitzig, Keil, and Payne Smith; Ewald and Delitzsch adopt the first rendering. Have I been a wilderness, etc.? \"Have I not been the source of light and happiness to my people, and of all temporal blessings?\" (comp. Jeremiah 2:6). So the Divine speaker in Isaiah 45:19, \"I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain,\" or more literally, \"in chaos\" (same word as in Genesis 1:2); \"chaos\" and \"the wilderness\" are both images of that which is utterly unremunerative. A land of darkness. This is, of course, not literally accurate as a description of the Arabian desert. \"Darkness\" is here used as a synonym for \"misery.\" Cloud and rain occupy precisely opposite places in the estimation of nomadic and agricultural peoples respectively. \"The Bedouins,\" says an Arabic scholast, \"always follow the rain and the places where raindrops fall;\" whereas a townsman of Mecca calls himself \"child of the sun.\" So Indra and Varuna, originally belonging to the cloudy and rainy sky, are in the Vedic hymns endowed with solar traits. It should be added here that it is an old problem, and too difficult a one for us to investigate, whether we should render \"the darkness of Jah\" (Jehovah) or (as Authorized Version) simply \"darkness.\" The former rendering will mean very great darkness, such as Jehovah sends in judgment (e.g. to the Egyptians, Exodus 10:21-23). On this question, see Dr. Ginsburg on Song of Solomon 8:6 (where a similar doubt exists), Geiger's 'Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel,' p. 276; Ewald, 'Lehrbuch der Hebraischen Sprache,' § 270 e. We are lords; rather, we have broken loose. It is, however, a difficult word, which only occurs elsewhere in Genesis 26:40; Hosea 12:1; Psalm 55:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Or a bride her attire. The prophet perhaps means the magnificently adorned girdle which the bride wore on her wedding day (comp. Isaiah 49:18). But the word only occurs again in Isaiah 3:20, and its precise signification is uncertain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Why trimmest thou thy way I rather, How well thou contrivest thy way, etc.? Therefore hast thou also taught, etc. The meaning which floated before our trans-labors seems to be this: \"so utterly immoral is thy course of life, that even the worst of women ['wicked ones' is in the feminine] have been able to learn something from thee\" (so the great Dutch scholar, De Dieu,in 1548). But a more natural rendering is, \"Therefore [i.e. to gain thine ends] thou hast accustomed thy ways to those evil things.\" Nemo repente fuit tupissimus. It required a deliberate \"accustoming,\" or \"training\" (such is the literal meaning of limad), to produce such a habit (ἕξις) as is here rebuked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Also in thy skirts, etc.; or, there is even fennel in thy skirts (or, perhaps, in thy sleeves - the wide sleeves of an Eastern mantle). The fact which follows is adduced as the crowning evidence of wickedness. Blood of the souls is explained by the statement in Leviticus 17:11, \"The soul of the flesh [i.e. of the body] is in the blood;\" hence the importance of the blood in the Mosaic sacrifices. The historical reference of this passage of Jeremiah may well be to the persecution of Manasseh, who is said to have \"shed innocent blood very much\" (2 Kings 21:16). It is Judah, no doubt, who is addressed, but the prophets mostly assume the \"solidarity\" of king and people (analogous to that of a forefather and his posterity); Manasseh, moreover, probably had the support of a large section of the population, at any rate in so far as he favored the inveterate cultus of the high places or local sanctuaries. I have not found it by secret search; rather, thou hast not found them breaking through (houses). The phraseology agrees with that of Exodus 22:2, the law against \"breaking through;\" it suggests that the houses of all but the highest class in ancient as well as often in modern Palestine, were made of mere sun-dried brick, which could be easily \"dug into\" (comp. Ezekiel 12:5; Matthew 6:19, 20, in the Greek). [Lieut. Conder states, it is true, that in hilly districts of Palestine the houses of the villages are built of stone, but he adds that the stone is simply taken from the ruins of the ancient towns.] Burglars caught in the act might be killed (Exodus 22:2), but the innocent victims of persecution could not be brought under this category, and hence those who slew them were really guilty of murder. But upon all these; rather, but because of all these things; i.e. not for any crime, but because of thine things,\" as in Jeremiah 3:7); so Hitzig, Keil Payne Smith; less naturally De Dieu, \"because of those false gods\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Because. This \"because\" is misleading; there is no argument, but the statement of a supposed fact. The particle so rendered merely serves to introduce the speech of the Jews (like ὅτι). Shall turn; rather, hath turned. Judah had so long been undisturbed by any foreign power, that the people fancied the promises of Deuteronomy were being fulfilled, and that they, on their part, had pleased God by their formal obedience (comp. 2 Kings 22:17). I will plead with thee. Here, as in some other passages (e.g. Isaiah 66:16; Ezekiel 38:22), the word includes the sense of punishing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Why gaddest thou about so much - many render, Why runnest thou so quickly; but the verb simply means to go, and it is enough to refer to foreign embassies, such as are alluded to in this very chapter (ver. 18) - to change thy way? The \"way\" or policy of Judah was \"changed,\" according as the party in power favored an Egyptian or an Assyrian alliance. Thou also shalt be ashamed of; rather, thou shalt also be brought to shame through. As thou art ashamed of Assyria (correct rendering as before). This is certainly difficult, for in the reign of Josiah it would appear that the political connection with Assyria still continued, Is it possible that Jeremiah, in these words, has in view rather the circumstances of Jehoiakim than those of Josiah? Does he not appear to look back upon Judah's final \"putting to shame through Assyria\" as a thing of the past? And to what event can this expression refer but to the overthrow of Josiah at Megiddo (so Graf)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah2:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - From him; i.e. from Egypt, personified as a man (so whenever a people is referred to; a laud is represented as a woman). Egypt was, in fact, the only great power capable of assisting Judah at this time (see Introduction); yet even Egypt, the prophet says, shall disappoint her Jewish allies, for Jehovah has rejected thy confidences (i.e. the objects of thy confidence). As a matter of fact, \"the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his laud\" after Necho's crushing defeat at Carehemish (2 Kings 24:7; comp. Jeremiah 37:5).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Write thee all the words... in a book. The form of expression leaves it doubtful whether a summary of all Jeremiah's previous discourses is intended, or merely of the promises concerning Israel and Judah which he had just received. There are, no doubt, numerous allusions to preceding chapters, but ver. 5 seems rather to favour the latter view. The word rendered \"book\" will equally suit a short discourse like the present (comp. Jeremiah 51:60) and a large collection of prophecies as in Jeremiah 36:2. Observe, the discourse was to be written down at once, without having been delivered orally; it was to be laid up as a pledge that God would interpose for his people (comp. Isaiah 30:8; Habakkuk 2:2, 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11. - The great judgment of Israel's deliverance. It is nothing less than the \"day of Jehovah\" which the prophet sees in spirit - a day which is \"great\" (ver. 7; comp. Joel 2:11; Zephaniah 1:14) and terrible (vers. 5, 6; comp. Amos 5:18, 20; Isaiah 13:6; Joel 2:1, 11) for Israel, a day of \"trouble\" (ver. 7), but for his enemies of destruction. Verse 5. - A voice of trembling; rather, a sound of trembling, a sound causing men to tremble; doubtless it is \"the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war\" (Jeremiah 4:19). Of fear, and not of peace; rather, there is fear, and no peace. \"Peace,\" as usual, means the harmony of a well ordered, secure, and peaceful community. Literally, it is wholeness; its opposite is \"breaking,\" i.e. outward ruin and inward anguish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAsk ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Whether a man doth travail with child. Great, indeed, must be the terror when no adequate figure suggests itself but that of a woman in her pangs (comp. Jeremiah 6:24; Jeremiah 13:21; Jeremiah 22:23; Isaiah 13:8). All faces are turned into paleness. So Joel (Joel 2:6) and Nahum (Nahum 2:10), \"All faces withdraw their colour.\" For \"paleness\" the Septuagint has \"jaundice\" - a possible meaning of the Hebrew; comp. χλωρὸς, \"pale, bilious looking\" in medical writings, but properly \"greenish-yellow,\" like the Hebrew noun.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - That day; i.e. \"the day of Jehovah,\" the day of the great judgment upon the world, of which the fall of Babylon is regarded as the opening scene. It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; rather, and a time of distress shall it be (even) to Jacob.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - His yoke. Not that imposed by the enemy (as Isaiah 10:22 and Isaiah 14:25 might suggest), but that suffered by Jacob. This is clear from the last clause of the verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - David their king; viz. the \"righteous Branch\" or \"Plant\" of ch. 23:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, etc. These two verses, omitted in the Septuagint, are among the passages which Hitzig (carrying out an idea of Movers) attributes to the editorial hand of the author (a pious Jew of the Captivity, according to him) of Isaiah 40-66, and it cannot be denied that the tone and phraseolegy of ver. 10 is more akin to that of Isaiah 40:66, than to those of the greater part of Jeremiah. Graf, in controverting Hitzig's view, points out, however, that the expressions referred to by Hitzig as \"Deutero-Isaianic,\" are also found in other books besides the latter part of Isaiah, and that, on the other hand, \"the expressions of ver. 11 are all as foreign to Isaiah 40-66, as they are current in Jeremiah.\" As for the expression, \"my servant Jacob.\" (which. only occurs again in Jeremiah in the duplicate of this passage, Jeremiah 46:27, 28, and which is specially characteristic of the second part of Isaiah), it is worth noticing that it is found once in the Book of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:25), which, on Hitzig's theory, was written before the so called Second Isaiah. It still remains for the student to consider whether these two verses are not an insertion by some later hand (without attempting to discover whose that hand was). That the prophetic writings have received additions from editors and scribes is a fact which cannot reasonably be gainsaid, supported as it is by the phenomena of the historical books. It would be very natural for a pious Jew in the Captivity, not wholly devoid himself of the spirit of prophecy, to encourage his people, in the Name of the Lord, with this glowing word of promise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In measure; rather, according to what is just; i.e. not capriciously, to satisfy a feeling of revenge such as the untaught mind is apt to ascribe to God (see on Jeremiah 10:24). And will not, etc.; rather, for I cannot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - Miserable indeed is the condition of Israel! No wonder; for its sins were great. And yet, just because it is so forlorn, Jehovah will interpose for its relief. Verse 12. - For thus saith, etc. If the two preceding verses are a later insertion, we must render, But surely (more strictly, surely, but particles of asseveration easily acquire an adversative force from the context). Bright, indeed, is the prospect for Judah, \"but surely\" his present condition is very much the reverse; comp. Isaiah 9:1 (Authorized Version,\" nevertheless\"). Thy bruise is incurable, etc. One of Jeremiah's characteristic repetitions (see Jeremiah 10:19; Jeremiah 14:17; Jeremiah 15:18). That thou mayest be bound up. This rendering follows the accents. But the mixture of figures is very incongruous. It is much better to connect the words a little differently and to render, for thy sore thou hast no medicines (nor any) plaster.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - All thy lovers; i.e. the peoples confederate with thee (as Jeremiah 22:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Therefore; i.e. because of the extremity of thy need. Comp. Isaiah 10:23, 24, \"The Lord Jehovah Sabaoth shall make a consumption Therefore be not afraid of Assyria;\" and Isaiah 30:17, 18, \"At the rebuke of five shall ye flee ....

They called thee an Outcast. Jehovah, speaking after the manner of men. cannot bear to hear his enemies, as they pass along, scornfully denominating the holy city an Outcast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-22. - A picture of the regenerate commonwealth of Israel. Verse 18. - Upon her own heap; rather, upon her own mound, the tell or eminence on which an Eastern town was built (comp. Joshua 11:13, where \"in their strength\" should rather be \"on their own mound\"). Shall remain; rather, shall be inhabited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - (Comp. this verse with Jeremiah 33:11.) Out of them; i.e. out of city and palace. They shall not be few; rather, not be diminished. They shall not be small; rather, not be lightly regarded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Their children; rather, his children; i.e. the \"children of Israel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The future rulers of Israel shall be of the native stock, not foreign tyrants. Their nobles; rather, his noble one, a synonym for \"his ruler,\" i.e. the (earthly) king of Israel. It is remarkable that no reference is made here to the Messiah, who, in fact, is not as conspicuous a figure in the prophecies of Jeremiah as in those of Isaiah. And yet even in Isaiah there is one striking prophecy in which the inspired seer uses language not (in the hands of a literalist) reconcilable with the prospect of the personal Messiah. The Messiah appears, as it were, in a lightning flash, and then disappears for a time. The prophecy of Isaiah referred to is Isaiah 32:1, 2 (comp. Jeremiah 33:17), in which the prospect of a truly God-fearing king, with princes of the same high character, entirely occupies the mind of the writer. \"Nothing indicates that the Messiah is intended; king and princes are placed quite on a level, in accordance with the actual state of things under the so called monarchy.\" And I will cause him to draw near. It is doubtful whether Israel or Israel's ruler is referred to. A priestly relation (such as \"drawing near\" implies, see Numbers 16:5) might be predicated of either, at any rate in the regenerate form of the Israelitish commonwealth; but it is more natural to suppose the ruler to be here indicated, for it is scarcely descriptive enough to say that he shall belong to the chosen people. Who is this that engaged his heart; rather, that pledgeth his heart (or, courage); i.e. that ventureth. The rejection of thee old line of Davidic kings might well raise the thought that the intimate relation between Jehovah and his earthly representative for Israel, promised of old to David (2 Samuel 7.), could no longer be hoped for. But with this renewed promise the kings of the new Davidic line may venture to \"draw near;\" otherwise - who is he that ventureth?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - This verse is omitted in the Septuagint, and (unless the existence of later insertions is denied altogether) is all but certainly due to a later hand (comp.

The expression clearly implies that the Jews at the time spoken of had escaped, or were about to escape, in some great battle or some other kind of slaughter. Hence the finding grace in the wilderness cannot refer to the sequel of the passage through the Red Sea, and we must perforce explain it of the second great deliverance, viz. from the Babylonian exile. This view is strongly confirmed by Jeremiah 51:50, where the Israelites who escape the predicted slaughter at Babylon are called \"escaped ones from the sword,\" and exhorted to remember Jehovah and Jerusalem \"afar off.\" The \"wilderness\" of the present passage, like the \"afar off\" of ch. 51. (and of the next verse) seems to mean Babylon, which was, by comparison with the highly favoured Judah, a \"barren and dry land\" (comp. Psalm 63:1), a spiritual Arabia. It may be objected that the tense here is the perfect; but there is abundance of analogy for explaining it as the prophetic perfect. The restoration of the chosen people to favour is as certain in the Divine counsels as if it were already an event past. (It seems less appropriate to understand \"the wilderness\" of the country which separated Assyria from Palestine. It was in Babylon that the covenant of Sinai was renewed to God's repentant people.) Even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest; rather, when I went to cause Israel to rest (literally, to cause him - Israel - to rest; but the pleonastic pronoun need not be represented in the English). Another possible and perhaps preferable rendering is, I will go to cause, etc. \"Rest\" could only be had in the consciousness of God's favor. With all the outward property of many of the Jews in Babylon, there was no true \"rest.\" Comp. chap. 16, \"Ask for the old paths.., and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls\" (the same verbal root in the Hebrew for \"rest\" in both passages).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Lord hath appeared of old unto me. The Church of the faithful Israel is the speaker. \"From afar\" (so we ought to render, rather than \"of old\") she sees Jehovah, with the eye of faith, approaching to redeem her; comp. Isaiah 40:10 and Isaiah 59:20 (only that in these passages it is to Jerusalem, and not to Babylon, that Jehovah \"comes\" as the Redeemer); also the promise in Jeremiah 30:10, \"I will save thee from afar,\" and Jeremiah 51:50, quoted above. (Septuagint reads \"unto him;\" but an abrupt change of person is not uncommon in Hebrew.) Saying, Yea, I have loved thee, etc. \"Saying\" is inserted to make the connection plainer. The genius of Hebrew does not require such a distinct indication of a change of speakers as our Western languages. For other instances of this, see Genesis 4:25; Genesis 26:7; Genesis 32:31; 1 Kings 20:34. With loving kindness have I drawn thee; rather, do I continue loving kindness unto thee. \"To continue\" is literally, to draw out at length. The idea is the same as that in the great prophecy which follows that of the suffering Saviour, \"With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee\" (Isaiah 54:8; comp. ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will build thee. A nation, like a family, is frequently compared to a building (so Jeremiah 12:16; Jeremiah 24:6; comp. Ephesians 2:22). O virgin of Israel. The people of Israel is personified as a virgin (comp. Jeremiah 14:7). Adorned with thy tabrets, The expression will not, of course, bear to be logically criticized, for it was not the whole people who went out with \"tabrets\" or \"timbrels,\" but the \"damsels,\" who, it is true, formed an important part of religious processions (Psalm 68:25), and doubtless of secular ones also (comp. Judges 11:34). Joyousness is an essential part of the Biblical ideal both of religion and of a normal state of society: \"The joy of the Lord is your strength.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The mountains of Samaria. \"Samaria\" is used, equally with Ephraim, for the northern kingdom. Shall eat them as common things; rather, shall enjoy the fruit. The word, however, literally means shall profane them. The more common phrase, \"shall eat the fruit,\" occurs in Isaiah 65:21, where the same promise is given. The law was that newly planted fruit trees should be left alone for three years; that in the fourth year their fruit should be consecrated to God; and that in the fifth year their fruit might be \"profaned,\" i.e. devoted to ordinary uses (comp. Deuteronomy 20:6; Deuteronomy 28:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The termination of the schism between north and south will be shown by the anxiety of the Ephraimites (see on \"Samaria,\" ver. 5) to take part with their brethren in the festival of the new moon. It was the custom, at any rate in later times, to station watchmen at elevated points to give notice of the first appearance of \"the slender sickle, which shines so brightly in the clear Oriental heaven\" Let us go up. Not with reference to the physical elevation of Jerusalem, for the phrase, \"to go up,\" is used of an army withdrawing from Jerusalem (Jeremiah 21:2; Jeremiah 34:21). This seems to indicate that the term was sometimes used in a weakened sense, to which parallels might easily be given. These words, \"Arise ye, and let us go up,\" etc., were, at a later period, the formula with which the leader of the pilgrims from any particular district summoned the members of his caravan to fall into the procession.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-14. - The restoration of Israel; its blessedness and joyousness. Verse 7. - Sing with gladness, etc. It is not stated who are addressed; but we may doubtless understand, from Isaiah 66:10, \"all ye who love him,\" whether Jews or Gentiles. The latter, too, are interested in the restoration of Israel, because Israel is as it were a \"priest\" or mediator for the other nations (Isaiah 61:6). Among the chief of the nations; rather, because of the chief of the nations. Israel is called the \"chief of the nations\" (so, with a cognate word for \"chief,\" in Amos 6:1) because Jehovah has\" chosen\" it as his peculium (to use the language of the Vulgate), Deuteronomy 7:6, and because no other nation \"hath God so nigh unto them,\" and \"hath statutes and judgments so righteous,\" as Israel (Deuteronomy 4:7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The weakest among the Israelites will share the blessings with the strongest, even the blind and the lame (comp. Isaiah 33:23, \"The lame take the prey\"). Elsewhere we are told that, in the Messianic age, \"the eyes of the blind shall see,\" and \"the lame man shall leap as an hart\" (Isaiah 35:5, 6). Shall return thither; rather, hither; i.e. to Palestine, where Jeremiah writes this prophecy. The word for company is hahal, the proper word in the Pentateuch for the Israelitish national \"congregation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - With weeping; i.e. with a joy dashed with sorrow at the thought of the sin which has rendered such an interposition necessary (comp. Jeremiah 31:18). Cause them to walk by the rivers of waters. The reference here is primarily to the homeward journey of the exiles, which shall be free from the trials of the first Exodus, but not exclusively (see on next verse). The question arises how this prediction is to be reconciled with facts. For, as Kimchi has remarked, we find no reference to miracles performed for the Jews who returned from Babylon. A twofold reply seems admissible. We may say either that to those who enjoy a vivid sense of the favour and protection of God no trial is grievous, no circumstances exclude an undercurrent of joy (comp. Psalm 23.); or that the prophecy is still waiting for its complete fulfilment, Israel having still a great future reserved for it upon its recognition of the true Messiah. In a straight way; or, in an even way, i.e. one free from hindrances. Comp. Ezra's prayer (Ezra 8:21), and Psalm 107:7, in both of which passages \"right\" should probably be \"even.\" Ephraim is my firstborn. It is doubted whether this simply means that Ephraim (i.e. North Israel) shall be in no respect inferior to Judah - a strong form of expression being chosen, on account of the longer continuance of Ephraim's captivity; or whether it implies a restoration to the tribes of Joseph of the prerogative conferred upon the sons of Joseph (1 Chronicles 5:1, 2; comp. Genesis 48:15). The former view seems hardly consistent with the dignity of a prophetic writer. \"Forms of expression,\" i.e. rhetorical phrases, may be admitted in poetical passages, but hardly in solemn prophetic revelations. It was true that Judah had \"prevailed above his brethren;\" but the original \"gift of God\" to Ephraim was \"without repentance.\" With regard to the fulfilment of this prediction, we must remember that the remnant of the northern tribes whose faith was strong enough to induce them to profit by the edict of Cyrus, was smaller than that of the southern. Hence the outward signs of God's favour to Ephraim could not be so great as they would have been had the moral conditions of the fulfilment of the promise been more fully complied with.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The isles; i.e. the distant countries of the West (see on Jeremiah 2:10). So great an event as the restoration of the chosen people would be of worldwide importance. He that scattered Israel will gather him, etc. \"The Israelites were the flock of Jehovah (Psalm 77:20; Psalm 80:1), but during the Captivity a scattered and miserable flock. Jeremiah says that his eye 'shall run down with tears, because the flock of Jehovah is carried away captive' (Jeremiah 13:17). The change in the fortunes of the Jews is compared by the prophets to a shepherd's seeking his lost sheep, and feeding them again in green pastures (Jeremiah 31:10; Jeremiah 1:19; Ezekiel 34:11-16). The reference is not so much to the homeward journey of the exiles as to the state of temporal and spiritual happiness in which they would find themselves on their return. The same figures occur in a psalm, where a reference to the return from exile is excluded by the pre-exile date, '... feed them also, and carry them forever' (Psalm 28:9)\" (from the writer's note on Isaiah 40:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord; i.e. the Ephraimites, after praising God on the holy hill, shall spread themselves over their own territory like an overflowing stream, and enjoy the \"goodness\" or good gifts of Jehovah - the corn (not simply the wheat), the wine, the oil, etc. (comp. Deuteronomy 8:8). Sorrow; rather, languish. As Dr. Payne Smith well says, \"It expresses the poverty and helplessness of exiles unable from homesickness and want of confidence to do anything with spirit. Restored to their homes, they will be as full of vigour as a garden irrigated with water under a Southern sun.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Young and old, men and women, shall give themselves up to joy and merriment, the centre of the mirth being the maidens with the timbrels (ver. 4). Both young men and old together; rather, and young men and old (shall rejoice) together.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And I will satiate; literally, water (same word as in Psalm 36:8). The \"fatness\" means the fat parts of the thank offerings, which were given to the priests (Leviticus 7:34). Satisfied. \"Satiated\" would be a happier rendering. The word is different from that rendered \"satiate\" just above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-22. - From this glorious prospect Jeremiah's eye turns to the melancholy present. The land of Ephraim is orphaned and desolate. The prophet seems to hear Rachel weeping for her banished children, and comforts her with the assurance that they shall yet be restored. For Ephraim has come to repentance, and longs for reconciliation with his God, and God, who has overheard his soliloquy, relents, and comes to meet him with gracious promises. Then another voice is heard summoning Ephraim to prepare for his journey home. This verse is quoted by St. Matthew (Matthew 2:17) with reference to the massacre of the innocents, with τότε ἐπληρώθη prefixed. The latter formula of itself suggests that there was a previous fulfilment of the prophecy, but that the analogy of the circumstances of the innocents justifies - nay, requires - the admission of a second fulfilment. In fact, the promise of the Messianic age seemed in as much danger of being rendered void when Herod wreaked his fury on the children of Bethlehem, as when the tribes of Israel were scattered in exile. Dean Stanley finds a geographical inconsistency in the two passages. \"The context of Jeremiah 31:15 implies that the Ramah of the prophet was in the northern kingdom, probably Ramah of Benjamin. The context of Matthew 2:18, on the other hand, implies that the Ramah of the evangelist was within sight of Bethlehem\" ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 225). But this remark involves the assumption that the quotation was not intended merely as an application. Verse 15. - A voice was heard; rather, is heard. It is a participle, indicating the continuance of the action. In Ramah. In the neighbourhood of which town Rachel was buried, according to 1 Samuel 10:2 (\"the city\" where Samuel and Saul were - 1 Samuel 9:25 - appears to have been Ramah). Rachel weeping for her children. Rachel (\"Rahel\" is only a Germanizing way of writing the name), being the ancestress of the three tribes, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, is represented as feeling like a mother for all the tribes connected with those three. Her \"weeping\" is no mere figure of speech. Jeremiah believes that the patriarchs and holy men of old continue to feel an interest in the fortunes of their descendants (comp. Isaiah 63:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Rachel is admonished to cease from weeping, because her work has not really been in vain; her children shall be restored. Thy work shall be rewarded. Like the Servant of the Lord, Rachel had said (though with the voiceless language of tears), \"I have laboured in vain; I have spent my strength for nought and in vain;\" and like the ocean mother of Zidon, \"I have not travailed, nor brought forth children, neither nourished up young men, nor brought up virgins\" (Isaiah 23:4). Rachel's work had been that of rearing up the patriarchs, \"in whose loins\" the tribes themselves were, in a certain sense. From the land of the enemy; i.e. from the countries of Israel's dispersion. But in the spirit of St. Matthew, we may fill the passage with a higher meaning, of which the prophet (like Shakespeare sometimes) was unconscious, namely, \"from death;\" and the passage thus becomes an undesigned prophecy of the Resurrection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Hope in thine end; rather, hope for thy future (comp. on ch. 29:11). There is no occasion to render, with the Septuagint and Rosenmuller, \"for thy posterity\" (comp. Psalm 119:13, Hebrew); for Rachel identifies herself by sympathy with her descendants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - The ground of this hope, viz. that Ephraim will humble himself with deep contrition. Verse 18. - As a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; literally, as an untaught calf (comp. Hosea 10:11). Turn thou me, etc. Jeremiah has a peculiarly deep view of conversion. Isaiah (Isaiah 1:16-20) simply calls upon his hearers to change their course of life; Jeremiah represents penitent Ephraim as beseeching God so to prepare him that he may indeed \"turn.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - After that I was turned, I repented; rather, after my turning away (as Jeremiah 8:4), I have repented. It is a different kind of \"turning\" which is here meant, a turning away from God. I was instructed; literally, I was made to know; i.e. brought to my senses by punishment. I smote upon my thigh; rather, I have smitten, etc. Ephraim describes his present state of mind, and the symbols by which he translates it into act. Smiting upon the thigh was a sign of mourning (comp. Ezekiel 21:17). I did bear, etc.; rather, I have borne, etc. The \"reproach of Ephraim's youth\" is that which he brought upon himself in early times by his unfaithfulness to Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Divine speaker asks, as it were in surprise, whether Ephraim, who has so flagrantly sinned against him, can really be his dear (or, precious) son, his pleasant child (literally, child of caressing, i.e. one caressed). The latter expression occurs in a remarkable passage of Isaiah (Isaiah 5:7). Since I spake against him; rather, as often as I spake against him; i.e. as often as I pronounced sentence against Ephraim - such a sentence as is recorded in Isaiah 9:8-21 (where the future tenses should he perfects) and Isaiah 28:1-4. We must remember that, with God, to speak is to perform. Often as Jehovah punished Israel, he still remembered him in love - a love which was the pledge of his future restoration to favour upon his true repentance. I do earnestly remember; rather, I verily remembered. \"To remember\" is the Old Testament term for providential care (comp. Genesis 8:1; Genesis 19:29). My bowels are troubled; literally, sound, moan (so Isaiah 16:11; Isaiah 63:15). Something analogous to the thrilling sensation of deep human grief is predicated of Jehovah. Such is the \"humility\" of the God of revelation (Psalm 18:35; comp. Hosea 11:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSet thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Set thee up waymarks. The \"virgin of Israel\" is addressed. She is directed to mark out the road for the returning exiles. The command is obviously the. torical in form; the general sense is that the Israelites are to call to mind the road so familiar to their forefathers, though only known to themselves by tradition. The word rendered \"waymarks\" occurs again in 2 Kings 33:17 and Ezekiel 39:15. It apparently means a stone pillar, which might be used either as a waymark or a sepulchral monument. The high heaps seem to mean much the same thing; \"signposts\" would be a better rendering. Set thine heart toward the highway; rather, turn thy thoughts, etc., for the heart is here evidently the symbol of the intellectual rather than the moral life (comp. 1 Kings 10:2, and many other passages). A passage in the Psalms (Psalm 84:6) will occur to every one, in which a psalmist, longing at a distance for the services of the temple, pronounces blessed the man \"in whose heart are the highways [to Zion];\" here, it is true, \"heart\" has the double meaning of \"mind\" and \"affections,\" but \"highway\" has almost exactly the same sense as in the passage before us. To these thy cities. The unseen speaker is supposed to be in Palestine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - How long wilt thou go about? We must suppose the Israelites to be hesitating whether to set out on their journey or not. They are now admonished to put away their rebellious reluctance, and a special reason for this is added. The Lord hath created - i.e. hath decreed to create - a new thing in the earth (or, in the land); comp. Isaiah 43:19 which suggests that a complete reversal of ordinary experience is indicated, as indeed the word create of itself prepares us to expect. And what is this promise granted as a sign to reluctant Israel? A woman shall compass a man; i.e. instead of shyly keeping aloof, or worse (as hitherto), Israel, Jehovah's bride, shall, with eager affection, press around her Divine husband. The phrase, however, is extremely difficult. Of other explanations, the most plausible philologically is that of Schnurrer and Gesenius, \"a woman shall protect a man\" (comp. Deuteronomy 32:10). The part of a sentinel, pacing round and round his charge, seems most unfitted for a woman. When enemies are abroad, it is the men's natural duty to perform this part for the women. But in the coming age, the country shall be so free from danger that the places of men and women may safely be reversed. But would a paradox of this kind be likely to be uttered in this connection? Surely a clearer statement would be necessary to remove the reluctance of the Israelites. Vers. 19, 20 suggest that Ephraim needed reassurance as to the attitude of Jehovah towards him. The promise of ver. 22, as explained above, would give precisely the needed strength and comfort. The exposition of St. Jerome and other Fathers, that the birth of Christ from a virgin is referred to, is altogether inadmissible,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because the nouns which form the subject and the predicate respectively indicate sex, not age, and the first in particular cannot be tortured so as to mean \"virgin;\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) there is no article to confine the reference to any particular persons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-26. - But the prophet would not have Judah suppose that Ephraim has supplanted her; she too shall be restored, and shall enjoy a happy pastoral and agricultural life. Verse 23. - As yet; rather, again (as ver. 4). Mountain of holiness. Does this mean simply Mount Zion, or the whole highland country of Judah (scrap. Isaiah 11:9)? The former view is the safer; it is by no means clear that \"mountain\" in Isaiah or anywhere else in the Old Testament means the Holy Land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The ideal of outward life exhibited by the prophets is still the agricultural and pastoral. Jeremiah puts this more forcibly than the Authorized Version represents. Instead of, And there shall dwell in Judah, etc., he says, And there shall dwell therein (viz. in the land) Judah and all his cities together as husbandmen, and they shall go about with flocks, i.e. they shall attend to their ancient pursuits without let or hindrance from invaders (comp. Isaiah 32:20). \"Go about\" (literally, break up) is the regular word for the periodical journeying of the nomad life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For Jehovah will have fulfilled every unsatisfied craving. I have satiated (literally, watered) means \"I have decreed to satiate;\" it is the perfect of prophetic certitude, which represents an event as already having taken place in the Divine counsels. Sorrowful; rather, languishing (see on ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Upon this I awaked, etc. Who the speaker is here has been much debated. That Jehovah is meant is not an admissible view. A weak believer may say complainingly, \"Why sleepest thou?\" but God himself cannot be represented under the image of a sleeper. There seems, however, to be no reason why the prophet should not have used this language. The doubt is whether a real, physical sleep is meant, or merely an ecstatic condition resembling sleep. Hengstenberg decides for the latter. But there is no parallel for sleep in the sense of ecstasy, and, on the other hand, there is evidence enough for dreams as the channels of Divine revelation (Genesis 31:10, 11; 1 Kings 3:5; 1 Kings 9:2; Joel 2:28). As Naegelsbach points out, this is the only unqualifiedly comforting prophecy in the whole book, and may well have left a sweet savour in the prophet's memory. Stern, indeed, was the reality which the moment of his waking brought back to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-30. - The physical side of the Messianic blessing. Its effect upon the heart of the pardoned sinners will be such that they will fully recognize the justice of the Divine judgments. There will no longer be any room for a certain favourite proverb; the death of a sinner will be universally acknowledged to be the reward of his personal sin (Keil). Verse 27. - I will sow, etc. The passage may be illustrated by Isaiah 26:18, where the Church of the restored exiles is represented as complaining that the land (of Judah) has not been brought into a state of security, and that inhabitants (in sufficient numbers) have not been begotten. Similarly here, only the tone of complaint is wanting. The thought has suggested itself - Will the Israelites of the latter days be sufficient to fill up the land? Yes, is the answer of revelation; for Jehovah will perform a wonder, and make the people and their cattle so prolific that it will seem as if children and young cattle grew up like plants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - As I have watched... so will I watch, etc. The allusion is to the twofold commission given to the prophet (Jeremiah 1:10), which was partly to pluck up and to destroy, partly to build and to plant. Jehovah has hitherto been \"watchful\" (another point of contact with ch. 1; see on Jeremiah 1:12) over the fulfilment of the destructive prophecies; he will now be equally zealous for that of the promises of regeneration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Have eaten a sour grape; rather, sour grapes. The prophet (like Ezekiel, ch. 18.) condemns the use of this proverb, and declares that the sinner is the artificer of his own ruin. At first sight, it may seem as if Jeremiah opposes the second commandment, which describes how God \"visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children\" (Exodus 20:5). This, however, cannot really be, for he endorses this declaration later on (Jeremiah 32:18). The fact is that he is not so much condemning the proverb, as the blasphemous application of it made by the Jews of his time. It is an eternal truth that sin perpetuates itself (except by the miracles of grace) in the children of transgressors, and intensified sin leads to intensified punishment. But the children of transgressors do not cease to be responsible for their own share in the sin; - this was the truth which Jeremiah's contemporaries ignored. He does not deny the solidarity of the family or the race,but he superadds the neglected truth of the special responsibility of the individual. This is one among many evidences of the deepening sense of individual life in the later period of the Jewish monarchy. (A somewhat different view is offered by Delitzsch, 'Messianic Prophecies,' § 50. According to him, Jeremiah looks forward to a time when the individual shall be liberated from the consequences of his solidarity with his race, and when personality shall be \"invested with its rights.\" But can the individual be thus liberated?)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-34. - The new covenant. A prophecy which stands out from the rest of Jeremiah by its evangelical character, in which it strongly reminds us of parts of the second half of Isaiah. The doctrine of the covenant is \"the thread which binds together the hopes and the fears of the prophet, his certainty of coming woe, his certainty of ultimate blessing.\" A covenant was granted of old, but that covenant had on man's side been broken. Still \"the gifts and calling of God are not to be retracted\" (Romans 11:29); and Jeremiah felt that the very nature of God guaranteed the renewal of the covenant on a new basis. \"Covenant\" is, no doubt, an unfortunate rendering. The Hebrew word so rendered means, primarily, a decision or appointment, and there is a whole group of passages in the Old Testament which requires this meaning (see the present writer's note, in 'The Prophecies of Isaiah,' on Isaiah 42:6). We retain it, however, as that with which the reader is familiar, and only remind him that God is everything, and man nothing, in fixing the terms of the transaction. The characteristics of the new covenant are three:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The relation between God and his people is protected from all risk by God himself making the people what he would have them be.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"Whereas, in the case of the old, the law of duty was written on tables of stone, in the case of the new the law is to be written on the heart; whereas, under the old, owing to the ritual character of the worship, the knowledge of God and his will was a complicated affair, in which men generally were helplessly dependent on a professional class, under the new, the worship of God would be reduced to the simplest spiritual elements, and it would be in every man's power to know God at first hand, the sole requisite for such knowledge as would then be required being a pure heart.\" AndNEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"whereas, under the old, the provisions for the cancelling of sin were very unsatisfactory, and utterly unfit to perfect the worshipper as to conscience, by dealing thoroughly with the problem of guilt, under the new God would grant to his people a real, absolute, and perennial forgiveness, so that the abiding relation between him and them should be as if sin had never existed\" (Dr. A.B. Bruce, in The Expositor, January, 1880, pp. 70, 71). Comp. the abolition of the ark indicated in Jeremiah 3:16. - The inspired author of Hebrews tells us (Hebrews 8:6-13), speaking generally, that this promise delivered through Jeremiah was fulfilled in the gospel. But it must be remembered that the gospel has not yet taken form outwardly, except in a comparatively meagre sense. If the Jews as a nation (that is, the better part or kernel of Israel) should embrace the gospel, not necessarily in the logical expression familiar to the West, but in its essential facts and truths, we should see quite another embodiment of the promise, and feel the spiritual impulse in ourselves as we have not yet done. It seems appropriate, in conclusion, to quote a finely expressed passage from De Quincey's exposition of the New Testament term μετάνοια. Without pledging ourselves to the absolute correctness of his explanation of that word, his language may be well applied to Jeremiah's prophecy. \"What would have been thought of any prophet, if he should have promised to transfigurate the celestial mechanics; if he had said, 'I will create a new pole star, a new zodiac, and new laws of gravitation;' briefly, 'I will make new earth and new heavens'? And yet a thousand times more awful it was to undertake the writing Of new laws upon the spiritual conscience of man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Although I was an husband unto them. The translation of the Septuagint κἀγὼ ἠμέλησα αὐτῶν, is undoubtedly wrong, though adopted for consistency's sake by the author of Hebrews 8:9. The phrase is the same as in Jeremiah 3:14, where even the Septuagint has ἐγὼ κατακυριεύσω ὑμῶνNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - After those days; i.e. after they have fully come; not, after they are over. I will put my law, etc. Of course, not the Pentateuch, but the principles of which the rules in the Pentateuch were the temporary application. It is not here denied that there were, or might be, some under the Old Testament dispensation who had the Divine Law in their heart (see some of the psalms), but speaking of the people as a whole, it must be said that the Law was an external dictator rather than a bosom friend, a mechanical rule rather than a λόγος ἴμφυτος (James 1:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - On this verse, see note on the paragraph.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-37. - Guarantee of Israel's national continuance. A marvellous promise, in the face of the Babylonian Captivity. Verse 35. - The ordinances of the moon; i.e. the moon in its appointed changes (comp. Jeremiah 33:23). Which divideth the sea when, etc.; rather, which stirreth up the sea, so that, etc. This is one of the points of content Jeremiah with the latter part of Isaiah (see Isaiah 51:17; and comp. Job 26:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Thus edith the Lord. \"It is not without meaning that the prophet so frequently repeats: 'Thus saith the Lord.' This formed the Α and Ω; his word was the sole ground of hope for Israel. Apart from it, despair was as reasonable as now it was unreasonable\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38-40. - The connection is not very clear. The main point of these verses is that Jerusalem, when rebuilt, shall be altogether \"the Lord's.\" Its circumference shall even be extended with the single object of including spots at present unclean, but then to become holy like the rest of the city. According to Hengstenberg and Keil, Jerusalem is here a figure of the kingdom of God in the latter days. Verse 38. - The tower of Hananeel. This lay at the northeast corner of the city (Nehemiah 3:1; Nehemiah 12:39). The gate of the corner. At the north, west corner (2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chronicles 26:9). Both this and the tower of Hananeel are mentioned together again in the prophecy of the glorification of Jerusalem, in Zechariah 14:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Over against it upon the hill Gareb; rather, straight forward unto the hill Gareb. The hill of Gareb is not mentioned elsewhere; its meaning is probably \"Leper's Hill.\" It must, of course, have been outside the city, and may be identified (after Schleussner and Hitzig) with \"the fourth hill, which is called Bezetha\" (Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). To Goath; rather, to Goah. But the reading of the Peshito, \"to Gibeah,\" should probably be adopted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah31:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - The southern boundary of the city. The whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes; rather,... even the dead bodies and the ashes. It is assumed by most that Jeremiah means the valley of Hinnom, which, after its defilement by Josiah (2 Kings 23:10), had become a receptacle of rubbish and offal. It is, however, against this view that the word for \"valley\" is not gai (elsewhere connected with Hinnom), but emek, i.e. \"deep lying plain.\" The \"dead bodies\" are the corpses of men and animals, destroyed by the judgment of God, and lying unburied; but where, seems uncertain. Ashes. Wood ashes are not here meant, but those of flesh and fat, which remained after the burning of a sacrificial victim (see Leviticus 1:16; and comp. 4:12). The horse gate. Mentioned in Nehemiah 3:28. Holy unto the Lord. The unclean spots in the neighbourhood having been transformed. The expression reminds us of Exodus 28:36 (the legend on the forefront of the high priest's mitre).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - Time and circumstances of the following revelation. It took place in the tenth year of Zedekiah, the eighteenth of Nebuchadnezzar (comp. Jeremiah 25:1; Jeremiah 52:12). The siege of Jerusalem had Begun in the preceding year (Jeremiah 39:1), but had been temporarily raised on the approach of an Egyptian army (Jeremiah 37:5, 11). Jeremiah, who had declared resistance hopeless, had been accused of treason, and imprisoned (Jeremiah 37:13), and in prison he remained till the close of the siege. Like St. Paul at Rome, however, he was allowed free communication with visitors, as appears from ver. 8 and Jeremiah 38:1. Vers. 2-5 are parenthetical (see on ver. 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - In the court of the prison; or, the court of the guard, which adjoined the royal palace (Nehemiah 3:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Had shut him up. A brief and general account of the circumstances related more in full in ch. 37. For the prophecies referred to, see Jeremiah 34:3-5; Jeremiah 37:17; Jeremiah 38:17-23 (the following verse is almost identical with Jeremiah 34:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Until I visit him; i.e. until I take notice of him. \"To visit\" is used in a good (Jeremiah 27:22; Jeremiah 29:10) as well as in a bad sense (Jeremiah 6:15; Jeremiah 49:8), so that no definite announcement is made respecting Zedekiah's future. There was no object to gain by extending the scope of the revelation beyond the immediate present, and Zedekiah's offences did not require such an anticipative punishment as the clear prediction of the details of his fate (Jeremiah 39:6, 7; Jeremiah 52:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-15. - The purchase of the field. Ver. 6 resumes ver. 1, after the long parenthesis in vers. 2-5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Hanameel. Another form of Hananeel; comp. Γεσάμ, in the Septuagint = Goshen, Μαδιάμ = Midian. In Jeremiah 31:38 the Authorized Version has Hananeel, and the Septuagint Ἀναμεήλ (of course, the persons referred to are different). The son of Shallum thine uncle. It is strange that Hanameel should be called at once Jeremiah's uncle's son and his uncle; and yet this is the case - the former in vers. 8, 9, the latter in ver. 12. There is, therefore, no reason why we should deviate (as most commentators do) from the ordinary Hebrew usage, and suppose \"thine uncle\" in this verse to refer to Shallum, and not rather to Hanameel. But how are we to explain this singular variation in phraseology? Either from the fact that the Hebrew for \"uncle\" is simply a word expressive of affection (it means \"beloved,\" see e.g. Isaiah 5:1), and might, therefore, just as well be applied to a cousin as to an uncle: or else. upon the supposition that the word for \"son (of)\" has fallen out of the text before \"mine uncle,\" both in this verse and in ver. 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The right of inheritance (or rather, of taking possession) is thine. The right, however, was dependent on the previous right of redeeming the land. Hence the speaker continues: The redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. The Law directs, \"If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold\" (Leviticus 25:25). Jeremiah's kinsman, however, ascribes to him the right of pre-emption. This is not mentioned in Leviticus; hut, of course, no one would care to purchase a property till he was sure that the next kinsman would not insist on redeeming it. No one, it may be remarked, could purchase land unconditionally - the usufruct of it till the year of jubilee was all that was legally transferable; and even the original occupant had only a life interest in his land, the ownership of which was, strictly speaking, vested in the commune. This seems to Be the necessary inference from a comprehensive view of the passages relative to land in the Old Testament (see Mr. Fenton's 'Early Hebrew Life; ' and an article in the Church Quarterly Review, July, 1880). Then I knew, etc. We may, perhaps, interpret this notice combined with that in ver. 6 thus: Jeremiah had had a presentiment, founded, perhaps, upon the distress to which his cousin had been reduced, that the latter would invite him to carry out the provisions of the Law; and his presentiments were generally so ordered by the Divine Spirit of prophecy as to be ratified by the event. Still, he had a measure of uncertainty till Hanameel actually came to him, and so demonstrated \"that this had been the word of the Lord.\" In recording the circumstances, he not unnaturally reflects his later feeling of certitude in his description of the presentiment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Seventeen shekels of silver; i.e. about £2 5s. 4d. (taking the shekel at 2s. 8d.). This has been thought a small price. Thirty shekels were paid for the potter's field (Matthew 27:7); fifty by David, for Araunah's threshing floor and oxen (2 Samuel 24:4). The Hebrew has \"seven shekels and ten of silver;\" hence the Targum increases the price by supplying \"minas\" before \"of silver,\" bringing up the sum to one hundred and seven shekels. This, however, seems too much. Even if Jeremiah wished to be liberal, he would hardly have been able to go so far (probably) in excess of the market price. Who would have purchased the land on speculation, if Jeremiah had refused? The famine made life, the siege, a continuance of personal liberty, terribly uncertain. And, putting this out of the question, there may have been but a short time to elapse before the year of jubilee, when the land would revert to its original occupant (see above). The singular form of expression in the Hebrew, at which the Targum stumbled, may, perhaps, be the usual style of legal documents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-14. - The Authorized Version is here so far wrong, on technical terms, that it seems best to retranslate the whole passage: \"And I wrote (the circumstances) in the deed, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance. And I took the purchase deed, that which was sealed (containing the offer and the conditions), and that which was open; and I gave the purchase deed unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah (rather, Makhseiah), in the sight of Hanameel my uncle, and in the sight of the witnesses who subscribed the purchase deed, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. And I charged Baruch before them, saying, Thus saith Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this sealed purchase deed, and this open deed; and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.\" The deed was made in two copies, so that if the open one were lost, or suspected of having been tampered with, an appeal might always be made to the sealed copy. The latter was to be placed in an earthen vessel, to preserve it from injury by damp. It ought to be added that the words in ver. 11, rendered \"containing the offer and the conditions,\" are difficult. \"Containing\" is not expressed in the Hebrew, and \"offer\" is not the ordinary meaning, though etymologically justifiable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I charged Baruch before them, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Shall be possessed; rather, shall be bought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-25. - Jeremiah obeys the Divine command, but is so besieged by misgivings that he applies for a further revelation of God's purposes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAh Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Ah, Lord God! rather, Alas! O Lord Jehovah (as Jeremiah 1:6). Too hard for thee. It is the word usually rendered \"wonderful,\" but rather indicating that thing or person lies outside the common order (comp. Genesis 18:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Into the bosom, etc. The ample dress of an Eastern rendering a bag or basket unnecessary (comp. Ruth 3:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreat in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Even unto this day. A loose expression. Jeremiah simply means that signs and wonders equal to those wrought in Egypt have continued to the present time. And in Israel; rather, both in Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Almost identical with Deuteronomy 26:8. The great terror which the Israelites inspired is constantly referred to (see Deuteronomy 2:25; Exodus 23:27; Joshua 5:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Behold the mounts (see as Jeremiah 6:6). Is given. Resistance being hopeless, Jerusalem was virtually in the hands of its besiegers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For the city is given; rather, whereas. It is a reflection of the prophet's.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-44. - The Divine answer. This falls into two parts. First, Jehovah repeats the burden of so many prophecies, that Israel has only to blame himself for his punishment (vers. 26-35); and then a bright future is disclosed beyond the gloomy interval of conquest and captivity - a future when men shall buy fields, and comply with all the legal formalities, precisely as Jeremiah has done (vers. 36-44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - I will give; rather, I am on the point of giving (present participle).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And burn it. A still more significant prediction to Jewish hearers than to us, for it implies that Jerusalem had become utterly rebellious, and deserved the punishment of the old Canaanitish cities. It was to be made a cherem (Deuteronomy 3:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - From their youth (see on Jeremiah 3:24, 25; 22:21). The children of Israel, in the first half of the verse, must have a narrower sense than in the second half. The fall of Jerusalem is the climax of the series of punishments which the two separated and yet (in God's sight) united portions of the people of Israel have had to undergo.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - From the day that they built it. It is useless to tell an impassioned orator that his words are not strictly consistent with primitive history. The Israelites may not have built Jerusalem, but Jeremiah was not to be debarred from the strongest form of expression open to him for such a reason. He means \"from the earliest times.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - Repeated, with slight variations, from Jeremiah 7:30, 31. \"Baal\" and \"Molech\" are identified as in Jeremiah 19:5 ( = Jeremiah 7:31), and even more distinctly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And now therefore. This introduces the strange and lovely contrast to the gloomy picture which has gone before. It will be observed that there is no direct reference to Jerusalem, but the capital was only emphasized before as the heart of the nation, and it would, of course, be no comfort to say that Jerusalem's inhabitants (alone) would be restored.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be my people, and I will be their God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - One heart, and one way. Unity is always given as the \"note\" of the ideal, Messianic period (comp. Zephaniah 3:9; Zechariah 14:9; John 10:16). That they may fear me forever. This reminds us of a phrase in the exhortation in Deuteronomy 4:10, as the next clause does of Deuteronomy 6:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - An everlasting covenant. It is the \"new covenant\" of Jeremiah 31:31, etc., which is meant (for the phrase, comp. Isaiah 55:3; Ezekiel 37:26). That I will not turn... to do them good.

We must then continue \"in this country,\" and in ver. 44, \"men shall buy lands.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah32:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Subscribe evidences; rather, write (particulars of their purchase)in the deed (as ver. 10). In the land of Benjamin, etc. The catalogue of the districts of the Jewish kingdom heightens the realistic effect (see on Jeremiah 17:26). Everywhere the old social system will be reproduced in its entirety.

It was needless to express the object of the verbs. Jehovah's great purpose is the regeneration of his people. To \"frame\" or \"form\" is synonomous with \"purpose\" (see on. Jeremiah 38:11). The meaning of the verse is that Jehovah's very Name is a pledge of his fidelity to his promises (comp. Jeremiah 32:18). To \"establish\" is synonymous with \"to carry out.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCall unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Mighty things; rather, secret things (literally, inaccessible). It must be admitted that this introduction hardly corresponds to the sequel, which does not contain any special secrets, as we should have thought. Either vers. 2, 3 have been inserted by a later (inspired) editor, whose mind was absorbed in high thoughts of the latter days - for this view may be urged the style and phraseology, which are hardly those of the surrounding chapters, hardly those of Jeremiah; or else we must adopt Hengstenberg's perhaps over subtle suggestion, which, however, does not touch the question of the phraseology, \"that throughout Scripture dead knowledge is not regarded as knowledge; that the hope of restoration had, in the natural man, in the prophet, as well as in all believers, an enemy who strove to darken and extinguish it; that therefore it was ever new,\" or, in the words of Jeremiah, \"great and secret things, which thou knowest not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-9. - The houses of Jerusalem, destroyed by the engines of the besiegers or filled with dead bodies, shall be restored; the captives shall be brought back; their sins shall be forgiven, and God be glorified.

The Septuagint omits \"they come,\" but the passage still remains enigmatical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will bring it health and cure, etc. \"Health\" is properly the fresh skin which grows over a healing wound (as Jeremiah 8:22; Jeremiah 30:17). First the city is spoken of, then its inhabitants. Will reveal unto them; or perhaps, will roll unto them (comp. Jeremiah 11:20; Jeremiah 20:12). In this case the figure will be that of a mighty stream (comp. Amos 5:24; Isaiah 48:18; Isaiah 66:12). Truth; rather, continuance (comp. Jeremiah 14:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will cause the captivity... to return (see on Jeremiah 29:14).

For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The sacrifice of praise (see on Jeremiah 17:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - An habitation; rather, a pasture (including the idea of an encampment). The expression reminds us of Jeremiah 23:3, 4, but it is preferable to take the present passage in its literal sense rather than as metaphorical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - In the cities, etc. A parallel description to Jeremiah 17:26; Jeremiah 32:44.

In particular it is urged that the promise of a multitude of Levites and of descendants of David is isolated among the prophecies of Jeremiah, who elsewhere speaks of a single great representative of David as the object of pious hope, and of the intercourse between Jehovah and his people as being closer and more immediate than under the old Law. A variation in the form of expressing the Messianic hope is, however, not of much importance. Isaiah, for instance, sometimes refers to a single ideal king (Isaiah 9:6, etc.); sometimes to a succession of noble, God-fearing kings (Isaiah 32:1; Isaiah 33:17). Verse 14. - That good thing which I have promised; viz. in the parallel passage, Jeremiah 23:5, 6 (which see).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The Branch of righteousness; rather, the Plant of righteousness (see on Jeremiah 23:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Wherewith she shall be called; viz. Jerusalem; in Jeremiah 23:6, the parallel passage, the subject is \"Israel,\" unless there is a corruption of the text. The Lord our righteousness; rather, The Lord (is) our righteousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - David shall never want a man, etc. This is, in fact, a republication of the promise given by Nathan in 2 Samuel 7:12-16. It agrees in form with the announcements in 1 Kings 2:4; 1 Kings 8:25; 1 Kings 9:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Neither shall the priests the Levites, etc. It has Been thought that this passage is inconsistent with the prophecies of a time when the ark should no more be remembered (Jeremiah 3:16), and when all should know Jehovah from the least to the greatest (Jeremiah 31:34). But though sin offerings would in this glorious time become things of the past, yet thank offerings are expressly excepted from abolition (ver. 11), and in Jeremiah 31:14 a special latter-day promise is given to the priests. Moreover, Ezekiel, who repeats the prophecy of the new spiritual covenant (Ezekiel 11:19; Ezekiel 36:26; Ezekiel 37:26), gives an elaborate sketch of a new temple with a sacrificial system (ch. 40, etc.); and, if there is any inconsistency, we find the same one in the latter part of Isaiah. In Isaiah 61:6 the whole regenerate people of Israel is called \"the priests of Jehovah;\" but in Isaiah 66:21 the prophet distinctly states that there will be, in some sense, a priestly class within the chosen people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-22. - The constant, regular succession of day and night is an emblem of the equally regular supply of royal descendants of David and of Levitical priests, and the countless grains of sand are symbolic of the wonderful increase of their numbers. At first sight the latter part of the promise seems a little unlike a blessing. But we have seen already (on Jeremiah 19:3) that the members of the various branches of the royal family probably occupied the principal offices of the state, and the prophet imagines the future in forms borrowed from the present. A numerous sacerdotal class seemed equally necessary for the due magnificence of the ritual; and we must remember that preternatural fertility of the soil was a standing element of Messianic descriptions. The expressions used are, no doubt, hyperbolical, but the meaning seems clear enough. (Hengstenberg's notion, that the prophet rather indicates the abolition of the royal and sacerdotal distinctions (comp. Exodus 19:6), is surely very far fetched.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-26. - The permanence of Israel as the people of God, with rulers of the house of David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConsiderest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - This people; i.e. not Egyptians or Babylonians (as some have supposed), but the people of Judah, regarded as alienated from Jehovah (hence the touch of disparagement), as elsewhere in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 4:10, 11; Jeremiah 5:14, 23; Jeremiah 6:19; Jeremiah 7:33, etc.). There were unworthy Jews, who, seeing their nation fallen from its high estate, despaired of its deliverance and regeneration. That they should be no more, etc.; rather, so that they are no more a people - no more an independent people The \"two families,\" of course, are the \"two houses of Israel\" (Isaiah 8:14), i.e. the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah33:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - All the kingdoms of the earth; etc.; rather, of the land. The accumulation of phrases is to convey the composite character of the Chaldean army. And against all the cities thereof; i.e. the fortified cities which still held out - against Lachish and Azekah, if no more (per. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - (Getup. these verses with Jeremiah 32:3-5.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Yet hear the word of the Lord, etc. Clearly this introduces a limitation of the foregoing threat. Zedekiah will, it is true, be carried to Babylon, but he will not suffer a violent death; he will \"die in peace,\" and be buried with all customary royal honours. A difficulty, however, has been felt in admitting this view. How could Zedekiah be said to die in peace, when he was \"in prison till the day of his death\" (Jeremiah 52:11)? and how could the deposed king of a captive people be honoured with a public mourning? The reply isNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that, as compared with a cruel death by flaying or impalement, it was \"peace\" to live in the obscure quiet of a prison; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that, as the Jews appear to have been left very much to themselves (see Ezekiel, passim), it is credible enough that they were allowed to show the customary honours to a deceased representative of David. At any rate, the alternative view seems not in accordance with sound exegesis, viz. that the verse means this, \"If thou obey the word of the Lord, and surrender thyself to Nebuchadnezzar, thou shalt live and die in peaceable possession of the throne.\" What parallel can be produced for this violent interpretation?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - With the burnings of thy fathers. It was customary to burn spices at royal funerals (2 Chronicles 16:14; 2 Chronicles 21:19). Saying, Ah lord! (see on Jeremiah 22:18). The second of the group of prophecies in Jeremiah 34, 35. is composed of vers. 8-22. It contains a denunciation of the Jews who, at the beginning of the siege, had emancipated their Hebrew slaves (according to Exodus 21:1-4; Deuteronomy 15:12), but after the withdrawal of the Chaldeans had resumed possession of them. Ver. 21 is couched in a form which indicates the precise date of the prophecy, viz. before the Chaldeans returned to renew the siege of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - A covenant. The scene of this \"covenant\" was the temple (veto. 15, 18). Solemn agreements of this kind were not uncommon (comp. 2 Chronicles 15:12; 2 Kings 11:17; 2 Kings 23:3; Nehemiah 10.). To proclaim liberty unto them. The phrase, a very peculiar one, is taken from the law of jubilee (Leviticus 25:10), though the prescription on which the covenant was based refers exclusively to the seventh year of the slave's servitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Should serve himself of them; literally, should work through them; i.e. \"should employ them for forced labour;\" as in Jeremiah 25:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Now when all the princes, etc. This verse should rather be rendered thus: Then all the princes, and all the people, etc., obeyed, every one letting his slave, and every one his handmaid, go free, not serving them. selves of them any more; they even obeyed, and let them go.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Out of the house of bondmen. Egypt had been a \"house of bondmen\" to their fathers (Exodus 13:3; Deuteronomy 6:12, and elsewhere); let them not make the holy city thus grievous to those who were equally with themselves children of Jehovah's redeemed ones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - At the end of seven years, etc. This is the literal rendering, but the sense, as is clear from the parallel passage in Deuteronomy 15:12, and indeed from the next clause of this very verse, is \"in the seventh (not, the eighth) year.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Ye were now turned; or, ye returned (the primary meaning is simply \"to turn;\" henceNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to turn away, as in ver. 16;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to return, as here; comp.

Judah is henceforth to be \"lord of himself - that heritage of woe;\" or rather, he is to become the slave of Sword, Pestilence, and Famine. The \"liberty\" now proclaimed does not profit Judah, who so much desires it. I will make you to be removed; rather, I will make you a shuddering (as Jeremiah 15:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - When they out the calf in twain, etc. This clause should be translated differently, and placed, for clearness, in a parenthesis (the calf which they cut in twain, and between the parts of which they passed). The division of the calf might, in fact, be called in Hebrew either \"the covenant\" or \"the token of the covenant\" (comp. Genesis 17:10, 11). It was a solemn assurance that he who should transgress God's Law should share the same fate as the victim. The same idea seems to have dictated the Hebrew phrase, \"to cut a covenant,\" and the Greek and Latin equivalents (ὅρκια τέμνειν: foedus icere); comp. the parallel narrative in Genesis 15:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And their dead bodies, etc. One of Jeremiah's repetitions (see Jeremiah 7:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah34:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And Zedekiah... and his princes. Graf infers from the separate mention of the king and his princes that these had themselves been unfaithful to the covenant. But the threat in this verse seems merely intended to enforce the preceding one by specializing the most prominent sufferers. Parallel passage: Jeremiah 21:7.

From a notice in 1 Chronicles 2:55 it appears that the Rechabites were a subdivision of the Kenites, the nomad tribe so closely connected with the Israelites (Judges 1:16; Judges 4:18-22; comp. Numbers 10:29), especially with the tribe of Judah (1 Samuel 27:10; 1 Samuel 30:29). The names of Jonadab and of Jaazaniah and his progenitors (which include the sacred Name), together with the zeal of Jonadab for the worship of Jehovah (2 Kings 10:15, 23), seem to indicate that the religion of the Rechabites approximated closely to that of the Israelites. There seem, in fact, to have been two branches of the Kenites - one having Edomitish, the other Israelitish, affinities. Records of the former still exist in the Sinaitic inscriptions, and in the Arabian histories; indeed, there is still a tribe called Benu-l-Qain (often contracted into Belqein) in the Belqa (the ancient land of Ammon); and it would seem that there is an Arab tribe in Arabia Petraea, eastward of Kerak, which traces itself to Heber the Kenite. and goes by the name of Yehud Chebr, though it now denies any connection with Jews. There were also Jews of Khaibar, near Mecca, who played an important part in the early history of Islam (see further 'Zeitschr. der deutschen morgenland. Gesellschaft,' 8:706; 14:438; 28:568, 571). Into one of the chambers. There were many \"chambers\" of different sizes attached to the temple, and employed partly for stores, partly for councils and assemblies, partly for guard chambers, and other official purposes (comp. 1 Chronicles 28:12; Ezekiel 40:17). In Jeremiah 36:10 we even find a private person occupying one of the \"chambers.\" That into which Jeremiah conducted the Rechabites was, no doubt, one of the largest size; it was appropriated to the use of a single priestly family - the \"sons of Hanan\" (ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A man of God. The title, according to Hebrew usage, belongs to Hanan, not to his father, and means \"prophet\" (see e.g. 1 Kings 12:22); comp.

Maaseiah the son of Shallum. Probably the father of Zephaniah, \"the second [or, 'deputy'] priest\" (Jeremiah 52:24), himself a functionary of high rank, as he is called a keeper of the door (or rather, threshold). There were three of these \"keepers,\" corresponding to the number of the gates of the temple, and they ranked immediately after the high priest and his deputy (Jeremiah 52:24); comp.\" I had rather be a doorkeeper,\" etc., in one of the Korahite psalms (Psalm 84:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Pots full of wine; rather, bowls, large round vessels (crateres), out of which the drinking cups were filled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Jonadab the son of Rechab our father. Jonadab (the contemporary of King Jehu) is here called the \"father\" of the Rechabites (comp. vers. 14, 16), in the same sense in which the disciples of the prophets are called the \"sons of the prophets;\" he was a teacher, if not (in some sense) a prophet. This illustrates the uncompromising zeal of Jonadab in 2 Kings 10:23; the religion of Baal was probably at the opposite pole in the matter of luxury to that of Jehovah as practised by Jonadab.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Not for you the lifeNEWLINEOf sloth and ease within the city's gates,NEWLINEWhere idol feasts are held, and incense smokesNEWLINETo Baalim and Ashtaroth; where manNEWLINELoses his manhood, and the scoffers sitNEWLINEPerverting judgment, selfish, soft, impure.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Plumptre.) Ye shall drink no wine, etc. The Rechabites were, in fact, typical Arabs. The Wahhabee movement, in our own century, may be taken as partly parallel, though, of course, a settled life is not one of the abominations of the neo-orthodox Islam. A still more complete parallel is given by Diodorus Siculus (19:94), who states it to be the law of the Nabataeans, \"neither to sow corn, nor to plant any fruit-bearing herb, nor to drink wine, nor to prepare houses,\" and gives as the motive of this the preservation of their independence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And for fear of the army of the Syrians. We are expressly told in 2 Kings 24:2 that, after the rebellion of Jehoiakim, \"bands of Syrians\" made incursions into Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Then came the word of the Lord, etc. The substance of the severe address which follows must have been delivered in one of the outer courts of the temple, when Jeremiah had left the Rechabites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Because, etc. This rendering is against Hebrew usage, and any reader will see that the obedience of the Rechabites stands in no inner connection with the sentence pronounced upon Judah. Ver. 16 is rather an emphatic recapitulation of what has preceded. It runs literally, (I say) that the sons of Jonadab have performed, etc., but (that) this people hath not hearkened unto me; or, in more English phraseology, \"Yea, the sons of Jonadab,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - A promise to the Rechabites (perhaps removed from its original connection). The form of the promise is remarkable; it runs, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever. The phrase is, as Dr. Plumptre remarks, \"all but essentially liturgical. It is used of the Levites (Deuteronomy 10:8; Deuteronomy 18:5, 7), of the worship of the patriarchs (Genesis 19:27), of the priests (1 Kings 8:11; 2 Chronicles 29:11; Nehemiah 7:65), of prophets (1 Kings 18:15), of priests and Levites together (Psalm 134:1; Psalm 135:2).\" It is, however, rash, perhaps, to maintain, with the same acute scholar, that the Rechabites were adopted into the tribe of Levi. The phrase may be simply chosen to indicate the singular favour with which Jehovah regarded the Rechabites - a favour only to be compared to that accorded to his most honoured servants among the Israelites - the patriarchs, the priests, and the prophets.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah35:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.36":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Baruch. Already mentioned as Jeremiah's attendant, in Jeremiah 32:12. He appears to have been of high rank (see on ver. 15), as Josephus, indeed, expressly states ('Ant.,' 10:09, 1). Maaseiah, his grandfather, was governor of the city (2 Chronicles 34:8), and Seraiah his brother (Jeremiah 51:59) held some equally honourable, though not so easily definable, position in the court.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I am shut up. Not so; Jeremiah was not detained by material force. Some strong reason he had (perhaps of a ceremonial kind), but as it was irrelevant to the narrative, it is not given. Render, I am detained (same verb as in 1 Samuel 21:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Upon the fasting day. The mention of the fast day suggests that ver. 9 is out of its place, which again confirms the view that the narrative before us has received its present form from an editor. In the ears of all Judah (see ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They will present their supplication; literally, their supplication will fall (as margin). The phrase seems to be suggested by the gesture of a suppliant. Hence humility is one idea; but success is entirely another. That which lights down before one's eyes cannot be disregarded. Hence, in Jeremiah 37:20 and Jeremiah 42:2, the Authorized Version renders, \"be accepted.\" This is, at any rate, a better rendering than that quoted above, which is both weak in itself and obscures the connection. And will return; rather, so that they return. \"Returning,\" i.e. repentance, is necessary, because their \"evil ways\" have provoked Jehovah to \"great anger and fury;\" but is only possible by the Divine help (comp. Acts 5:31, \"To give repentance unto Israel\"). Hence prayer is the first duty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In the fifth year of Jehoiakim. It is remarkable that the Septuagint has here the eighth year; and Josephus, too, relates that Jehoiakim paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar in his eighth year. This latter statement seems to tally with the notices in 2 Kings 24. The vassalage of Jehoiakim is there said to have lasted three years; this followed the rebellion; while the siege of Jerusalem was reserved for the short reign of Jehoiachin. Now, as this siege must have been the punishment of Jehoiakim's rebellion, and as the reign of the latter king lasted eleven years, we are brought to the same date as that given by Josephus for the commencement of the vassalage, viz. the eighth year. It is to this year, then, that 2 Kings 24:1 refers when it says, \"In his days Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant;\" and also the narrative before us in the statement that \"they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.\" What other event would have produced such a concourse of worshippers? The battle of Carchemish (which took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim)? But it was by no means clear as yet that the consequences of this would be disastrous for Judah. Carchemish was too far off for the people of Judah to show such serious alarm (similarly Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' etc., vol. 23. p. 300). If so, Jeremiah kept his prophecy by him for several years, till the fight moment came. The ninth month. As this is a winter month (see ver. 22), Jeremiah evidently reckons by the Babylonian calendar, the ninth month of which, Kisiluv (Hebrew, Chisleu), began from the new moon of December.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The chamber (see on Jeremiah 35:4) of Genesisariah...the scribe. Genesisariah was favourably disposed to Jeremiah (ver. 25); he was probably the brother of Jeremiah's friend, Ahikam (Jeremiah 26:24). He was one of the royal secretaries, and reckoned among the \"princes\" (see ver. 12). In the higher court. \"Higher\" equivalent to \"inner.\" The new gate (see on Jeremiah 20:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He went down (see on Jeremiah 26:10). Sat there. In deliberation on the affairs of the state. Elishama the scribe. Gemariah, then, had a colleague. So in Solomon's cabinet (if the word may be used) there were two soferim, or secretaries, one perhaps for the civil and one for the military business (1 Kings 4:3; comp, Jeremiah 52:25). Elnathan. Mentioned already, Jeremiah 26:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Jehudi... the son of Cushi. A genealogy which contains a history. Jehudi is not a true proper name, any more than Gadi (\"a Gadite\"), the quasi-name of the father of Menahem (2 Kings 15:14), or than Cushi, the quasi-name of Jehudi's great-grandfather. Cushi himself was, doubtless, an Ethiopian, and probably (like Ebed-melech, Jeremiah 38:7) a eunuch, or at least chamberlain; his son and grandson were both worshippers of Jehovah (as their names indicate), but were not qualified to become Jewish citizens. The Egyptian was not, indeed, to be abhorred, but not until the third generation could his descendants be admitted into\" the congregation\" (Deuteronomy 23:8). Egypt and Ethiopia were historically connected (see Lenormant's 'Ancient History,' index to vol. 1.). For the name of \"Jehudi,\" comp. \"Jehudith,\" daughter of Beeri the Hittite (Genesis 26:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Sit down now. The princes evidently recognize Baruch as belonging to a family of distinction (see on ver. 4); and from vers. 19, 25 we may infer that they were favourably inclined beth to Baruch and to his master (comp. ch. 26.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They were afraid both one and other; rather, they turned shudderingly one to another. Such an announcement as Jeremiah's at such a serious crisis startled them by its boldness. We may infer that the prophet had for some time, by Divine command, kept his sombre anticipations in the background. We will surely tell the king; rather, we have to tell the king. Friendly feeling would have prompted them to hush up the affair (see Jeremiah 27:20, 21), but duty forbade.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - How didst thou write all these words at his mouth! Two questions seem to be combined here - \"How didst thou write all these words?\" and \"Didst thou write it all at his mouth?\" Baruch's answer is good for both.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He pronounced, etc.; rather, He kept dictating... while I wrote with ink, etc. The addition of the last clause suggests (and was, perhaps, intended to do so) that Baruch's function was simply mechanical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Into the court; i.e. into the inner court, in which the royal apartments were apparently situated (comp. 1 Kings 7:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Which stood beside the king; literally,...above the king. The standing courtiers, of course, rose above the king; comp. Isaiah 6:2, \"Seraphim stood above him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In the winter house; i.e. that part of the royal palace (beth, house, may also be rendered apartment) which was arranged for a winter habitation (comp. Amos 3:15). According to Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 309), the more airy part of a house is called \"summerhouse,\" and the more sheltered room \"winter house.\" The ninth month, in which the events now being related took place, corresponded approximately to our December. It was, therefore, the cold and rainy season; December is a stormy month in Palestine. A fire on the hearth; rather, in the chafing dish (or, brazier). It was a vessel with live coals placed in the centre of the room, still used in the East in cold weather.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Three or four leaves; rather, columns or compartments. \"Leaves\" would imply that it was a book out of which Jehudi read, Whereas it was a roll (m'gillah never has any other meaning). But \"books\" were not yet known, nor would a knife have been necessary to separate the pages. He cut it. The subject may be either the king or Jehudi (at the bidding of the king). The term implies that the action of cutting was repeated several times; but we are not to suppose that each successive portion was cut off as it was read. The indignation of the hearer translated itself into the repeated mutilation of the roll, until all the roll was (east into the fire and) consumed. With the penknife; literally, with the scribe's knife. On the hearth; rather, in the chafing dish (or, brazier).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Yet they were not afraid. Unlike Josiah (2 Kings 22:11), and even Ahab (1 Kings, 21:27). Nor any of his servants; i.e. the courtiers, as opposed to the \"princes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The son of Hammelech; rather, a royal prince (we should render similarly in Jeremiah 38:6; 1 Kings 22:26; 2 Kings 11:1, 2; Zephaniah 1:8). We have seen already that the number of such royal princes was very large (see on Jeremiah 17:9); any one, in fact, who had a king among his ancestors was a \"royal prince.\" The Lord hid them; i.e. saved them from discovery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-32. - Punishment denounced against Jehoiakim, and second writing of the former prophecy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Thou shalt say to Jehoiakim; rather, concerning Jehoiakim. Intercourse between Jehoiakim and the prophet was broken off by the preceding scene. The speech begins in the oratio directa, but soon passes into the obliqua. Cause to cease... man and beast. A forcible description of the completeness of the devastation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - He shall have none to sit, etc. Substantially a repetition of the prophecy in Jeremiah 22:18, 19 (comp. 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah36:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - I will bring upon them, etc. (comp.

This was Zedekiah's second embassy to Jeremiah. His request on the former occasion bad been for a prophecy; on the present it was for an \"effectual fervent prayer,\" such as Hezekiah's embassy asked of Isaiah (Isaiah 37:6).

His interference was useless; indeed, Hophra was one of the most unfortunate of the Egyptian kings (see Jeremiah 44:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Even if the Jews had defeated the whole Chaldean army, and there remained but a group of sorely wounded men, these in their weakness would be enabled to carry out God's sure purpose. But wounded men hardly brings out the force of the Hebrew; the word rendered \"men\" is emphatic, and expresses paucity of numbers, and that rendered \"wounded\" is, literally, pierced through.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For fear of, etc.; rather, because of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - As soon as communication with the outside world was possible, Jeremiah took the opportunity of going to his native country, to obtain something or other which he could only obtain \"thence.\" The Authorized Version says that his object was to separate himself thence. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the rendering is linguistically untenable; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the assumed object is incongruous with the circumstances and Character of Jeremiah, who was neither inclined to seek safety in isolation nor had any motive at present for doing so. The only safe rendering is, to claim his share thence. Whether there was just then a reallotment of communal lands must be left undecided; this would, however, be the most plausible hypothesis, if we could be sure that the present was a sabbatical year. The additional words, in the midst of the people, would then acquire a special significance. The \"people\" would be the representatives of families who had an equal right to allotments with Jeremiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The gate of Benjamin; i.e. the gate looking northwards towards Benjamin (comp. Jeremiah 20:2; Jeremiah 38:7; Zechariah 14:10). It appears to be the same as the gate of Ephraim (2 Kings 14:13; Nehemiah 8:16). Thou fallest away, etc. Perhaps an allusion to Jeremiah's declaration (Jeremiah 21:9) that \"he that falleth away to the Chaldeans... he shall live,\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The princes were wroth with Jeremiah. As Graf has pointed out, the princes, who had evinced their respect for Jeremiah on former occasions (ch. 26, 36.) had probably shared the captivity of Jehoiachin; Zedekiah's \"princes\" would be of a lower origin and type, and ready (like the judges in the French \"terror\") to accept any charge against an unpopular person without proper examination. The house of Jonathan the scribe. \"Scribe,\" i.e. one of the secretaries of state. The house of Jonathan seems to have been specially adapted for a prison, as the next verse shows. Chardin, the old traveller, remarks, \"The Eastern prisons are not public buildings erected for that purpose, but a part of the house in which the criminal judges dwell. As the governor and provost of a town, or the captain of the watch, imprison such as are accused in their own houses, they set apart a canton of them for that purpose when they are put into these offices, and choose for the jailor the most proper person they can find of their domestics\" (Chardin).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Into the dungeon, and into the cabins. The former word undoubtedly implies an underground excavation. The latter is of more uncertain signification. It most probably means \"vaults;\" but it may mean \"curved posts\" - something analogous to stocks (see on Jeremiah 20:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Meantime the Chaldean army has returned, and reinvested the city. Zedekiah, in his anxiety, sends for Jeremiah privately to his palace. Thou shalt be delivered, etc. (comp. Jeremiah 32:3, 4; Jeremiah 34:2, 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah37:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Court of the prison; rather, court of the watch (as Jeremiah 32:2). A piece of bread; literally, a circle (i.e. round cake) of bread. This is mentioned elsewhere in descriptions of poverty (1 Samuel 2:36; Proverbs 6:26); but as the ancient Oriental bread was not our delicate white bread, it was a real \"staff of life.\" The Syrian peasants still eat cakes of coarse meal, of about the thickness of parchment, and equal in size to a large plate (Orelli's 'Travels'). The bakers' street. Probably the several trades were confined to special quarters and streets. In Cairo each trade has still its own bazaar (saddlers, carpets, hardware, goldsmiths, sweetmeats, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.38":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Two Pashurs appear to be mentioned here: one probably the same who put Jeremiah in the stocks (Jeremiah 20:1, 2); the other a member of the first of Zedekiah's two embassies to the prophet (Jeremiah 21:1). On Jucal, see Jeremiah 37:3. Had spoken; rather, kept speaking.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - He that remaineth, etc. Jeremiah repeats what he had said to Zedekiah's embassy in Jeremiah 21:9, 10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For thus; literally, for therefore; i.e. because he is left in impunity (camp. the use of the phrase in Jeremiah 29:28). He weakeneth the hands of the men of war; i.e. he dispirits them. It is important to get this \"outside view\" of the preaching of Jeremiah. There is evidently some excuse for the opponents of Jeremiah. It was a matter of life and death to resist the Chaldeans, and Jeremiah was, according to the politicians, playing into the hands of the enemy (see further in general Introduction). The addition of the words, that remain, shows that the bitter end of the resistance was fast approaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He is in your hand. The growing power of the \"princes\" (see on Jeremiah 22:4) seems to have confined the king to a merely secondary role.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The dungeon; more literally, the cistern. \"Every house in Jerusalem was supplied with a subterranean cistern, so well constructed that we never read of the city suffering in a siege from want of water\" (Dr. Payne Smith). A grotto bearing the name of Jeremiah has been shown at Jerusalem since the fifteenth century. Under its floor are vast cisterns, the deepest of which professes to be the prison into which the prophet was thrown. The objection is that the sacred narrative proves that the prison was in the city, whereas \"the present grotto was not included within the walls until the time of Herod Agrippa\" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1881, p. 555). The son of Hammelech; rather, a royal prince (as Jeremiah 36:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Ebed-melech the Ethiopian. The name means \"the king's slave.\" Ebers remarks that the eunuchs employed are those on whom the shameful operation has been performed by Copts in Upper Egypt. Zedekiah's harem is referred to in vers. 22, 23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEbedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For there is no more bread in the city. It would almost seem as if the little remaining bread had been brought together by command of the magistrates, and that it was given out in rations by them (comp. Jeremiah 37:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thirty men. Why so many were sent is not clear. Are we to suppose that the princes would resist Jeremiah's release? But \"the king is not he,\" etc. (ver. 5). Is it not a scribe's error for \"three\" (so Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Under the treasury; rather, to (a room) under the treasury. Old cast clouts, etc.; literally, rags of torn garments and rags of worn-out garments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The third entry. What this means exactly is not clear; probably the \"entry\" led from the palace to the temple. It must have been a private place, else it would not have been chosen for this interview. I will ask thee a thing; rather, I will ask of thee a word; i.e. a revelation from Jehovah (comp. Jeremiah 37:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Wilt thou not hearken; rather, thou wilt not hearken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - That made us this soul. A very unusual formula (comp. Isaiah 57:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The king of Babylon's princes. Nebuchadnezzar himself was in Riblah (Jeremiah 39:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - All the women that are left; i.e. probably the wives of Zedekiah's royal predecessors, who had passed into his own harem as concubines. Even Hezekiah, as Payne Smith well points out, had a numerous harem ('Records of the Past,' 1:39, where \"daughters\" is equivalent to \"girls\"). Zedekiah's own wives are spoken of in the next verse. Thy friends have set thee on, etc. The first half of this taunting song (mashal) reminds of Obadiah 1:7 (for other points of contact with Obadiah, see on Jeremiah 49:7-22). The meaning is that, after urging the weak-minded Zedekiah on to a conflict with the Chaldeans, they have left him involved in hopeless difficulties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - So they, etc.; rather, and they, etc. The women spoken of are different from those in ver. 22. Thou shalt cause this city to be burned. The literal rendering (see margin) is, Thou shalt burn this city; but the Septuagint, Peshito, and Targum have \"As for this city it shall be burned,\" which suits the parallelism better.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He told them according to all these words. A controversy has arisen as to whether Jeremiah was justified in concealing the truth. But is a man bound to confess the truth to a murderer?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah38:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And he was there when, etc. The words, of which this is an incorrect version, ought to begin the first verse of the next chapter. Render (with Coverdale), And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken (in the ninth year of Zedekiah came Nebuchadrezzar, etc.; in the eleventh year...the city was cleft open) that all the princes, etc. The correctness of the reading is, however, open to some doubt (see introduction to next chapter)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.39":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And all the princes, etc.; rather, That all the princes, etc. (see on Jeremiah 38:28). The fact mentioned in this verse is not recorded in 2 Kings 25; ch. 52; and its preciseness is a considerable pledge of its accuracy. The princes are four in number, and two of them have official titles attached. Nergal-sharezer is the Hebraized form of Nirgal-sarra-ucur, i.e. \"Nirgal (or Nergal), protect (or perhaps, has created) the king\" - the name, as often, is a prayer. Samgar-nebo is probably a modification of Sumgir-nabu, \"Be gracious, Nebo;\" but it has not yet been found in the inscriptions. Sarsechim has the appearance of being corrupt; the first part, however, may, perhaps, be the Babylonian for \"king\" (\"prince\" in Hebrew). Rab-saris has a meaning in Hebrew - \"chief of the eunuchs;\" but the analogies of \"Rab-mag\" and \"Rab-shakeh\" suggest that it is merely the Hebraized form of some Assyrian title. In any case, it would be better to render \"the Rab-saris,\" and to attach it closely to the preceding name, Sarsechim being himself the official called Rab-saris (see, however, ver. 13). Rab-mag. This was \"one of the highest titles in the state\" (G. Smith). The etymology of the latter half of the phrase is uncertain; for the connection of \"mag\" with \"Magi\" is a mistake which has been exposed by Dr. Schrader, in his work, 'Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament' (of which a translation is announced). The native form of the name may be rubu emga (Schrader) or rubu makhe (Friedr. Delitzsch), and the whole title will mean \"high priest\" or \"chief of the sorcerers\" (comp. Delitzsch, \"The Hebrew Language viewed in the Light of Assyrian Research,\" Lond., 1883, p. 14). \"The Rab-mag\" would be more accurate, and the title ought to be attached to the preceding name, Nergal-sharezer. As a matter of fact, a Nirgal-sarra-ucur, who held the office of rubu emga, is mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions, and we may plausibly conjecture that he is the person here mentioned among the \"princes.\" He was afterwards raised to the throne by the conspirators who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar (he is better known as Neriglissar). It is singular that two Nergal-sharezers should be here mentioned; possibly the first mention is due to a mistake. The names are hardly recognizable in the Septuagint. The \"princes\" took up their station in the middle gate. The \"breach\" spoken of in ver. 2 enabled the Babylonians to occupy the whole of the lower city to the northeast of Zion. The \"middle gate\" probably separated these two parts of Jerusalem, and those who were posted there commanded the temple and the citadel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Here begins the second parenthesis, to be read apart from the principal, though shorter, narrative (see introduction to chapter). Observe elsewhere in the Book of Jeremiah events known from other sources are only briefly referred to (comp. Jeremiah 29:2; Jeremiah 32:1-5; Jeremiah 34:1, 7; Jeremiah 35:11; Jeremiah 37:5); see 2 Kings 25:4-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Nebuzar-adan; i.e. Nabu-zira-iddina, \"Nebo gave a seed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Nebushasban. The name occurs in a list of proper names, under the form Nabu-sizibanni, \"Nebo, rescue me!\" It is remarkable that a different name is given to the Rab-saris in ver. 3; and the conjecture is not unreasonable that Sarsechim is a corruption of the latter part of the name Nebushasban. In ver. 3 the Septuagint has Nabusachar instead of Sarsechim (other copies read Nabusarsechim).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Gedaliah, whose father had already befriended the prophet on a serious occasion (Jeremiah 26:24), and who, according to Jeremiah 40:5, had been appointed (though himself a Jew) Babylonian \"governor over the cities of Judah,\" is directed to carry him (Jeremiah) home, or rather, into the house; obviously some house close by is meant - either Gedaliah's temporary dwelling or the royal palace. This statement conflicts (see introduction) with that in Jeremiah 40:1-5, but only as to the time when Jeremiah was liberated. The latter narrative being more explicit, deserves the preference. Thus Jeremiah dwelt among the people; i.e. could go in and out at his pleasure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah39:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - A prophecy to Ebed-melech is here introduced, which, though uttered previously (see ch. 38.), could not have been mentioned before without breaking the sequence of events.

Hitzig, for instance, followed by Dr. Payne Smith, thinks that \"saying\" may be an unusual equivalent for \"that is to say,\" \"for example,\" or the like; while the Vulgate and Rashi, followed by De Wette and Rosenmüller, assume an ellipsis, and render, \"It is commonly said,\" or \"I might say.\" But far the most natural way is to suppose that \"saying\" is a fragment of the superscription of the prophecy, the remainder of which has been accidentally placed in ver. 6, and that we should read, \"And the word of the Lord came unto me in the days of Josiah the king, saying.\" So J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Graf, Naegelsbach. If a man put away his wife. The argument is founded on the law of Deuteronomy 24:1-4, which forbade an Israelite who had divorced his wife to take her again, if in the interval she had been married to another. The Jews had broken a still more sacred tie, not once only, but repeatedly; they worshipped \"gods many and lords many;\" so that they had no longer any claim on Jehovah in virtue of his \"covenant\" with his people. Shall he return, etc.? rather, Ought he to return? The force of the term is potential (comp. Authorized Version of Genesis 34:7, \"which thing ought not to be done\"). Shall not in the next clause is rather would not. Yet return again to me. So Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and the view may seem to be confirmed by the invitations in vers. 12, 14, 22. But as it is obviously inconsistent with the argument of the verse, and as the verb may equally well be the infinitive or the imperative, most recent commentators render, \"And thinkest thou to return to me?\" (literally, and returning to me! implying that the very idea is inconceivable). Probably Jeremiah was aware that many of the Jews were dissatisfied with the religious condition of the nation (comp. ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Lift up thine eyes, etc. No superficial reformation can be called \"returning to Jehovah.\" The prophet, therefore, holds up the mirror to the sinful practices which a sincere repentance must extinguish. The high places; rather, the bare hills (comp. on Jeremiah 2:20). In the ways hast thou sat for them. By the roadside (comp. Genesis 38:14; Proverbs 7:12). As the Arabian in the wilderness. So early was the reputation of the Bedouin already won (comp. Judges 6.).

Wilt thou not, etc.? rather, Truly from this time thou callest unto me (literally, Dost thou not, etc.? a common way of giving an energetic assurance). The prophet admits the apparent revival of faith in Jehovah which attended the compulsory reformation under Josiah, but denies that it was more than apparent (comp, ver. 10). The guide of my youth; rather, the companion (the familiar associate); so in Proverbs 2:17. Comp. Jeremiah 2:2, and especially Isaiah 54:6, \"and a wife of youth\" (i.e. married in youth), \"that she should be rejected [how incredible a thing!]\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Will he reserve? rather, Will he retain, etc.? It is a continuation of the supposed address of Judah. To the end? rather, everlastingly? Behold, thou hast spoken, etc.; rather, Behold, thou hast spoken it, but hast done these evil things, and hast prevailed (i.e. succeeded). The substance of the two verses (4 and 5) is well given by Ewald: \"Unhappily her power truly to return has been exhausted, as not long ago after fresh signs of the Divine displeasure she prayed in beautiful language to [Jehovah] for new favor and abatement of the old sufferings, [but] she immediately fell again into her sin, and carried it out with cool determination.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord said also unto me, etc. It has been suggested (see on ver. 1) that this introductory clause belongs rather to ver. 1. Some sort of introduction, however, seems called for; Ewald supposes a shorter form, such as \"And the Lord said further unto me.\" The view is not improbable, for although there is evidently a break between ver. 5 and ver. 6, there are points of contact enough between vers. 1-5 and the following discourse to prove that they represent the same prophetic period (comp. ver. 10 with ver. 3, vers. 8, 9 with ver. 1, ver. 12 with ver. 5, ver. 19 with ver. 4). Backsliding Israel; literally, apostasy Israel. Usually a change or modification of a name is a sign of honor; here, however, it marks the disgrace of the bearer. Israel is apostasy personified (comp. vers. 14, 22). She is gone up; rather, her wont hath been to go up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And I said after she had done, etc.; rather, and I said, After she hath done all these things, she will return unto me. And her treacherous sister. Observe the distinction between the two sisters. Israel had openly broken the political and religious connection with Jehovah (Hosea 8:4); Judah nominally retained both, but her heart was towards the false gods (comp. the allegory in Ezekiel 23, which is evidently founded upon our passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And I saw, when for all the causes, etc.; rather, and I saw that even because apostate Israel had, etc. But this is exceedingly strange in this connection. The preceding words seem to compel us either (with the Vulgate) to omit \"and I saw\" altogether, or (with Ewald) to read the first letter of the verb differently, and render \"and she saw,\" taking up the statement of ver. 7 (\"saw; yea, she saw,\" etc.). The latter view is favored by a phrase in ver. 10 (see note below). The same corruption of the text (which is palaeographically an easy one) occurs probably in Ezekiel 23:13. The error must, however, be a very ancient one, for the Septuagint already has καὶ εῖδον.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Through the lightness of her whoredom; i.e. through the slight importance which she attached to her whoredom. So apparently the ancient versions. The only sense, however, which the word kol ever has in Hebrew is not \"lightness,\" but \"sound,\" \"voice,\" and perhaps \"rumor\" (Genesis 45:16). Hence it is more strictly accurate to render \"through the cry.\" etc. (comp. Genesis 4:10; Genesis 19:13), or \"through the fame,\" etc. (as Authorized Version, margin). But neither of these seems quite suitable to the context, and if, as King James's translators seem to have felt it necessary to do, we desert the faithful translation, and enter on the path of conjecture, why not emend kol into klon (there is no vav, and such fragments of true readings are not altogether uncommon in the Hebrew text), which at once yields a good meaning - \"through the disgrace of her whoredom ?\" Ewald thinks that kol may be taken in the sense of k'lon; but this is really more arbitrary than emending the text. With stones, etc. (see Jeremiah 2:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For all this; i.e. though Judah had seen the punishment of apostate Israel (Jeremiah 3:7, 8). So Rashi, Naegelsbach, Payne Smith. Most commentators suppose the phrase to refer to Judah's obstinate wickedness (ver. 9), but this gives a weak sense. \"Judah defiled the land, etc., and yet notwithstanding her repentance was insincere\" - this is by no means a natural sequence of ideas. The right exposition increases the probability of the correction proposed at the beginning of ver. 8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - It is very noteworthy that Jeremiah should have still so warm a feeling for the exiles of the northern kingdom (more than a hundred years after the great catastrophe). Hath justified herself. \"To justify\" can mean \"to show one's self righteous,\" as well as \"to make one's self righteous,\" just as \"to sanctify\" can mean, \"to show one's self holy\" (Isaiah 8:13), as well as \"to make one's self holy.\" In spite of Israel's apostasy, she has shown herself less worthy of punishment than Judah, who has had before her the warning lesson of Israel's example, and who has been guilty of the most hateful of all sins, hypocrisy (comp. ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Israel, therefore, shall be recalled from exile. Her sins are less than those of Judah, and how long and bitterly has she suffered for them! Toward the north. For Israel had been carried captive into the regions to the north of the Assyrian empire (2 Kings 17:6; 2 Kings 18:11). Comp. the pro-raise in Jeremiah 31:8. I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you; rather, my face to fall towards you (i.e. upon your return).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This condition of restoration to favor. Israel is to acknowledge, or perceive, notice, recognize, her guilt. And hast scattered thy ways; alluding to that \"gadding about\" in quest of foreign alliances, reproved in the preceding chapter (Jeremiah 2:36). Comp. \"interlacing her ways,\" Jeremiah 2:23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Turn, O backsliding children. There is a play upon words, or rather upon senses, in the original, \"Turn, ye turned away ones\" (comp. ver. 12). To whom is this addressed? To the Israelites in the narrower sense, for there is nothing to indicate a transition. Long as they have been removed from the paternal hearth, they are still \"sons.\" For I am married unto you. The same Hebrew phrase occurs in Jeremiah 31:32. Its signification has been a subject of dispute. From the supposed necessities of exegesis in Jeremiah 31:32, some (e.g. Pococke and Gesenins) have translated, \"for I have rejected you,\" but the connection requires not \"for\" but \"though,\" which, however, is an inadmissible rendering; besides, the Hebrew verb in question nowhere has the sense of \"reject\" elsewhere (yet the Septuagint already has it, virtually at least, in Jeremiah 31:32, q.v.). The literal meaning is for I have been a lord over you, i.e. a husband. Israel is despondent, and fears to return. Jehovah repeats his invitation, assuring Israel that he does not regard the marriage bond as broken. He is still (in spite of ver. 8) the husband, and Israel the bride (comp. Hosea 2; Isaiah 1:1; Isaiah 54:6, etc.). One of a city, and two of a family. The promises of God are primarily to communities, but this does not prevent him from devoting the most special care to individuals. \"One of a city, and two of a family,\" even though there should be but one faithful Lot in a city, and two such in a family (larger than a city, a single tribe containing only a few mishpa-khoth, or clans), yet I will admit these few to the promised blessings.\" Calvin's remark is worth noticing: \"Hie locus dignus est observatu, quia ostendit Deus non esse, cur alii alios expectent; deinde etiam si corpus ipsum populi putreseat in suis peccatis, tamen si pauci ad ipsum redeant, se illis etiam fore placabilem.\" The historical facts to which the prophecy corresponds are variously regarded. Theodoret, Grotius, etc., suppose it to have been fulfilled exclusively in the return from Babylon; St. Jerome and others think rather of the Messianic period. Hengstenberg finds a continuous fulfillment, beginning at the time of Cyrus, when many belonging to the ten tribes joined themselves to the returning Judahites. He finds a further continuation in the times of the Maccabees, and in fact a continually growing fulfillment in preparation for that complete one brought in by Christ, when the premised blessings were poured out upon the whole δωδεκάφυλον (Luke 2:36). \"Zion and the holy land were at that time the seat of the kingdom of God, so that the return to the latter was inseparable from the return to the former.\" Dr. Guthe, however, the latest critical commentator on Jeremiah, thinks that the passage can be explained otherwise, viz.\" from each city one by one, and from each family two by two.\" This gives a more obvious explanation; but the ordinary rendering is more natural, and the explanation based upon it is in the highest degree worthy of the Divine subject. The doubt, of course, is whether in the Old Testament a special providence is extended elsewhere so distinctly to the individual. But Jeremiah is pre-eminently an individualizing prophet; he feels the depth and reality of individual as opposed to corporate life as no one else among the prophets. (At any rate, one point is clear, that the prophet foresees that the number of the exiles who return will be but small compared with the increase to be divinely vouchsafed to them; see ver. 16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Pastors. In Jeremiah 23:4, the same word is rendered in the Authorized Version \"shepherds,\" which would he less open to misunderstanding here than \"pastors,\" civil and not spiritual authorities being intended (see on Jeremiah 2:8). The prophecy is, of course, not inconsistent with passages like Jeremiah 23:5, but as the national continuance of Israel was guaranteed, it was natural to refer to the subordinate civil authorities. According to mine heart; better, according to my mind; for here, as also in 1 Samuel 13:14, it is something very far from perfection which is ascribed to the chosen rulers. \"Heart\" is sometimes equivalent to \"understanding.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - When ye be multiplied; a common feature in pictures of the latter days (Jeremiah 23:3; Ezekiel 36:11; Hosea 2:1). They shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord. A definition of the Messianic period on its negative side - the ark shall he no longer the center of religious worship. We must remember that the ark is represented in the Law as the throne of Jehovah, who was \"enthroned upon the cherubim\" on the lid of the ark. It is in virtue of this sacramental presence that the temple is called the \"dwelling-places\" of Jehovah (e.g. Psalm 46:4; Psalm 84:1, where Authorized Version has wrongly \"tabernacles\"). Now, in the Messianic period the consciousness of Jehovah's presence was to be so widely spread, at any rate in the center of God's kingdom, the holy city, that the ark would no longer be thought of; it would be, if not destroyed (we know, as a matter of fact, that the ark was destroyed in some unrecorded way), yet at least become utterly unimportant. Jerusalem would then naturally succeed to the title \"Jehovah's throne\" (applied to the temple in Jeremiah 14:12). Neither shall it come to mind. The same phrase is used of the old heaven and earth as compared with the new (Isaiah 65:17). In the concluding clauses, \"visit\" should rather be \"miss,\" and \"that be done\" should be \"it [viz. the ark] be made.\" On the whole subject of the prophetic descriptions of the worship of the Messianic period - descriptions which often wear at any rate a superficial appearance of inconsistency, see the luminous remarks of Professor Riehm, 'Messianic Prophecy,' pp. 161-163. At the same time, we must be extremely cautious how far we admit that Old Testament prophecies of the latter days have received a complete fulfillment in the Christian Church, considering how far the latter is from the realizable ideal, and also the importance attached in the New Testament as well as in the Old to the continuance of Israel as a nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Jerusalem's spiritual glory. With Jeremiah's description, comp. that of Ezekiel,\" The name of the city from that day shall be, \"The Lord is there\" (Ezekiel 48:35). This gives us the positive aspect of the Messianic period (comp. on ver. 16). Jerusalem shall be the spiritual center of the universe, because it is pervaded by the presence of the Most High (comp. Isaiah 4:5). May we explain with Dr. Payne Smith, \"Jerusalem, i.e. the Christian Church?\" Only if the provisional character of the existing Church be kept well in view. All the nations; i.e. all except the chosen people. The word for \"nations\" (goyim) is that often rendered \"heathen.\" To the name; or, because of the name, i.e. because Jehovah has revealed his name at Jerusalem. The phrase occurs again with a commentary in Joshua 9:9, \"Thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt.\" But we must not suppose that \"name\" is equivalent to \"revelation;\" rather, there is here an ellipsis - \"because of the name\" is equivalent to \"because of the revelation of the name,\" or better still, \"... of the Name.\" The \"Name of Jehovah\" is in fact a distinct hypostasis in the Divine Being; no mere personification of the Divine attributes (as the commentators are fond of saying), but (in the theological sense) a Person. The term, \"Name of such and such a God,:' is common to Hebrew with Phoenician religion. In the famous inscription of Eshmunazar, King of Zidon, Ashtoreth is called \"Name of Baal;\" and to whichever proper name the religious term Name may be attached, it means a personal existence in the Divine nature, specially related to the world of humanity; or, to use the language of Hengstenberg, the bridge between the latter and the transcendent heights of God as he is in himself. In short, the Name of Jehovah is virtually identical with the Logos of St. John, or the second Person in the blessed Trinity. Hence the personal language now and again used of this Name in the Old Testament, e.g. Isaiah 30:27, \"The Name of Jehovah cometh from far... his lips are full of indignation;\" Isaiah 26:8,\" The desire of our soul was to thy Name;\" Isaiah 59:19, \"So shall they fear the Name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun.\" Comp. also Proverbs 18:10; men do not run for safety to an abstract idea. Nor will all nations in the latter days resort either to a localized or to a spiritually diffused Jerusalem in the future, to gratify a refined intellectual curiosity. Neither shall they walk, etc.; i.e. the Israelites of the latter days; not the \"nations\" before mentioned (as Hengstenberg). The phrase occurs eight times in Jeremiah, and is always used of the Israelites. The word rendered \"imagination\" is peculiar (sheri-ruth). As Hengstenberg has pointed out, it occurs independently only in a single passage (Deuteronomy 29:18); for in Psalm 81:13, it is plainly derived, not from the living language, from which it had disappeared, but from the written. (The close phraseological affinity between the Books of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah has been already indicated.) The rendering of the Authorized Version, which is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, is certainly wrong; the Vulgate has pravitatum; the etymological meaning is \"stubbornness.\" The error of the versions may perhaps have arisen out of a faulty inference from Psalm 81:13, where it stands in parallelism to \"their counsels.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The reunion of the separated portions of the nation (comp. Ezekiel 37:16, 17; Hosea 1:11; Isaiah 11:12, 13). Observe, Israel is converted first, then Judah. This detail in the prophecy is not to be pressed. Not that the force of any prophecy is to be evaded, but that in this case the form of the statement is so clearly conditioned by the abounding sympathy of the prophet for the ten tribes. These had been so long languishing in captivity that they needed a special premise. The form of the promise is imaginative; this seems clearly to follow from the fact that in no other passage (except, indeed, Jeremiah 31:9) is there a reference to the spiritual primacy of Etihraim in the restored nation. Out of the land of the north; i.e. Assyria and (Jeremiah 1:14) Babylonia. The Septuagint inserts, \"and from all the countries,\" agreeably to Jeremiah 16:15; Jeremiah 23:3; Jeremiah 32:37. Of course, it would not be an accurate statement that the exiles from Judah were confined to \"the land of the north.\" This is a fair specimen of the supplementing tendency of the Septuagint, though it is possible, and even probable, that the Hebrew text has suffered in a less degree from the same tendency on the part of later copyists.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The concluding words of the last verse have turned the current of the prophet's thoughts. \"Unto your fathers.\" Yes; how bright the prospect when that ideal of Israel was framed in the Divine counsels! Condescending accommodation to human modes of thought; But I said fails to represent the relation of this verse to the preceding. Render, I indeed had said, and continue, How will I, etc. Put thee among the children. This is a very common rendering, but of doubtful correctness. It assumes that, from the point of view adopted (under Divine guidance) in the prophecies of Jeremiah, the various heathen nations were in the relation of sons to Jehovah. This is most improbable; indeed, even Exodus 4:22 does not really favor the doctrine of the universal fatherhood of God in the fullest sense of the word. Moreover, the pronoun rendered \"thee\" is in the feminine, indicating that the prophet has still in his mind the picture of Israel as Jehovah's bride. It would surely be an absurd statement that Jehovah would put his bride among the children! Render, therefore, How will I found thee with sons! comparing, for the use of the Hebrew verb, 1 Samuel 2:8, and for that of the preposition, Isaiah 54:11. It is, in fact, the familiar figure by which a family or a nation is likened to a building (\"house of Abraham,\" \"of Israel\"). Jehovah's purpose had been to make Abraham's seed as the dust of the earth (Genesis 13:16). Instead of that, the restored exiles would be few, and weak in proportion, so that the Jewish Church of the early restoration period is represented as complaining, \"We made not the land salvation, neither were inhabitants of the world produced\" (Isaiah 26:18). A special Divine promise was needed to surmount this grave difficulty. A goodly... nations; rather, a heritage the most glorious among the nations. So in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 20:6, 15) Palestine is described as \"the glory of all lands.\" The want of irrigation, and the denudation of the land, have no doubt much diminished the natural beauty and fertility of Palestine; but wherever moderate care is bestowed on the soil, how well it rewards it! Thou shalt call me... shalt not turn; rather, thou wilt call me... wilt not turn. It is the continuation of Jehovah's ideal for Israel. In response to his loving gifts, Israel would surely recognize him as her Father, and devote to him all her energies in willing obedience. Father is here used, not in the spiritual and individualizing sense of the New Testament, but in such a sense as a member of a primitive Israelitish family, in which the pairia potestas was fully carried out, could realize. The first instance of the individualizing use of the term is in Ecclus. 23:1-4. (For the Old Testament use, comp. Isaiah 1:2; Isaiah 63:16; Exodus 4:22; Hosea 11:1.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Surely. The word acquires an adversative sense from the context, as in Isaiah 53:4, and is virtually equivalent to \"but surely.\" From her husband; literally, from her friend or companion. The choice of the word seems to indicate the inner hollowness of the married life. The woman only sees in her husband the companion, behind whoso back she can follow her own inclinations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Another of those rapid transitions so common in emotional writing like Jeremiah's. The prophet cannot bear to dwell upon the backsliding of his people. He knows the elements of good which still survive, and by faith sees them developed, through the teaching of God's good providence, into a fruitful repentance. How graphic is the description! On the very high places (or rather, bare, treeless heights or downs, as ver. 2) where a licentious idolatry used to be practiced, a sound is heard (render so, not was heard) - the sound of the loud and audible weeping of an impulsive Eastern people (comp. Jeremiah 7:29). For they have; this evidently gives the reason of the bitter lamentation; render, because they have.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReturn, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Return, ye backsliding children, etc.; more literally, Turn, ye turned-away sons; I will heal your turnings (as Hosea 14:4). It seems strange at first sight that this verso does not stand before ver. 21. But the truth is that ver. 21 describes not so much the \"conversion\" of the Jews as their willingness to \"convert\" (an archaism of King James's Bible, which we may well regret), or \"turn\" to God. Christ must touch, or at least make his presence felt, in order that the sick man may be healed; a special call of God must be heard, in order that the sinner may truly repent. Behold, we come unto thee. Efficacious, and not \"irresistible\" grace, is the doctrine of the Old Testament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTruly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Truly in vain, etc. An obscure and (if corruption exists anywhere) corrupt passage, which, however, it is hopeless to attempt to emend, as the corruption consists partly in wrong letters, partly in omitted letters or words (or both); and, moreover, the text employed by the Septuagint appears to have presented the same difficulty. The latter point is especially noteworthy. It is far from proving that the traditional text is correct; what it does suggest is that the writings of the prophets were at first written down in a very insecure manner. The rendering of the Authorized Version is substantially that of Hitzig, who explains \"the multitude of [the] mountains,\" as meaning \"the multitude of gods worshipped on the mountains\" -too forced an expression for so simple a context. It seems most natural to suppose (with Ewald, Graf, and Keil), a contrast between the wild, noisy cultus of idolatrous religions, and the quiet spiritual worship inculcated by the prophets. Compare by way of illustration, the loud and ostentatious demonstrations of Baal's ritual in 1 Kings 18, with the sober, serious attitude of Elijah in the same chapter. The word rendered in the Authorized Version \"multitude\" has a still more obvious and original meaning, viz. \"tumult;\" and probably the Targum is not far from the true sense in rendering, \"In vain have we worshipped upon the hills and not for profit have we raised a tumult on the mountains.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - For shame; rather, and the Shame (i.e. the Baal). The words Bosheth (\"Shame\") and Baal are frequently interchanged; so again in Jeremiah 11:13 (comp. Hosea 9:10). So, too, Jerubbesheth stands for Jerubbaal (2 Samuel 11:21; comp. Judges 6:32); Ishbosheth for Eshbaal (2 Samuel 2:8; comp. 1 Chronicles 8:33). Hath devoured the labor of our fathers, etc.; a condensed way of saying that Baal-worship has brought the judgments' of God upon us,, our flocks, and herds, and all the other labor (or rather \"wealth;' i.e. fruit of labor) of our fathers, being destroyed as the punishment of our sins (comp. Deuteronomy 28:30-32). Another view is that the \"devouring\" had to do with the sacrifices, but it is improbable that the sacrificial worship of Baal bad developed to such a portentous extent, and the former explanation is in itself more suitable to the context.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - We lie down; rather, Let us lie down; said in despair, just as Hezekiah says, \"Let us enter the gates of Sheol\" (Isaiah 38:10). A prostrate position is the natural expression of deep sorrow (2 Samuel 12:16; 2 Samuel 13:31; 1 Kings 21:4). Our confusion covereth us; rather, Let our confusion (or reproach) cover us (like a veil) (comp. Jeremiah 51:51; Psalm 69:7).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.40":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - The liberation of Jeremiah. Verse 1. - The word that came to Jeremiah. The formula seems to announce a prophecy; but no prophecy follows. It is not allowable to suppose, with Keil and others, that \"the word\" describes the entire body of prophetic utterance in ch. 40-45. (in spite of the fact that ch. 44. and 45. have special headings). The use would be unexampled; and a prologue of forty verses (see Jeremiah 42:7) is equally contrary to prophetic analogy. Apparently the \"word,\" or prophecy, which originally followed the heading has been lost or removed to some other place. Had let him go from Ramah. Here is an apparent discrepancy with the account in Jeremiah 39:14. The brevity of the latter seems to account for it. No doubt the more precise statement in our passage is to be followed. After the capture of the city, a number of captives, including Jeremiah, were probably conducted to Ramah (see on Jeremiah 31:15), where they had to wait for the royal decision as to their fate. Jeremiah, however, had already been in custody in the \"court of the watch,\" and the writer of Jeremiah 29:14 simply omits the second stage of his captivity (Keil). In chains. See ver. 4, \"The chains which were upon thine hand.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3.

So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Now while he was not yet, etc. This rendering, however, seems against the Hebrew usage. Two renderings are open to us.NEWLINENEWLINE1. \"But since one returneth not from Babylon, then go back to Gedaliah,\" etc.; so Hitzig.NEWLINENEWLINE2.

Verse 7. - In the fields; rather, in the field; i.e. in the open country, as opposed to the towns. Men, and women, and children. Old and worn out men, helpless widows, and fatherless children. Royal princesses were among them (Jeremiah 41:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Jonathan. This name is omitted in the parallel passage (2 Kings 25:23), and by the Septuagint here. It may, of course, be a corruption of Johanan, as Ewald supposes. If so, we must read \"son\" for \"sons,\" with Septuagint. The Netophathite. Netophah was in the neighbourhood of Benjamin. The son of a Maachathite; rather, the Maachathite. Maachah was a Syrian district in the neighbourhood of Hermon (Deuteronomy 3:14; Joshua 12:5). Jezaniah was, therefore, a naturalized foreigner, like Doeg the Edomite (Hitzig).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - To serve the Chaldeans; rather, to stand before the Chaldeans (so literally); i.e. to mediate between you and them (comp. Jeremiah 15:1). Gather ye wine, etc. It was the fifth or sixth month (comp. Jeremiah 41:1; 2 Kings 25:8), the end of July or the beginning of August, when grapes, figs, and olives become ripe. Observe, \"wine\" is here the wine in the grape; the Hebrew yayin seems originally to have meant a cluster of grapes, like the corresponding word (wain) in Arabic (setup. on ch. 48:33). That ye have taken; rather, that ye shall have taken.

But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Baalis the king of the Ammonites. Perhaps the same king referred to in Jeremiah 27:3 as seeking alliance with Zedekiah. He was naturally opposed to the Babylonian official, Gedaliah. Hath sent Ishmael. Ishmael was connected with the royal family (Jeremiah 41:1), and was probably jealous of Gedaliah.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah40:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.41":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - Assassination of Gedaliah and other Jews. Verse 1. - In the seventh month; i.e. two months after the destruction of Jerusalem and the appointment of Gedaliah. It seems strange, however, that the occurrences related in ch. 40. and 41. should have taken so short a time. Gratz calls in question the accuracy of the chronological statement. He quotes Ezekiel 33:24-29, which shows that at least six months (according to his calculation) after the fall of Jerusalem Jewish fugitives still lingered on, and hoped to obtain possession of their fatherland, and points out that time was necessary for Gedaliah to erect a temple at Mizpah (see on ver. 5), for cities to arise out of their ruins, and for cultivation of the soil to be resumed (Jeremiah 40:10). Besides, according to Jeremiah 52:30, a third deportation of Jews is mentioned. How can this be accounted for, if, only two months after the fall of Jerusalem, the remnant of the Jewish population emigrated under Johanan ben Kareah to Egypt? Gratz shows reason for thinking that this last deportation stands in close connection with Gedaliah's death, and that consequently the interval between this latter event and the fall of Jerusalem lasted, not two months, but five years. The son of Elishama. Perhaps the Elishama men. tioned in Jeremiah 36:12 as a secretary of state; or perhaps a son of David of that name (see 2 Samuel 5:18; 1 Chronicles 3:8; 1 Chronicles 14:7; \"son\" being taken here in a wider sense). And the princes of the king; rather, and (one of) the princes of the king. Even ten men; rather, and ten men. Elevon determined bravoes overpower a crowd of unprepared men. Did eat bread together. Gedaliah, then, had invited them to a friendly banquet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Smote Gedaliah. The day of the murder of Gedaliah (the third day of the seventh month) was kept as a fast day by the post-Captivity Jews (see Zechariah 7:5; Zechariah 8:19). It was the day on which the hope of living a separate life in the promised land, for a time at least, vanished; and the murder was avenged by a new captivity (see above).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIshmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Chaldeans. Gedaliah's Chaldean bodyguard. And the men of war; rather, even the men of war. Jewish as well as Chaldean warriors are meant; the non-military Jews, including the prophet, were carried away captive (see vers. 10,16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - The news of the deed of violence had not yet been spread, and Ishmael seized the opportunity of imbruing his hands in fresh blood. He could have had no personal motive; but his employer, Baalis, desired that \"the remnant in Judah might perish\" (Jeremiah 40:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - There came certain from Shechem, etc. A number of pious pilgrims, descend. ants of the old ten tribes, passed by on their way to the holy site of the temple at Jerusalem (?) (comp. 2 Chronicles 34:9; 2 Chronicles 30:11). From Shiloh. The Vatican Codex of the Septuagint has a plausible reading, \"from Salem,\" which is apparently supported by Genesis 33:18, \"And Jacob cares to Shalem, a city of Shechem,\" and by its improvement thus introduced into the geographical order (Shiloh is, in fact, nearer to Mizpah than Shechem, and ought to be mentioned first). But though there is now a village called Salim, to the east of Nablus (Shechem), we have no sufficient ground for assuming a city of that name in the Old Testament, The rendering of Genesis, i.e. needs correction (\"came in peace to the city,\" etc.) Their beards shaven, etc. They had, then, all the outward signs of mourning (for the public calamities); comp, Jeremiah 16:6; Jeremiah 48:37. To bring them to the house of the Lord. Yet the temple at Jerusalem was destroyed. Hence Thenius and Gratz have conjectured that Gedaliah had erected a provisional temple at Mizpah, which was already hallowed by its association with the Prophet Samuel. This is confirmed by 1 Macc. 3:46, where it is said of the pious Jews in the Maccabean rising, that they \"assembled themselves... and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Weeping all along as he went. To testify his sympathy with their grief. But the reading of the Septuagint is more natural, \"As they were going along and weeping.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The pit (see on ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Slay us not, etc. Bishop Callaway refers to this passage in his 'Zulu Nursery Tales' (1:242), in illustration of a Zulu form of deprecating death on the ground of having some important work in hand which absolutely requires the life of the person in danger. But the \"ten men\" do not, as the bishop supposes, beg their lives on the ground that they had not yet harvested, but rather offer a bribe. We have treasures (literally, hidden things) in the field. The allusion is to the \"wells or cisterns for grain,\" in which \"the farmers store their crops of all kinds after the grain is threshed and winnowed. These cisterns are cool, perfectly dry, and tight. The top is hermetically sealed with plaster, and covered with a deep bed of earth; and thus they keep out rats, mice, and even ants, the latter by no means a contemptible enemy .... These ten men had doubtless thus hid their treasures to avoid being plundered in that time of utter lawlessness\" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 509). Honey. Probably that obtained from wild bees.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now the pit... which Arm the king had made, etc. Nothing is said of this \"pit\" in the historical books, but only (1 Kings 15:22 = 2 Chronicles 16:6) that Asa used the material with which Baasha had fortified Ramah to build Geba and Mizpah. It would seem that this \"pit\" formed part of Asa's defensive works; probably it was a cistern to supply the town with water during the siege. Because of Gedaliah; was it. The rendering \"because of\" must be abandoned. The Septuagint has, in this part of the verse, the very natural words, \"was a great pit,\" and this reading is adopted by Movers, Hitzig, and Graft.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The king's daughters; rather, the royal princesses (see on Jeremiah 36:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-18. - Rescue of the captives from Ishmael, and plan for taking flight to Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The great waters.., in Gibeon; i.e. the pool mentioned in 2 Samuel 2:13. Dr. Thomson (p. 670) speaks of a \"pond or small lake\" near El-Jib. Ishmael seems to be lingering over his journey to Ammon, in order to find the subterranean stores spoken of in ver. 8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Cast about; i.e. turned about (an archaism).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And dwelt in the habitation of Chimham. Chimham was the son of the rich Gileadite Barzillai (2 Samuel 19:37-40), who probably founded this \"habitation\" or rather \"hospice\" (\"khan,\" \"caravanserai\"), for the accommodation of travellers - a characteristic mark of public-spirited liberality. Josephus and Aquila, however, appear to have read \"by the hurdles of Chimham\" - a very possible name for a locality in such a pastoral country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah41:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Because of the Chaldeans. They were afraid of being held responsible for the crime of Ishmael. And they had good reason for their alarm, as the Chaldeans would naturally look upon Ishmael as the representative of the Davidic dynasty, and the heir of that dynasty's claims to the loyalty of the Jews.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.42":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah.

Jeremiah, we have been already told, was one of the refugees at Mizpah (Jeremiah 40:6), and consequently was forced into the train of Ishmael (Jeremiah 41:16). Pray for us. This petition has been accused of hypocrisy, but the prophecy of Jeremiah assumes throughout that it was made in earnest (ver. 20 proven nothing to the contrary).

Why this delay? Keil thinks it was for the sake of the people, who needed time to collect themselves and listen calmly to the revelation. Ezekiel once waited seven days (Ezekiel 3:16); but this was owing to his own disturbed state of mind. The answer of the Lord extends to ver. 18, the last four verses being an epilogue enforcing the Divine declaration. It consists of the promise (vers. 9-12) that, if the people will remain quietly in the land, they will be protected; and of the threat (vers. 13-18) that, if they presume to migrate into Egypt, they will perish there by sword, famine, and pestilence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Build you, and not pull you down, etc. Some of Jeremiah's favourite phrases (see on Jeremiah 24:6). I repent me. And yet in 1 Samuel 15:29 we read that \"Israel's Trust... is not a man that he should repent.\" The key to the discrepancy may be found in Psalm 18:25, 26, \"With the pious thou showest thyself pious... and with the froward thou showest thyself froward.\" There is no change in the nature or purpose of God, but only in his conduct towards man. The term \"repent\" is, therefore, only used analogically.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will show mercies unto you; rather, I will procure you mercy.

The calamities mentioned were precisely these of which the Jews were apprehensive in their own country. So afterwards, \"whereof ye are afraid.\" Shall overtake you there. For a further explanation, see Jeremiah 43:8-13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For ye dissembled in your hearts; rather, for ye have gone astray (from the right path) at the risk of your lives; or, another possible rendering, for ye hate led yourselves astray. Hypocrisy is certainly not the accusation which Jeremiah brings against the people.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah42:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.43":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - All the proud men. It would seem as if the \"proud men\" were distinguished from others. Jeremiah had called the whole people together (Jeremiah 42:8); but a few domineering men assumed to represent the rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on. A singular supposition - Jeremiah leaving the initiative to his secretary! It may be conjectured that Baruch had somehow made himself specially unpopular; he may have been a more practical man (comp. Jeremiah 45:5) than Jeremiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - All the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations. The specification is peculiar, as it seems to leave out of sight the most important part of the gathering at Mizpah, via. the \"men, and women, and children, and those of the poor of the land\" (Jeremiah 40:7) - the very persons who are mentioned just afterwards. Possibly there is some confusion in the text. \"All nations\" doubtless means especially Moab, Ammon, and Edom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Tahpanhea. An Egyptian frontier city (see Ezekiel 30:18 and note on Jeremiah 2:16), where the fugitives had to wait till the views of the Egyptian government respecting them were made known. The supposed site of the Pelusiac Daphnae has not yet been explored; a single inscribed fragment would reveal the Egyptian name, and probably ratify the identity of Daphnae with the Tahpanhes of the prophets (R.S. Poole, 'The Cities of Egypt,' p. 177).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Take great stones, etc. A strange symbolic act of Jeremiah's is here described. \"We must not suppose, arguing from our Western and precise notions, that he would be at all necessarily interfered with. In fact, he would have a twofold security, as a prophet of God to those who acknowledged him as such, and in the opinion of others as insane, and, according to Eastern ideas, thus especially under Divine promptings in his acts\" (Streane). He is directed to take great stones and embed them in the mortar (not \"clay\") in the brick pavement at the entry of the palace. When the events predicted came to pass, these stones would testify that Jeremiah had predicted them. The word rendered \"brick pavement\" is of doubtful meaning. In Nahum 3:14 it signifies \"brick kiln.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And will set his throne, etc.; viz. for the victorious king to hold judgment (comp. Jeremiah 1:15, 16; Jeremiah 49:38). He shall spread his royal pavilion; rather, his tapestry (the root means \"brilliance\"); i.e. the bright coloured covering of the throne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He shall smite the land of Egypt. On the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, wrongly controverted by some, see note on Jeremiah 46:13. Such as are for death. Such as are destined for death (i.e. pestilence, as Jeremiah 15:2; Jeremiah 18:21). The words, \"and deliver,\" prefixed in the Authorized Version, are unnecessary; \"land\" is equivalent to \"population.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Burn them; viz. the temples. Egypt was full of gorgeous and imposing temples, which could not, however, always be burned, nor were the conquerors of Egypt anxious to display hostility to Egyptian religion. Carry them away captives; viz. the idol gods (comp. Jeremiah 48:7, \"Chemosh shall no forth into captivity:\" and Isaiah 46:2, \"Their soul [or, 'personality'] hath gone into captivity\"). The prophet speaks from the point of view of a believer in the idol gods. He shall array himself with the land of Egypt, etc. (For \"array himself with\" and \"putteth on,\"read wrap himself in and wrappeth himself in.) Ewald well explains this figure. \"As easily as the shepherd in the open field wraps himself in the cool night in his mantle, will he be able to grasp Egypt with his hand and fling it round him like an easily managed garment, in order then to leave the land as an absolute conqueror, clothed in this attire of booty, in peace, without an enemy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah43:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The images of Beth-shemesh; rather, the pillars of Beth-shemesh; i.e. the obelisks of the temple of Ra, the sun god, from Which Heliopolis derived its sacred name \"Pe-Ra\" \"the abode of Ra.\" It was the custom to place obelisks in pairs at the entrance of their temples. Only one of those of Heliopolis is still standing, though that, indeed, is the oldest in Egypt, for it was \"set up at least four thousand years ago\" (R. S. Poole, 'The Cities of Egypt,' p. 131). That is in the land of Egypt. To distinguish it from the Beth-shemesh in Palestine. But we may also render \"which are,\" etc.; comp. \"the gods of Egypt\" in the second verse half. The Septuagint reads, \"which are in On.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.44":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-14. - Accusation brought against the obstinately idolatrous people. Verse 1. - Which dwell; rather, which dwelt. It appears from this verse that the Jewish fugitives had separated in Egypt, some going to the two northern frontier cities, Migdol (on which see R.S. Poole, 'The Cities of Egypt,' ch. 8.) and Tahpanhes or Daphnae, others further south to Noph, i.e. Memphis, or, less probably, Napata (see on Jeremiah 2:16), and Pathros (i.e. Upper Egypt; comp.

The prophet wonderingly asks if they have forgotten the sins of their forefathers and the consequent calamities. No other explanation of this present idolatry seems possible; and yet how passing strange is it! Their wives. The Hebrew has \"his wives,\" i.e. according to Kimchi and Hitzig, the wives of each of the kings (sometimes great patrons of idolatry). But it is better to adopt, with Ewald, Graf, and Dr. Payne Smith, the reading of the Septuagint, \"his princes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They are not humbled; rather, not made contrite (literally, not crushed, viz. by repentance).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To cut off all Judah; i.e. the Judah in Egypt, not that in Babylon.

A particular vow to the divinity is meant. The queen of heaven (see on Jeremiah 7:18). Then had we plenty of victuals, etc. An extremely important passage, as revealing the view taken of their misfortunes by Jews of the average type. Jeremiah regarded the misfortunes of his country as proofs of the displeasure of Jehovah; these Jews, on the other hand, of his impotence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - This part of the reply belongs to the women, who declare that, their husbands' consent having been given to their vow, Jeremiah has no right to interfere (see Numbers 30:6, 7). Burned...poured, etc.; rather, burn, pour. Did we, etc.; rather, do we, etc. To worship her. The sense of the Hebrew is doubtful; but the best reading seems that of Rashi, Graf, and Dr. Payne Smith, \"to make her image.\" Without our men; rather, without our husbands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-30. - Jeremiah's rejoinder.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Remember them; i.e. the repeated acts of idolatry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - With your hand; rather, with your hands. Ye will surely accomplish, etc.; rather, ye shall, etc., by all means perform your vows, and take the consequence.

In the midst of judgment, God remembers mercy, and his ancient covenant. A remnant is saved as the nucleus of a regenerate people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - A sign; rather, the sign.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah44:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - I will give Pharaoh-hophra, etc. The sign consists in the capture of Hophra by his deadly enemies. Henceforth he will live in constant alarm, for he is in the hands of those \"that seek his life.\" All that we know of the fate of Hophra (Apries) is derived from Herodotus (2:169), who states that Amssis \"gave Apries over into the hands of his former subjects, to deal with as they chose. Then the Egyptians took him and strangled him\" (see further on Jeremiah 46:13).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.45":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah45:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - These words; i.e. the revelations which Baruch had committed (or was committing) to writing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah45:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah45:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Hath added grief to my sorrow. Baruch felt \"sorrow\" or \"pain\" at the sinfulness of the people; \"grief\" or \"anxiety\" was added by Jeremiah's announcement of the judgment. I fainted in my sighing; rather, I am weary with my sighing; comp. Psalm 6:7 (Authorized Version, 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah45:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - That which I have built (comp, Jeremiah 1:10 and parallel passages).

All around is passing through a sore crisis, and canst thou expect a better lot? It is no time for personal ambition, when the very foundations of the state are crumbling.

Pharaoh-necho. Necho II., a member of the twenty-sixth Egyptian dynasty, sou of Psametik I. (Psammetichus), who had for a time revived the declining power of Egypt. Herodotus (2:158) credits him with being the first to construct a canal to the Red Sea, which seems an exaggeration (see Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note ap. Rawlinson), also (4:42) with having caused the circumnavigation of Africa, after which the Phoenician seamen brought back the startling news that they had had the sun upon their right hand. This energetic monarch noticed the decline of Assyria, and, at the battle of Megiddo (Herodotus, 2:159, wrongly says Magdolus or Migdol), reattached Judah to the Egyptian empire. Four years later, at the battle of Carchemish, he himself sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (2 Chronicles 35:20). Carehemish. This was the great emporium of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. Its true site was discovered by Mr. George Smith, in his last fatal journey, to be at Jerabis or Jirbas, on the right bank of the Euphrates. It was anciently a city of the Kheta (equivalent to Khittim, \"Hittites\"), but passed to the Assyrians, under Sargon, under whom it attained the highest commercial prosperity, especially after the overthrow of Tyre by Sennacherib. The \"mana,\" or mina, \"of Gargamis\" is constantly referred to as a standard weight in the commercial cuneiform inscriptions. In the fourth year, etc. Marcus Niebuhr wishes to put a stop before these words, so as to make them a definition of the date of the prophecy. He thinks the date of the battle of Carchemish was the third and not the fourth year of Jehoiakim. This view, however, is very uncertain (see Keil), and it is exegetieally very unnatural to detach the closing words of ver. 2 from those which precede. The obvious inference, moreover, from the prophecy (vers. 2-12) is that it was written at or about the time of the battle; a special date for the prophecy did not require to be given. Should Niebuhr's chronological combinations, however, turn out to be correct, the mistake would probably not be that of Jeremiah, nor of his scribe, but of his editor, who may easily have fallen into error in the mere minutiae of chronology.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOrder ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Order ye, etc. The leaders of the Egyptians are heard summoning their men to make ready their armour, and set themselves in array (comp. ver. 9).

An equally possible rendering, and one which better suits the parallelism, is, \"mount the chargers.\" Put on the brigandines. \"Brigandine\" is an archaic word (Hakluyt's 'Voyages'), meaning the armour of a \"brigand \"or member of a \"brigade,\" or \"troop\" (comp.

Hence the astonished question, Wherefore have I seen, etc.? literally, Why do I see (that) they (are) dismayed, turning back? And look not back. With the object of rallying the scattered forces. For fear was round about. It is a pity that the Authorized Version has not kept one uniform rendering for this favourite expression of Jeremiah. In Jeremiah 6:25 (see note) it is translated, \"fear is on every side\" (Hebrew, magor missabib).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let not the swift flee away. A strong way of expressing that even the swiftest cannot expect to flee, just as, in Isaiah 2:9, \"forgive them not\" means \"thou canst not forgive them.\" Nothing seems to have struck the Jews so much as the unparalleled swiftness of the Chaldean warriors (Hebrews 1:6, 8; Jeremiah 4:13). They shall stumble; literally, they have stumbled; it is most probably the prophetic perfect (\"they shall certainly fall\"), though Ewald denies this, and consequently maintains that the prophecy was written after the battle of Car-chemish. Toward the north; i.e. \"in the northern region,\" or, more loosely, \"in the north\" (comp. ver. 10). Carchemish was, of course, far to the north of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Who is this, etc.? \"Once more surprise at the [same] phenomenon recurs, and in a stronger form; a monstrous, devastating river appears to roll itself wildly along, overwhelming all countries: who is it? It is Egypt, which is now threatening to overrun the earth and to lay everything waste, whose various nationalities are advancing fully equipped\" (Ewald). As a flood; rather, as the Nile (y'or, a word of Egyptian affinities, and only once used of another river than the Nile, Daniel 12:5, 6, 7). The naturalness of the figure in this context needs no exhibiting. It reminds us of Isaiah 8:7, 8, where the Assyrian army is compared to the Euphrates. Are moved as the rivers; rather, toss themselves as the rivers. By the \"rivers\" the prophet means the branches of the Nile, which are described by the same word in Isaiah 19:8; Exodus 7:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEgypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Egypt riseth up, etc. The answer to the question in ver. 7. The city. The article is not expressed; and there can be no doubt that the word is used collectively of cities in general (comp. Jeremiah 47:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A call to the army, particularizing its two grand divisions, viz. the warriors in chariots, and the light and heavy armed infantry. M. Piorret, of the Egyptian Museum at the Louvre, writes thus: \"The army was composedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of infantry equipped with a cuirass, a buckler, a pike or an axe, and a sword; they manoeuvred to the sound of the drum and the trumpet;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) of light troops (archers, slingers, and other soldiers carrying the axe or the tomahawk);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) warriors in chariots. Cavalry, properly so called, was not employed ... The Egyptians also enlisted auxiliaries, such as Mashawash, a tribe of Libyans, who, after the defeat of a confederation of northern peoples hostile to Menephtah, into which they had entered, refused to leave Egypt, and entered the Egyptian army; the Kahakas, another Libyan tribe; the Shardanas (Sardinians); the Madjaiu, who, after having been in war with the Egyptians under the twelfth dynasty, enrolled themselves under the standard of their conquerors, and constituted a sort of gendarmerie,\" etc. ('Dictionnaire d'Archdologie Egyptienne,' pp. 64, 65). Among the mercenaries mentioned by Jeremiah, the Ludim deserve special mention. They are generally supposed to be a North African people (and so Ezekiel 30:5). Professor Sayce, however, thinks they may be the Lydian soldiers by whose help Psammetichus made Egypt independent of Assyria, and his successors maintained their power (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:287). Come up, ye horses; rather, bound (or, prance), ye horses. The verb is literally go up, and seems to be used in the same sense, only in the Hiphil or causative conjugation, in Nahum 3:3 (which should begin, \"Horsemen making (their horses) to rear\"). Ewald and others render, \"Mount the horses,\" the phrase being substantially the same as in ver. 4 (see above). But the parallelism here is opposed to this; and the prophet has evidently been a reader of the prophecy of Nahum, as the very next clause shows. Rage, ye chariots; rather, rush madly, ye chariots (alluding to Nahum 2:5). The Ethioplans; Hebrew, Cush; often mentioned in connection with Egypt. The whole Nile valley, as far as Abyssinia, had been reduced to an Egyptian province. At last Cush had its turn of revenge, and an Ethiopian dynasty reigned in the palaces of Thebes (s.c. 725-665). The Libyans; Hebrew, Put (which occurs in combination with Lud, as here with Ludim, in Ezekiel 27:10; Ezekiel 30:5). This appears to be the Egyptian Put (nasalized into Punt), i.e. the Somali country on the east coast of Africa, opposite to Arabia (Brugsch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The contrast. And yet that day is (the day) of the Lord, Jehovah Sabdoth (the rendering of the Authorized Version, For this is the day, etc., is clearly a mistake). The \"day of Jehovah\" is an expression so familiar to us that we are in danger of losing a part of its sublime meaning. It is, in brief, \"that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient .... This great crisis is called a day, in antithesis to the ages of the Divine long suffering: it is Jehovah's day, because, without a special Divine interposition, there would be no issue out of the perplexities and miseries of human life.\" We may say, with equal truth, that there are many \"days of the Lord,\" and that there is only one. Every great revolution is a fresh stage in the great judgment day; \"die Weltgesehichte ist das Weltgericht\" (Schiller). The loci classici for the expression in the prophets are Amos 5:18, 20; Zephaniah 1:7, 14; Joel 2:1, 11; Isaiah 2:12; Isaiah 13:6, 9 (in Isaiah 2:12, the phraseology closely resembles that of our passage - \"for there is a day unto Jehovah Sabaoth;\" Jehovah, that is, hath it in readiness in the supersensible world, where there is no time, and where all God's purposes have an ideal, but no less real existence. We might, in fact, render our passage, \"but that day (is the day that belongeth) unto the Lord,\" etc.). The Lord here, as generally elsewhere, is that expressive form which intimates the universal lordship of the God who has revealed himself to Israel. The sword. A comparison with Isaiah 34:6 suggests that it is \"the sword of the Lord\" which is meant - a symbolic phrase for the Divine vengeance, which meets us again in Jeremiah 12:12; Jeremiah 47:6; Deuteronomy 32:41, 42; Judges 7:20 (comp. Joshua 5:13); Isaiah 27:1; Isaiah 31:8; Isaiah 34:5, 6; Isaiah 66:16; Zechariah 13:7. If Jehovah can be spoken of as having an Arm, a Hand, and a Bow, why not also as having a sword? Both expressions represent the self-revealing side of the Divine nature, and are not merely poetical ornaments, but correspond to awful objective realities. Divine vengeance exists, and must exercise itself on all who oppose the Divine will. Hath a sacrifice. The same figurative expression occurs in Isaiah 34:6, and, developed at considerable length, in Ezekiel 39:17-20, where the slaughtered foes are described as fatted beasts, rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks - animals employed in the Jewish sacrifices. This, then, is the purpose for which this immense host \"rolls up from Africa\" - it is that it may fall by the Euphrates, at once as a proof of God's justice, and as a warning to transgressors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Go up into Gilead (see on Jeremiah 8:22). In vain shalt thou use, etc.; rather, in vain hast thou used, etc.; a much more vigorous, pictorial expression. Thou shalt not be cured. The literal rendering is more forcible, there is no plaster for thee; i.e. no bandage will avail to heal the wound (comp. Jeremiah 30:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Hath filled the land; rather, the earth, corresponding to \"the nations.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The word, etc. This verse is the heading of a new prophecy, which, however, for the reason already mentioned (see introduction to this chapter), is not to be regarded as entirely independent of the preceding prophecy, but rather as a supplement (just as Isaiah 18, though not in strict sequence to Isaiah 17:12-14, is yet a supplement to it). The heading does not expressly state when the prophecy was written, but from the mention of Nebuchadnezzar, both in the heading and in the prophecy itself, we may assume a date subsequent to the battle of Carchemish, for the earlier prophecies contain no reference to that redoubtable name. An important question now arises - When did Nebuchadnezzar invade and conquer Egypt? and what would be the consequences of admitting that a Babylonian subjugation of that country is historically not proven? There can be no doubt that Jeremiah did hold out such a prospect; for he not only says so here, but also in Jeremiah 43:8-13 and Jeremiah 44:30. In the latter prophecy it is not Necho, but Hophra, in whose reign the blow is to fall. But no monumental evidence has as yet been found [see, however, postscript to this note] of anything approaching to an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar; nor do the accounts of Herodotus (2:159, etc.) at all supply the deficiency (on this, however, see further at end of note). It is true that Josephus quotes passages from Berosus, the Babylonian historian, to the effect that Nabopolassar had set a Chaldean governor over Egypt, but that this governor had revolted, and that Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadnezzar, crushed the rebellion and incorporated Egypt into his empire. But these events happened, according to the quotation from Berosus, partly before, partly immediately after, the death of Nabopolassar, and was consequently earlier than the prophecy in this chapter. Another fact of importance must be mentioned in this connection, viz. that Ezekiel repeats the announcement of the Babylonian conquest of Egypt, of which he speaks as if it were to happen at the close of the thirteen years of Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre (Ezekiel 29:17-21). Thus there is a gradual increase in the definiteness of the announcement. Looking at our chapter by itself, we might suppose that the conquest was to take place soon after the decisive battle at Carchemish. After the murder of Gedaliah, when Jeremiah had removed to Egypt, we find him foretelling the sore punishment of Egypt in greater detail, and the name of Hophra (instead of Necho) is introduced as that of the deposed king. Finally, Ezekiel (as we have seen) specifies a definite time. Now, it is true that our knowledge of this period is somewhat incomplete. We have not the direct historical proof that could be wished as to the result of Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre, though it would be fastidious to scruple at the evidence which satisfied so cool a judgment as that of George Grote. The great historian denies, however, that Tyre at this time suffered such a terrific desolation as is suggested by a literal interpretation of Ezekiel 26, and continues in these remarkable terms: \"Still less can it be believed that that king conquered Egypt and Libya, as Megasthenes, and even Berosus so far as Egypt is concerned, would have us believe - the argument of Latchet, 'Ad Herodot.,' 2:168, is anything but satisfactory. The defeat of the Egyptian king at Carchemish, and the stripping him of his foreign possessions in Judaea and Syria, have been exaggerated into a conquest of Egypt itself\" ('Hist. of Greece,' vol. 3. p. 445, note 1). Supposing Mr. Grote's view of the facts of the siege of Tyre to be correct, it is clear that the prophet's reproduction of the Divine revelation made to him was defective; that it presents traces of a stronger human element than we are accustomed to admit. Tyre had to suffer a fall; but the fall was not as yet to be so complete a one as Ezekiel, reasoning upon his revelation, supposed. It is equally possible that Jeremiah and Ezekiel, reasoning upon the revelation of the inevitable fall of Egypt, mistook the time when, in its fulness, the Divine judg. ment was to take place. The case may, perhaps, turn out to be analogous to that of an apparently but not really unfulfilled prophecy in Isaiah 43:3. A literal interpretation of that passage would give the conquest of Egypt to Cyrus; as a matter of fact, we know that it was Cambyses, and not Cyrus, who fulfilled the prophecy. It would not be surprising if we should have to admit that it was Cambyses, and not any earlier monarch, who fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah. Certain great principles of God's moral government had to be affirmed; it was of no moment whatever whether Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, or Cambyses was the instrument of their affirmation. A parallel from Isaiah may again be adduced. The shameful captivity of Egypt, and perhaps Ethiopia, which Isaiah foresaw in the time of Sargon (Isaiah 20:3), was not realized in fact until Esar-haddon despoiled Tithakah, King of Egypt and Ethiopia, of the whole of Upper Egypt. There are cases in which a literal fulfilment of prophecy may be abandoned without detriment to Divine revelation, and this seems to be one of them. And yet we must always remember that even the letter of the prophecy may some day turn out to be more nearly in harmony with facts than we have supposed, our knowledge of this period being in several respects so very imperfect. It has been acutely pointed out that the oracle given to Necho (Herod., 2:158), \"that he was labouring for the barbarian,\" seems to imply a current expectation of an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, and that the gradual conquest by that king of one neighbouring country after another suggests that the invasion of Egypt was at any rate the object at which he aimed. The silence of Herodotus as to a Chaldean invasion is, perhaps, not very important. He does not mention Necho's defeat by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish, nor does he ever refer to the victories over Egypt of any King of Assyria. POSTSCRIPT. - The above note is left precisely as it was written, February, 1881, in ignorance of Wiedemann's then recent discovery of a contemporary hieroglyphic inscription which, as the report of the German Oriental Society expresses it, \"ratifies the hitherto universally doubted fact of an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar.\" The hieroglyphic narrative is supplemented and confirmed by two cuneiform records, and the combined results are as follows. In the thirty-seventh year of his reign, Hophra or Apries being King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar undertook an expedition against Egypt, and penetrated as far as the island of Elephantine, and damaged the temple of Chnum, which stood there. His army could not, however, pass the cataracts. At Syene the Egyptian troops, under Neshor, met and repelled the invaders. Two years later, however, the Babylonians came again, were victorious over the Egyptian host under Amasis, and compelled the whole land to pay tribute. Thus we have a remarkable confirmation of Ezekiel's prophecy that Egypt should be \"waste and desolate from Migdol unto Syene, even unto the border of Ethiopia\" (Ezekiel 29:10). It should be mentioned that the Babylonians are not described in the hieroglyphics by their proper name, but as \"the Syrians (?), the peoples of the north, the Asiatics;\" it is from a terra-cotta cuneiform tablet that we learn that, in Nebuchadnezzar's thirty-seventh year (B.C. 568-7), a war arose between him and the King of Egypt, which ended with the payment of tribute to the former (Wiedemann, in 'AEgyptische Zeitschrift,' 1878, pp. 2-6 and 87-89; ' Geschichte AEgyptens,' 1880, pp. 168-170). The value of prophecy does not, happily, depend on the minuteness of its correspondence with history, and the evidential value of the argument from such a correspondence is but secondary. Still, as long as such a correspondence can be proved, even in part, by facts such as Wiedemann has discovered, the apologist is perfectly justified in using it in confirmation of the authority of Scripture. The second prophecy falls into two parts - vers. 14-19 and 20-26 respectively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeclare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-19. - The cities of Egypt are called upon to prepare to meet the foe. But it is in vain; for all that is great and mighty in the land - Apis, the mercenary soldiers, and the Pharaoh - bows down before that terrible one who is comparable only to the most imposing objects in the inanimate world. Pharaoh's time is over; and Egypt must go into captivity. Verse 14. - Declare ye; viz. the approach of the foe (comp. Jeremiah 4:5). The news is to be told in the frontier towns Migdol and Tahpanhes, and in the northern capital Noph or Memphis (see on Jeremiah 2:16; 44:1). The sword shall devour, etc.; rather, the sword hath devoured those round about thee. The neighbouring nations (the same phrase occurs in Jeremiah 48:17, 39) have one after another succumbed; no ally is left there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Why are thy valiant men, etc.? The literal rendering of the received text is, Why is thy strong ones (plural) swept sway (or, cast down)? He stood not, because Jehovah thrust him! It is true that the first half of the verse might, consistently with grammar, be rendered, \"Why are thy strong ones swept away?\" But the following singulars prove that the subject of the verb in the first verse half must itself be a singular. We must, therefore, follow the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and many of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, and change the plural \"strong ones\" into the singular \"strong one.\" The word so rendered is elsewhere in Jeremiah one used (in the plural) of strong horses (Jeremiah 8:16; Jeremiah 47:3; Jeremiah 1:11); but there is no necessity to bind ourselves to this acceptation. Other possible meanings areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) strong man, e.g. Judges 5:22 and Lamentations 1:15;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) steer, bull, e.g. Psalm 22:13 and Psalm 50:13, and (metaphorically of princes) Psalm 68:31. It is a tenable view that \"thy strong one\" is to be understood distributively as equivalent to \"every strong one of thine.\" But it is certainly more plausible to regard the phrase as a synonym for Apis, the sacred bull in which the supreme god Osiris was believed by the Egyptians to be incarnate. This was a superstition (strange, no doubt, but not so ignoble as some have thought) as deeply ingrained in the Egyptian mind as any in their complicated religion. \"In fact, they believed that the supreme God was with them when they possessed a bull bearing certain hieratic marks, the signs of the incarnation of the divinity\" (Pierrot). His death was the signal for a mourning as general as for a Pharaoh, and the funeral ceremonies (accounts of which are given in the inscriptions) were equally splendid. M. Mariette has discovered, in the neighbourhood of Memphis, a necropolis in which the Apis bulls were successively interred from the eighteenth dynasty to the close of the period of the Ptolemies. For the Apis to be \"swept away\" like ordinary plunder, or \"cast down\" in the slaughtering trough (comp. Isaiah 34:7), was indeed a token that the glory of Egypt had departed. It is a singular coincidence that the very word here employed by Jeremiah for \"bull\" (abbir) was adopted (like many other words) into the Egyptian language - it received the slightly modified form aber. The Septuagint, it should be added, is in favour of the general view of the verse thus obtained, and the authority of the Egyptian-Jewish version in a prophecy relative to Egypt is not slight. Its rendering of the first half is, \"Why hath Apis, thy chosen calf, fled?\" But the probability is that it read the Hebrew differently, \"Why hath Khaph ( = Apis), thy chosen one, fled?\" This merely involves grouping some letters otherwise, and reading one word a little differently.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To fall; rather, to stumble. The fugitives are in such a wild confusion that they stumble over each other. The parallel passage in the earlier prophecy (ver. 12) suggests that the Egyptian warriors are here referred to, the most trustworthy portion of which, since the time of Psammetichus, was composed of mercenaries, the native troops having lost that military ardour for which they had been anciently renowned (see Herod., 2:152, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note ap. Rawlinson). Being devoid of patriotic feeling, it was natural that these hired soldiers should hasten from the doomed country, exclaiming, as the prophet puts it, Arise, and let us go again to our own people. Greeks were probably among the speakers, at any rate, Ionians and Carians formed the mercenary troops of Psammetiehus, according to Herodotus (2:152).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They did cry there, etc.; rather, they cry there, viz. the following words. But why should attention be called to the place where the cry is made? and why should the mercenaries (the subject of the preceding verb, and therefore presumably of this verb) have their exclamation recorded? Alter the vowel points (which merely represent an early but not infallible exegetical tradition), and all becomes clear. We then get a renewal of the summons in ver. 14 to make a proclamation respecting the war. The persons addressed are, not foreigners, but the children of the soil, and the summons runs thus: \"Call ye the name of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, Desolation.\" No longer \"Pharaoh,\" honoured by titles indicating that he, like Apis, is a Divine incarnation (neb, i.e. lord, and nuter, i.e. god), but Shaon, the Hebrew for Desolation, is the fittest name for the fallen monarch. The custom of changing names with a symbolic meaning is no strange one to readers of the prophecies. We have met with it in this very book (see Jeremiah 20:3); and Isaiah contains a parallel as exact as could be desired, in the famous passage in which the prophetic name (itself symbolic) of Egypt (Rahab, i.e. boisterousness, arrogance) is changed into \"Rahabhem-shebheth\" (i.e. \"Rahab! they are utter indolence\"). In behalf of this view we may claim the authority of a tradition still older than that preserved in the vowel points, for the Septuagint (followed substantially by the Peshito and the Vulgate) has, Καλέσατε τὸ ὄνομα Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου Σαών. He hath passed the time appointed. A difficult clause, and variously interpreted. One thing is clear, that \"passed\" cannot be correct, as the verb is in the Hifil or causative conjugation. We must, at any rate, render, \"He hath let the time appointed pass by.\" This is, in fact, the simplest and most natural explanation. There was a time within which repentance might have averted the judgment of God; but this \"accepted time\" has been foolishly let slip.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The threat implied in ver. 17 is set forth more fully; he who speaks is a very different \"king\" from the fallen Pharaoh. As Tabor is among the mountains. The sense is deformed by the insertion of \"is.\" The King of Babylon is compared to \"Tabor among the mountains and Carmel by the sea.\" Mount Tabor is a most prominent object, owing to the wide extent of the plain of Esdraelon, in which it is situated; and a similar remark applies to Mount Carmel. The view of Tabor differs considerably according to the point from which it is taken; but \"its true figure is an elongated oval\" (Thomson). Carmel, so called from the rich orchards and vineyards with which it was anciently adorned, is not lofty (being only about six hundred feet above the sea), but the form in which it breaks off towards the sea has a beauty of its own. It is now deprived of its rich forest and garden culture, but is still described as \"a glorious mountain.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt; literally, O inhabitress-daughter of Egypt. The phrase is exactly parallel to \"virgin daughter of Zion.\" The \"daughter of Egypt\" means the population of Egypt, the land being regarded as the mother of its people. Furnish thyself to go into captivity. The rendering of the margin is, however, more exact. The \"vessels of captivity [or, 'exile']\" are a pilgrim's staff and wallet, with the provisions and utensils necessary for a journey (so in Ezekiel 12:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEgypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-26. - A figurative description of the dark future of Egypt. Verse 20. - Like a very fair heifer. (The insertion of \"like\" weakens the passage.) The well nourished heifer reminds of the prosperity of the fruitful Nile valley. But destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north; rather, a gadfly from the north hath come upon her (not, \"hath come, hath come,\" as the received text has - a very slight change in one letter is required, supported by the versions). The figure is precisely analogous to that of the \"bee in the land of Assyria\" (Isaiah 7:18). St. Chrysostom renders \"a gadfly\" (see Field, 'Origen's Hexapla,' 2:708); and so virtually Aquila and Symmachus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Also her hired men are in the midst of her, etc.; rather, also her hirelings in the midst of her are like, etc. These seem to be distinguished from the mercenaries mentioned in ver. 9, the Ethiopians, Libyans, and Arabs, who were never adopted into the midst of the Egyptian people. On the other hand, the description will exactly apply to the Caftans and Ionians in the service of Psammetichus and Apries (Herod., 2:152, 163), who were \"for many years\" settled \"a little below the city of Bubastis, on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile.\" In this fertile country, itself comparable to \"a very fair heifer\" (ver. 20), these pampered and privileged mercenaries became \"like calves of the stall.\" They did not stand, etc.; rather, they have not stood (firm), for the day of their destruction is come upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; rather, her voice is like (the sound of) a serpent gliding away. Egypt (like Jerusalem, in Isaiah 29:4) is imagined as a maiden (comp. ver. 19) seated on the ground, and faintly sighing; and her feeble voice is likened to the rustling sound of a serpent in motion. Come against her with axes. A sudden change of figure. Egypt, or, more strictly, Egypt's grandeur - its rich and complex national life, its splendid cities, its powerful army, all combined in one, is now compared to a forest (comp. Jeremiah 21:14; Jeremiah 22:6, 7; Isaiah 2:13; Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34). It seems far fetched to suppose, with Graf and Dr. Payne Smith, that the comparison of the Chaldean warriors to wood cutters arose from their being armed with axes. It is probably true that the Israelites did not use the battle axe, but the axe is merely an accident of the description. It is the forest which suggests the mention of the axe, not the axe that of the forest, and forests were familiar enough to the Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - They shall cut down; better, they cut down. The prophet is describing a picture which passes before his inner eye. Though it cannot be searched; rather, for it cannot be searched out. The subject of the verb is uncertain. De Dieu's explanation is, \"Because the forest is so dense, so intricate, it is necessary to clear a path by cutting down the trees.\" But this does not seem to suit the context. Surely no other reason was required for the destruction of the \"forest\" than the will of the wood cutters. \"Searching out\" occurs in Job (Job 5:9; Job 9:10; Job 36:26; comp. also 1 Kings 7:47) in connection with numbering, and the second half of the verse expressly describes the foe as innumerable. The singular alternates with the plural, as in Isaiah 5:28, a host being regarded sometimes as a whole, and sometimes as an aggregate of individuals. Than the grasshoppers; rather, the locust. The name is one of nine which we find given to the various species of locusts in the Old Testament, and means \"multitudinous.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Shall be confounded; rather, is brought to shame; the next verb too should rather be in the past tense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The multitude of No; rather, Amen of No. Amon-Ra, or rather Amen-Ra, was the name adopted at Thebes (Homer's Thebes \"of the hundred gateways,\" 'Iliad,' 9:383, called here \"No,\" and in Nahum 3:8 \"No [of] Anion\") from the time of the eleventh dynasty, for the sun god Ra. Amen (Amen) signifies \"hidden,\" for it is the mysterious, invisible deity who manifests himself in bodily form in the sun. From this name comes the classic designation, Jupiter-Ammon. Their gods... their kings; rather, her gods... her kings (viz. Egypt's). The \"kings\" are probably the high officials of the state, not a few of whom were either by birth or marriage members of the royal family. Even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him.

To understand this, we must assume that during its period of depression Egypt has been but sparsely peopled, owing to the large numbers of its inhabitants carried away captive. Another explanation, \"afterwards Egypt shall stay at home [i.e, 'be quiet'],\" though equally justifiable item the point of view of the lexicon (comp. Judges 5:17; Psalm 55:7), seems less natural. Possibly Ezekiel 29:13-16 is a development of our passage; it contains a promise of future remission of punishment, though a promise qualified in such a way as to be akin to a threat. The words, \"And it shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel\" (Ezekiel 29:16), seem like a comment on Jeremiah's threat to \"Pharaoh, and them that trust in him,\" in the preceding verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - A word of comfort to Israel, obviously not written at the same time as the preceding prophecy. The prophet is suddenly transported in imagination into the period of the Babylonian exile. Egypt and its fortunes are far away; the troubles of Israel entirely absorb his attention. After thinking sadly of the reverses of his people, he bursts out with an encouraging exhortation not to fear, though, humanly speaking, there was everything to fear. Did Jeremiah write these verses here? There is strong reason to doubt it; for they occur, with insignificant variations, in Jeremiah 30:10, 11, where they cohere far better with the context than here.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah46:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.47":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah47:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Against the Philistines; rather, concerning (as usual in similar cases).

Verse 2. - Waters rise up. The prophets think in figures, and no figure is so familiar to them (alas for the unstable condition of those times!) as that of an overflowing torrent for an invading army (see on Jeremiah 46:8, and add to the parallel passages Isaiah 28:18; Ezekiel 26:19; Daniel 11:10). Out of the north. To suppose that this refers to Pharaoh-necho returning from Carchemish seems forced and unnatural. If Necho conquered Gaza at the period supposed, it would be on his way to Carchemish, and not on his return. Besides,\" the north\" is the standing symbol for the home of the dreaded Assyrian and Babylonian foes (see on Jeremiah 1:14). Isaiah had uttered a very similar prediction when the Assyrian hosts were sweeping through Palestine (Isaiah 14:31). An overflowing flood; rather, torrent. The same phrase occurs in Isaiah 30:28, where the \"breath\" of the angry God is described with this figurative expression. It is in autumn time that the torrents of Palestine become dangerous, and water courses, dry or almost dry in summer (comp. Jeremiah 15:18), become filled with a furiously rushing stream.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah47:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A fine specimen of Hebrew word painting. The rushing of his chariots. \"Rushing\" has the sense of the German rauschen, to make a rustling, murmuring sound. It is used (but as the equivalent of a different Hebrew word) in the Authorized Version of Isaiah 18:12, 13 of the confused sound made by an army in motion. In the present passage, the Hebrew word means something more definite than that in Isaiah, l.c.; it is the \"crashing\" of an earthquake, or (as here) the \"rattling\" of chariots. The rumbling of his wheels. \"Rumbling\" is a happy equivalent. The Hebrew (hamon) is the word referred to in the preceding note as meaning an indefinite confused sound. The fathers shall not look back to their children, etc. An awful picture, and still more effective in the concise language of the original. The Hebrew Scriptures excel (as still more strikingly, but with too great a want of moderation, does the Koran) in the sublime of terror. So overpowering shall the panic be that fathers will not even turn an eye to their helpless children. Observe, it is said \"the fathers,\" not \"the mothers.\" The picture is poetically finer than that in Deuteronomy 28:56, 57, because the shade of colouring is a degree softer. Feebleness of hands. A common expression for the enervation produced by extreme terror (see Jeremiah 6:24; Isaiah 13:7; Ezekiel 7:17; Nahum 2:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah47:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The day that cometh; rather, the day that hath come (i.e. shall have come). It is \"the day of the Lord\" that is meant, that revolutionary \"shaking of all things\" (to use Haggai's expression, Haggai 2:21), as to which see further in note on Jeremiah 46:10. To cut off... every helper that remaineth; i.e. every ally on whom they could still reckon. This passage favours the view that the judgment upon the Philistines took place at the same time as that upon Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar's object was to isolate Tyre and Sidon as completely as possible. The remnant. The Philistines had suffered so much from repeated invasions as to be only a \"remnant\" of the once powerful nation which oppressed Israel (see on Jeremiah 25:20). The country of Caphtor. Some would render \"the coastland of Caphtor,\" but the idea of \"coast\" seems to be a secondary one, derived in certain passages from the context. Properly speaking, it is a poetic synonym for \"land,\" and is generally applied to distant and (accidentally) maritime countries. \"Caphtor\" was understood by the old versions to be Cappadocia. But as the remains of the Cappadocian language point to a Persian origin of the population which spoke it, and as the Caphtorim originally came from Egypt, it is more plausible to suppose, with Ebers, that Caphtor was a coast district of North Egypt. Crete has also been thought of (comp. Amos 9:7; Genesis 10:14; Deuteronomy 2:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah47:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBaldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - The prophet changes his style. In ecstasy or imagination, he sees the calamity which he has foretold already come to pass. Philistia is not, indeed, altogether annihilated; it was not the will of God to make a full end as yet with any of the nations round about. But it is reduced to extremities, and fears the worst. Verse 5. - Baldness. A sign of the deepest sorrow (comp. on Jeremiah 16:6). Ashkelon is cut off. Ruins of Ashkelon are still visible. \"It is evident that the walls of the old city were built on a semicircular range of rocky hills, which ended in perpendicular cliffs of various heights on the seashore. Wherever nature failed, the weak places were strengthened by the help of earthworks or masonry. On the southern and southeastern sides, the sand has penetrated the city by means of breaches in the walls, and every day it covers the old fortifications more and more, both within and without. The ancient towns alone rise distinctly, like rocky islands, out of the sea of sand. The ruins on the north are bordered by plantations of trees. They lie in such wild confusion that one might suppose that they were thrown down by an earthquake. There is no secure landing place; the strip of sand at the foot of the western wall is covered at high tide, when the waves beat against the cliffs. Still J.G. Kinnear, in 1841, found some remains of a mole, and this discovery is confirmed by Schick [the able German architect now at Jerusalem].\" Thus writes Dr. Guthe, in the Journal of the German Palestine Exploration Society (1880), remarking further that, in a few generations, the ruins of Ashkelon will be buried under the drifting sand. It is partly the sand hills, partly the singular fragmentariness of the ruins of Ashkelon, which gives such an air of desolation to the scene, though, where the deluge of sand has not invaded, the gardens and orchards are luxuriant. Dr. W.M. Thomson, in the enlarged edition of 'The Land and the Book' (London, 1881, p. 173), observes that \"the walls and towers must have been blown to pieces by powder, for not even earthquakes could throw these gigantic masses of masonry into such extraordinary attitudes. No site in this country has so deeply impressed my mind with sadness.\" With the remnant of their valley. \"With\" should rather be \"even.\" \"Their valley\" means primarily the valley of Ashkelon; but this was not different from the valley or low-lying plain (more commonly called the Shefelah) of the other Philistian towns; and the whole phrase is an enigmatical, poetic way of saying \"the still surviving population of Philistia.\" But this addition certainly weakens the passage, and leaves the second half of the verse abnormally short. It is far better to violate the Massoretic tradition, and attach \"the remnant,\" etc., to the second verse half. But \"their valley\" is still a rather feeble expression; a proper name is what we look for to make this clause correspond to those which have gone before. The Septuagint reads differently, for it renders καὶ τὰ κατὰλοιπα Ἐνακείμ. We know from Joshua 11:22 that some of the Anakim were left \"in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod;\" and in David's time the Philistines could still point to giants in their midst (1 Samuel 17:4; 2 Samuel 21:16-22), who, like the Anakim (Deuteronomy 2:20), are called in the Hebrew, Rephaim. It may be objected, indeed (as it is by Keil), that the Anakim would not be traceable so late as Jeremiah's time; but Jeremiah was presumably a learned man, and was as likely to call the Philistines Anakim, as an English poet to call his countrymen Britons. No one who has given special attention to the phenomena of the Hebrew text elsewhere can doubt that \"their valley\" is a corruption; the choice lies between the \"Anakim\" of the Septuagint and the plausible correction of a Jewish scholar (A. Krochmal), \"Ekron.\" How long wilt thou cut thyself? Shall thy lamentation never cease? (comp. on Jeremiah 16:6). The question is in appearance addressed to \"the remnant\" (personified as a woman), but in reality the judicial Providence who sends the calamity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah47:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - O thou sword, etc.; rather, alas! thou sword of the Lord..

Yes; flee, save your lives, if ye can; for your confidences have proved untrustworthy; there is no hope left. Verse 1. - Against Moab; rather, concerning Moab. Nebo! Not, of course, the mountain range referred to in Deuteronomy 32:49 and 34. I as that from which Hoses viewed the land destined for Israel, but a town in the neighbourhood, deriving its name, not from the mountain,but from the same old Semitic (and not merely Babylonian) deity.

Graf thinks of Kir-heres (vers. 31, 36) or Kir-hareseth (another form of the same name; comp. Isaiah 16:7; 2 Kings 3:25), generally identified with Kir-Moab, the chief fortified town of the Moabites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation.

In Heshbon they have devised evil, etc. There is a word play in the Hebrew, which may be reproduced thus: \"In Plot-house they plot evil against it\" (so J. F. Smith's Ewald). Against it (literally, her) means \"against Moab.\" Heshbon was at the time an Ammonitish town (it had in days gone by been Amoritish, Numbers 21:26); see Jeremiah 49:3; but was on the border of Moab. O Madmen. There seems to be again a word play, which has been to some extent reproduced thus: \"Thou shalt become still, O Still house.\" The name Madmen does not occur again, though an allusion to it has been fancied in Isaiah 25:10, where the Hebrew for \"dunghill\" is madmenah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Horonaim.

The mention of Moab in the midst of towns is certainly surprising. We should expect Ar-Moab. Her little ones. The received text, as it stands, is untranslatable, and our choice lies between the correction suggested by the vowel points, and the reading of the Septuagint and a few of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, \"unto Zoar.\" In favour of the latter, which is adopted by Ewald and Graf, it may he urged that Zoar and Horenaim are mentioned together, not only in ver. 34, but also in Isaiah 15:5, which has evidently been imitated in the following verse. It is not quite clear what \"her little ones\" in the first mentioned correction mean. Some think, the children; others, the poor; Hitzig prefers the small towns of Moab. On the site of \"Zoar,\" see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' but compare Canon Tristram in 'The Land of Moab.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For in the going up of Luhith, etc. The verse is substantially taken from Isaiah (Isaiah 15:5), but with variations peculiar to this chapter. The most peculiar of these is that in the first verse half, which is literally, weeping goeth up (not, shall go up) with weeping, which is explained by Dr. Payne Smith to mean \"one set of weeping fugitives pressing close upon another.\" To the present commentator (as also to Delitzsch - see his note on Isaiah 15:5) there seems no reasonable doubt that b'ki, the word rendered \"weeping,\" should rather be bo, \"upon it,\" so that the passage will run, as in Isaiah, \"for the going up of Luhith with weeping doth one go up if,\" Hitzig (whom for once we find agreeing with Delitzsch) remarks that the miswriting b'ki for bo may be easily accounted for by the fact that ki, \"for,\" is the word which follows next. We have no right to ascribe to Jeremiah such an artificial and un-Hebraic an expression as that of the received text. Small as the matter may be in itself, it is not unimportant as suggesting to the Old Testament student a caution against the too unreserved adoption of the canon Lectioni faciliori praestat ardua. In the going down of Horonaim. An interesting variation from Isaiah. The older poet, less attentive to minutiae, had said vaguely, \"in the road to Horonaim;\" by a slight change of expression, the younger and more reflective writer produces a striking antithesis between the ascent to the hill-town, and the descent to the hollow in which Horonaim (\"double cavern\") appears to have been situated. It is possible, however, that Jeremiah has preserved the original reading, and that \"the road\" in Isaiah, l.c., is due to the carelessness of a scribe. The enemies have heard a cry of destruction. But why this reference to the enemies? The rendering, however, is ungrammatical. The text is, literally, the enemies of the cry of destruction have they heard. The prophecy in Isaiah omits \"the enemies of,\" and has a different verb for \"have they heard.\" Can the inserted words be an intrusion from the margin? The later scribes were accustomed to insert glosses in the margin on occasions where we should have thought them entirely unnecessary for the purpose of explanation. But then why \"the enemies of\"? It is an insoluble enigma.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFlee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Flee, save your lives; literally, your souls. The prophet's human feeling prompts him to this counsel; but he knows full well that a life of abject misery is the utmost that can be hoped for. And be like the heath in the wilderness; literally, and (your souls) shall be like destitute ones in the wilderness. Imagine the case of one who has been robbed of everything, and left alone in the desert; not less miserable is that of the Moabite fugitives. The word rendered \"the heath\" (aro'er) is either miswritten for ar'ar, which occurs in the sense of \"destitute\" in Jeremiah 17:6 (see note), or also a rare plural form of the same word. The sense remains the same. It is tempting to see an allusion to one of the towns called Aroer (as in Isaiah 17:2). But the only Aroer the prophet could be thinking of is that on the Amen (Deuteronomy 2:36), which could not be described as \"in the wilderness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In thy works; i.e. either \"in thy evil deeds\" (comp. Isaiah 28:15) or \"in thy idols\" (frequently called \"the work of men's hands,\" e.g. Deuteronomy 4:28, and sometimes simply \"works,\" e.g. Isaiah 41:29; Isaiah 57:12; comp. Isaiah L 31). Chemoah. In Numbers 21:29 Moab is called \"people of Chemosh,\" the patron-god being the king and lord of his people. In accordance with the strictly localizing theory of the nature of deity, current among primitive nations, Chemosh is said to go into captivity together with his worshippers (comp. Jeremiah 49:3; Amos 1:15). This helps us to understand the idolatry into which the Jews fell during the Exile (Isaiah 42:17); they imagined that Jehovah himself was \"in captivity,\" and restrained from putting forth his power on behalf of his worshippers. The text reading is not Chemosh, but Chemish; the latter form does not occur elsewhere, but has been thought to illustrate the name of the Hittite city Carchemish (the Hittites or their predecessors may have been worshippers of this deity), i.e. \"castle of Chemosh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The valley... the plain.

The former means that part of the Jordan valley which borders on this upland \"plain\" towards the west.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-16. - So sudden is the blow that Moab stands in need of wings to make good his escape. Were the human instrument to delay, the curse meant for Moab would come upon himself. Is a reason demanded? It is that Moab has long been in a state of morally perilous security, and requires to be thoroughly shaken and aroused, in order that he may discover the inability of Chemosh to help his worshippers.

The \"youth\" of Moab dates from its subjugation of the aboriginal Emim (Deuteronomy 2:10)' Since that event, though often at war, sometimes tributary and sometimes expelled from a part of the territory claimed by them (see the inscription on the Moabite Stone), yet they had never been disturbed in their ancestral homes to the south of the river Amen. He hath settled on his less. It was the custom to leave wine for a time on its lees or sediment, in order to heighten its strength and flavour (comp. Isaiah 25:6). Emptied from vessel to vessel. Thevenot, an old traveller in Persia, remarks of the Shiraz wine that, after it is separated from the lees, it is apt to grow sour. \"The wine is put into large earthen jars, each holding from ten or twelve to fourteen carabas; but when a jar has been opened, it must be emptied as soon as possible, and the wine put into bottles or carabas, otherwise it spoils and becomes sour\" ('Voyages,' 2:245, quoted by Lowth on Isaiah 25:6). In the application of the figure, the \"taste\" of Moab means obviously the national character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Wanderers, that shall cause him to wander; rather, taters, and they shall tilt him. The earthen jars of which Thevenot speaks were doubtless similar to those of the Israelites. They would be tilted on one side, that the wine might run off clear from the dregs. Their bottles; rather, flagons or pitchers (of earthenware). The confusion of numbers and pronouns is remarkable. First, Moab collectively is spoken of as a wine jar; then the Moabites individually as Moab's jars; last of all, the Moabites are spoken of as possessing \"jars\" (i.e. all the institutions, public and private, of the state and of society).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Ashamed of Bethel; i.e. of the golden calf or bull at Bethel, set up by Jeroboam I. as a symbol of the strong God, Jehovah. This idolatry was odious to the prophetic teachers of a nobler and more spiritual form of religion. They saw that the deity and the symbol were too much confounded, and that such a religion would not save its adherents from captivity and ruin (comp. Hosea 10:15; Amos 3:14; Amos 5:5, 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - We are mighty; rather, we are heroes. The Hebrew is gibborim, the name of David's select warriors (2 Samuel 23:8). The exclamation is designed to represent vividly to the mind the sinful vain glory specially characteristic of Moab.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities. The latter part of this clause in the Hebrew is extremely difficult; the Authorized Version is indefensible. It is even doubtful whether it can be translated at all consistently with grammar, though Hitzig, a good grammarian, has adopted the suggestion of Grotius, rendering, \"and her cities have gone up,\" viz. in smoke, i.e. they have been burnt; comp. Judges 20:40, the end of which verso ought to run thus: \"The whole city went up to heaven.\" But even if the verb in third masc. sing. be allowable after the plural noun, it is very harsh to give it such an interpretation, when the context says nothing about fire or smoke. J.D. Michaelis and Ewald, therefore, propose to change the vowel points of the first word, rendering, \"The spoiler of Moab and of her cities is gone up;\" and Dr. Payne Smith inclines to follow them. We thus obtain a striking antithesis; the enemy has \"gone up,\" and Moab's young men are gone down, i.e. are felled by murderous hands (comp.

Judgment has been passed upon all the cities of Moab, a long roll of whose names is recited. Verse 17. - All ye that are about him; i.e. the neighbouring nations (setup. on Jeremiah 46:14). The invitation to condolence is not ironical, but in the deepest spirit of human sympathy, as in the parallel prophecy in Isaiah (see on Isaiah 15:5).

Rod; as in Psalm 110:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Dibon; now Diban, one of the chief towns of Moab, on two adjacent hills, now covered with ruins (Tristram), in the plain of Medeba (Joshua 13:9), north of Aroer and the Amen. Here the famous Moabite Stone (on which see Dr. Ginsburg's exhaustive monograph), with the inscription of King Mesha (2 Kings 3:4), was found, which, after having been broke up and pieced together, has now found a resting place in the Louvre. It is difficult to say to which Israelitish tribe Dibon was, strictly speaking, attached; for while in Joshua 13:17 it is given to Reuben, in Numbers 32:34 and in the Moabite Stone (line 10) it is assigned to Gad, Apparently the Israelitish population fluctuated. Sometimes Gad was the most adventurous in Occupying Moabitish territory, sometimes Reuben. On the phrase, the daughter, etc., see note on Jeremiah 46:19. The form of the first verse haft is modelled on Isaiah 47:1. Sit in thirst. The expression is unexampled, and it is possible that we should alter one of the vowel points (which constitute no part of the Massoretic text), rendering, \"sit in thirsty (ground),\" i.e. the dust (comp. the parallel passage; Isaiah 47:1). Or there may be a less used collateral form of the Hebrew for \"thirsty\" (came). Canon Tristram speaks of the \"waterless plain\" of Diban ('Land of Moab,' p. 132). Thy strongholds. It appears from the Moabite Stone that Diben was the centre of a district which was reckoned as belonging to it; so at least we may account for the phrase, \"all Dibon was submissive\" (line 28). Compare the phrase in Numbers 21:25, \"Heshbon, and all the villages thereof\" (comp. on Jeremiah 49:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The inhabitants of Aroer will come out in eager expectation to meet the fugitives, and ask, What hath happened? (so the question should be rendered). There were several Aroers (one belonged to the Ammonites, Joshua 13:25), but as the enemy is driving the Moabites southward, the Aroer here intended can only be the town by the Arnon, which separated Moab proper first of all from the kingdom of the Amorites (Deuteronomy 4:48; Joshua 12:2), and afterwards from the territory of the Israelites (Deuteronomy 2:36; Deuteronomy 3:12). The picture drawn in this verse is singularly appropriate to the site of Arnon, \"just by the edge of the arterial highway of Moab,\" and commanding a complete view of the pass of the Arnon (Tristram, 'Land of Moab,' p. 132). There is the same variety of statement as to the Israetitish tribe to which Aroer belonged as in the case of Dibon (see ver. 18). Joshua 13:16 speaks in favour of Reuben; Numbers 32:34 in favour of Gad.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The answer of the fugitives begins in the latter part of this verse, and, continues to ver. 24. Confounded ought, as usual, to be brought to shame. The address, howl and cry, which is in the feminine, refers to Moab, which has just before been spoken of in the feminine (\"It is broken down,\" or rather, \"she is dismayed,\" refers to Moab, not to Dibon). In Arnon; i.e. in the region of the Amen; better, beside Arnon (comp. Jeremiah 13:5, \"by Euphrates\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The plain country. The mishor (see on ver. 8). Holon is not known from other sources. Jahazah (called Jahaz in ver. 34), according to Eusebius, still existed in his days, and lay between Medeba and Dibon. Like Heshbon and Dibon, it was claimed by the Reubenites (Joshua 13:18), and Mesha, in the famous inscription, states that the then King of Israel (Jehoram) \"fortified Jahaz and dwelt in it, when he fought against me\" (lines 18, 19). This was a great but only a temporary success, for Mesha adds that \"Chemosh drove him out before me\" (line 19). Mephaath was apparently near Jahaz, since it is always mentioned with that town (Joshua 13:18; Joshua 21:37; 1 Chronicles 6:79).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Dibon (see on ver. 18).

Perhaps a synonym of Ar, the old capital of Moab (Isaiah 15:1). Hence in Amos 2:2, \"I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth.\" Bozrah. The capital at one time of the Edomites (see Jeremiah 49:13). The ownership of particular cities varied from. time to time in this contested region. Far or near; i.e. towards the frontier or inland.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-35. - And what is Moab's crime? At an earlier point the prophet said that it was the callousness produced by long prosperity (ver. 11); but here another sin is mentioned - Moab's haughty contempt of Jehovah. \"For this it deserves that its contempt should be thrown back upon itself, by its being made, like a drunken man, the scorn of all\" (Ewald). The figure is, no doubt, a coarse one, but not unnatural in the oratory (we must put aside inspiration, which leaves the forms of speech untouched) of a rude people like the Jews. It occurs not unfrequently elsewhere; see especially Isaiah 19:14; Habakkuk 2:15, 16; and, for milder examples of the figure, Jeremiah 13:13 and 25. Verse 26. - Make ye him drunken. The command is issued to the agents of the Divine wrath (comp. vers. 10, 21). He magnified himself against the Lord. Offences against Israel being also offences against Israel's God (see Jephthah's striking words in Judges 11:23, 24). Shall wallow; rather, shall fall heavily (literally, shall clap - a pregnant expression).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Was he found among thieves? for, etc.; rather,... that, as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest thy head. What giveth thee the right to show such scorn and insolent triumph towards Israel, as if he were one who had been arrested in the very act of robbery (comp. Jeremiah 2:26)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Dwell in the rook. Jeremiah probably thinks of the rocky defiles of the Amen, so splendidly adapted for fugitives (see Consul Wetzstein's excursus to the third edition of Delitzsch's 'Jesaja;' he speaks of perpendicular walls of rock). Like the dove (i.e. the wild dove); comp. 'Iliad,' 21:493; 'AEneid,' 5:213.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - These verses are an expansion of Isaiah 16:6. The boastfulness of Moab seems to have much impressed its Israelitish neighbours (comp. vers. 14, 27). It has been thought to be illustrated by the inscription on the Moabite Stone; but we must remember that all national monuments of this sort have a tendency to exaggeration. Verse 29. - We have heard; viz. the prophet and his countrymen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - But it shall not be so, etc. This is a case in which the accentuation must most decidedly be deviated from; it implies a faulty view of the word rendered in the Authorized Version, \"his lies.\" But the rendering of our version is neither in itself tenable nor is it that intended by the accentuation. The rendering suggested by the latter is \"his praters\" (i.e. soothsayers), as the word, no doubt, must be taken in Jeremiah 1:36; Isaiah 44:25. But it is much more natural to render thus: \"And the untruth of his pratings [i.e. of his boastings]; the untruth that they have wrought.\" In his words and in his works (and a word is equal to a work before the Divine Judge) Mesh was essentially \"untrue.\" Truth, in the Biblical sense, is to know and serve the true God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Based upon Isaiah 16:7. Therefore. Moab cannot escape the catastrophe, for his moral basis is utterly insecure. \"Therefore,\" etc. Will I howl. It is at first sight strange that the prophet should speak thus sympathetically after the strong language in ver. 26. But the fact is that an inspired prophet has, as it were, a double personality. Sometimes his human feelings seem quite lost in the consciousness of his message; sometimes (and especially in Jeremiah) the natural, emotional life refuses to be thus restrained, and will have itself expressed. All Moab; i.e. Moab in all its districts, both north and south of the Amen, or, at any rate, the fugitive populations. Mine heart shall mourn. The Authorized Version effaces one of the points of difference between Jeremiah and his original. The former leaves the subject indefinite - one shall mourn. For the men of Kir-heres. Isaiah 16:7 has \"for the raisin cakes of Kir-heres\" (i.e. for the cakes of pressed grapes, for which Kir-heres was specially famous) - a much more expressive phrase. Jeremiah, or his scribe, has changed ashishe into anshe, and the Targum and Septuagint have adopted this weak reading in Isaiah, l.c.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Shortened from Isaiah 16:8, 9. With the weeping of Jaser; rather, more than the weeping of Jazer. This may mean either \"more than I weep for Jazer\" (which is favoured by the insertion of \"for thee\") or more than Jazer weeps\" (for the devastated vineyards of Sibmah); comp. Isaiah, l.c. The site of Jazer is placed by Seetzen between Ramoth (Salt) and Heshbon, where some ruins called Sir are now found. \"Sibmah,\" according to St. Jerome, was not more than half a mile from Heshbon. King Mesha is thought to refer to it under the form Seran, miswritten for Seban (Sebam - so the form should be read - is an Old Testament version of the name; see Numbers 32:3); see inscription on Moabite Stone, line 13. It appears to have been famous for its vineyards; and Seetzen tolls us that grapes and raisins of specially good quality are still carried from the neighbouring Salt to Jerusalem. Thy plants are gone over the sea; rather, thy shoots passed over the sea. The prophet here describes the extensive range of these vines. The northern limit of their culture was Jazer, its southern or western file further shore of \"the sea,\" i.e. the Dead Sea. By a touch of poetic hyperbole the prophet traces the excellence of vines such as those of En-gedi (on the western bank of the Dead Sea) to a Moabitish origin. The reference to the sea of Jazer throws the whole passage into confusion. There is no lake or large pool at present to be found at Jazer, and the simplest explanation is that a scribe repeated the word \"sea\" by mistake. The true text will then be simply,\" they reached unto Jazer.\" The spoiler. Isaiah 16:9 has the more picturesque expression, \"the shouting,\" i.e. the wild battlecry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Nearly identical with Isaiah 16:10. The plentiful field; rather, the garden land; i.e. land planted with \"noble\" plants, especially vines and olives. Wine. Here clearly sweet and unfermented wine (comp. Amos 9:13, 14). None shall tread with shouting. This involves a very harsh construction of the Hebrew, and it is better (considering the numerous other errors of the same kind in the received text) to correct in accordance with Isaiah 16:10,\" the treader shall not tread.\" Their shouting shall be no shouting. \"Shouting\" (Hebrew, hedad) may be taken in two senses:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the cheerful, musical cry with which \"the treaders\" pressed out the juice of the grapes (comp. Jeremiah 25:30);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the wild cry (Jeremiah 51:14) with which the enemy \"fell upon the summer fruits and upon the vintage\" (ver. 32), reducing the inhabitants to abject misery. In Isaiah 16:9, 10 an allusion is made to this double meaning, and so, perhaps, it may be here (\"There shall be shouting, but not that of the peaceful vintagers at their work\"). Or, as others, we may explain \"no shouting\" as equivalent to \"the opposite of shouting,\" i.e. either silence or lamentation (comp. Isaiah 10:15, \"not wood\" equivalent to \"that which is specifically different from wood;\" and Isaiah 31:3, \"not God,\" equivalent to \"the very opposite of Divine\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Based on Isaiah 15:4-6. The cry of one town echoes to another, and is taken up afresh by its terrified inhabitants. Heshbon and Elealeh lay on eminences but a short distance apart, so that the shrill cry of lamentation would be heard far away in the southeast at Jahaz. Zoar and Horonaim both lay in the southern half of Moah (see on vers. 3, 4). An heifer of three years old. If this is the right rendering, the phrase is descriptive of Horonaim, which may, in the time of Jeremiah, have been a \"virgin fortress.\" But the phrase, thus understood, comes in very oddly, and in the parallel passage in Isaiah it stands, not after Horonaim, but after Zoar; it hardly seems likely that there were two Gibraltars in Moab. Another rendering (Ewald, Keil) is, \"(to) the third Eglath.\" This involves an allusion to the fact that there were other places in Moab called Egiath or Eglah, which has been rendered highly probable by Gesenius. The waters also of Nimrhn. Canon Tristram speaks of the \"plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills into the Ghor-en-Numeira.\" Consul Wetzstein, however, says that nature appears there under so unspeakably gloomy an aspect, that the identification is impossible. He proposes a site in the Wady So'eb, about fourteen miles east of the Jordan, which with its luxuriant meadows, covered with the flocks of the Bedouin, is probably suitable to the passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah (Excursus it. in Delitzsch's 'Jesaja,' 4th edit., pp. 572, 573). So also Seetzen, who remarks that the lower part of this wady is still called Nahr Nimrin. In Joshua 13:27 a place called Beth - nimrah is mentioned as situated in the valley (i.e. the Jordan valley); no doubt this was in the wady referred to by the prophets. \"The valley\" seems to have been sometimes used in a wider signification, so as to include lateral valleys like that of Nimrim. The antiquity of the name is shown by its occurrence in the Annals of Thothmos III., who penetrated into the heart of Palestine, and, in the temple of Karnak, enumerates the cities which he conquered. From before B.C. 1600 to nearly A.D. this secluded valley has borne precisely the same name!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Him that offereth in the high places; rather, him that goeth up to a high place. Apparently a reminiscence of Isaiah 15:2 and Isaiah 16:12. As Dr. Payne Smith well remarks, \"The last stage of natural ruin is reached, when thus the rites of religion entirely cease.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36-42. - The description of Moab's lamentations continued. Verse 36. - Based on Isaiah 16:11; Isaiah 15:7. Like pipes. Isaiah has, \"like the harp [or, 'lute'].\" The pipe, or flute, was specially used at funeral ceremonies (Matthew 9:23; Luke 7:32), and therefore, perhaps, seemed to Jeremiah more appropriate. Because the riches, etc. This is, no doubt, what we should have expected, but this is not what Jeremiah wrote; \"because\" should rather be therefore. Jeremiah simply transferred a clause (substantially at least) from his original, Isaiah 15:7, but into a context where it stands rather less naturally. The meaning of the words in Isaiah is that, the desolation being so great, the Moabites shall carry away as much of their goods as they can. In this new context, however, we can only explain this unexpected \"therefore\" by referring to a habit of the Israelitish mind by which that which contributed to a result was regarded as worked purposely for that result. Good instances of this habit are Genesis 18:5; Psalm 45:3; Psalm 51:6; comp. Winer's 'New Testament Grammar' (Clark), pp. 573, 574, especially note 1 on p. 574, though the idiom also occurs in Old Testament passages in which the religious view of life is hardly traceable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 37, 38 (first part). - Based on Isaiah 15:2 (latter part), 3 (first part). On the primitive Arabic, Egyptian, and Hebrew custom of cutting off the hair, see on Jeremiah 16:6, and comp. Herod., 2:36. Clipped. The difference from the word in Isaiah is so slight that it may easily have arisen from a copyist. The meaning is virtually the same. Cuttings. So of Philistia (Jeremiah 47:5); see on Jeremiah 16:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Lamentation generally; literally, all of it is lamentation; i.e. nothing else is to be heard. Like a vessel, etc. For this figure, see on ch. 22:28 (Jeremiah repeats himself).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - They shall howl, saying etc.; rather, How is it dismayed!

Yea, Moab becometh, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 40, 41. - The Septuagint has a shorter form (see introduction to chapter). Verse 40. - He shall fly as an eagle; rather, he shall swoop (same word and figure in Deuteronomy 28:49). The subject is not named, but (as in ch. 46:18) is Nebuchadnezzar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Kerioth is taken. Kerioth has been already mentioned in ver. 24 (see note). Another possible rendering is, The cities are taken, and this certainly agrees better with the parallel line. But a plural of kiryah, a city, does not occur elsewhere. If the identification of Kerioth with Ar-moab, the capital of Moab, be accepted (see on ver. 24), the equalization of Kerioth and \"the strongholds\" seems to be a stumbling block. Strongholds; or, mountain fastnesses (Jeremiah 51:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 43-47. - Hence, as the final result, escape is absolutely impossible, for one can get succeeds another in an endless series The last and greatest danger besots those who seek refuge behind the strong fortifications of Heshbon, It is from this very city that the hottest fire of the enemy breaks forth. Chemosh has not saved his people; and yet there is hope for Moab in the future. Verse 43. - Fear, and the pit, and the snare. An alliteration in the Hebrew, which occurs again in Isaiah 24:17. In German it can be represented better than in English - e.g. by Hitzig's \"grauen, graben, garn.\" All primitive poetry delights in such alliterations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Apparently quoted from memory from Numbers 21:28; Numbers 24:17, except the first clause; the application, however, is peculiar to this passage. They that fled, etc.; rather, The fugitives stand without strength in the shadow of Heshbon. There is a difficulty here, for, according to ver. 2, the hostile raid into Moab started from Heshbon. Surely the fugitives would not think of escaping northwards, much less would they be able to elude the vigilance of the foe and reach Heshbon. But it is not surprising that the author of so long a poem should now and then make a slip; the author of the Book of Job is sometimes inconsistent with the Prologue, and ver. 2 is as far away from the passage before us as the Prologue of Job is from Job 19:18. Nor can we be absolutely certain that our prophecy is exactly as Jeremiah wrote it. Shall come forth; rather, hath come forth (or, cometh forth). From the midst of Sihon. Sihon being, perhaps, regarded as the leader and representative of his warriors. The corner of Moab; rather, the sides (literally, side, used collectively) of Moab. The tumultuous ones; literally, sons of tumult, a poetical phrase for warriors. The prophet has substituted the more common word shaon for its synonym sheth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - Based on Numbers 21:29. The chief difference is in the second half of the verse, in which the bold expression of Chemosh \"giving his sons and his daughters into captivity\" is changed for a mere ordinary and prosaic phrase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah48:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - On the phraseology of this verse (omitted in the Septuagint), see on Jeremiah 29:14; 23:20, and on the brighter prospect held out for Moab, see the analogies given in note on Jeremiah 46:26. Thus far is the judgment of Moab is clearly an editor's note (comp.

Verse 1. - Hath Israel no sons! The violent seizure, perpetrated before his eyes, of parts of the sacred territory, forces the indignant question from the prophet, \"How can these things be?\" It was so on a former occasion (see Jeremiah 2:14), and it is so again, now that the Ammonites are occupying the land of the Gadites. True, the present generation has lost its property, but the next is the heir to all its rights and privileges. Their king; rather, their King - their Melech or Moloch; it is the heavenly, not the earthly king who is referred to (so in Amos 1:15; Zephaniah 1:5). The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, however, read Milcom, which was the name of the Ammonite deity; this is only a different vocalizing of the consonants of the text. The actual vowel points give \"malcam.\" This reading may, of course, be interpreted of the earthly king of the Ammonites. But this view ignores the obvious parallelism of Jeremiah 48:7, \"Chemosh shall go forth into captivity.\" Inherit. The primary meaning of the word is \"to take possession of, especially by force, 1 Kings 21:6\" (Gesenius, ad voc.), and this is the sense evidently required here (comp. Jeremiah 8:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The punishment of Ammon. Its capital, Rabbah (see 2 Samuel 12:26, 27), and the \"daughter\" cities (comp. Numbers 21:25, margin; Joshua 15:45 and Joshua 17:11 in the Hebrew), shall be laid waste. The alarm of war (\"alarm\" equivalent to \"shout\"), as in Jeremiah 4:19. A desolate heap. Fortified towns were built on \"heaps, or slight elevations (comp. on Jeremiah 30:18), the Hebrew name for which (in the singular) is tel. The \"heap\" and the ruins of the town together are aptly called a \"heap of desolation.\" Then shall Israel be heir, etc.; rather, then shall Israel dispossess those who dispossessed him (comp. ver. 1). The form of the phrase reminds us of Isaiah 14:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Heshbon. Here mentioned as de jure a Gadite, but de facto an Ammonitish, town; in Numbers 21:26 it appears as \"the city of Sihon\" the Amorite. In Isaiah 15:4 and Isaiah 16:9 it is reckoned to the Moabites. There was a continual warfare between the neigh-bouring tribes of Reuben and Gad on the one hand, and the Moabites and Ammonites on the other. Let Heshbon lament, because Ai is spoiled. The introduction of At, which is only known to us as a Canaanitish town, near Bethel, on the wrong side of the Jordan for Moab, is startling. It is replied that we have no list of the Ammonitish cities, and that there may have been another town named At. The reply is valid; but loaves a second difficulty untouched, viz. that the mention of a third place destroys the continuity of thought. First, we are made acquainted with the fall of Rabbah; then Heshbon (probably the second place in the country) is called upon to wail because x has been taken by storm; then the populations of the \"daughter\" cities are summoned to join in the lamentation over Rabbah; - is it not reasonable to conclude that the subject of the mourning is one and the same? Now, it is well known that the received text abounds in small errors arising from the confusion of similar Hebrew letters, and that among the letters most easily confounded are yod and resh. Is it not an obvious conclusion that for Ai we should rather read Ar (\"the city\"), a name as suitable for the capital of Ammon as for that of Moab? It is true that we have no example elsewhere of Rabbah being called by the name of Ar; but in 2 Samuel 10:3, 14 it is described as \"the city,\" and we have to be on our guard against the argument a silentio - that favourite weapon of destructive criticism! Since a conjecture must be made, it is more respectful to the prophet to choose the one which is most suitable to the context. Daughters of Rabbah; i.e. unwalled towns (as in ver. 2). Run to and fro by the hedges; rather, by the enclosures; i.e. wander about in the open country, seeking a lodging place in the enclosures of the sheepfolds (so Numbers 32:24, Hebrew) or the vineyards (so Numbers 22:24, Hebrew). Their king; or, Milcom (see on ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The valleys; i.e. long extended plains, such as were suitable for cornfields (Isaiah 17:5; Psalm 65:14), and such as characterized the territory of the Ammonites. Thy flowing valley. \"Flowing;\" that is, abounding with rich crops. The meaning of the phrase, however, is only probable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Ammonitish community dissolved; every one earing for himself. Every man right forth; i.e. straight before him, in a wild panic which expels every thought but that of self-preservation. Him that wandereth. Collectively for \"the wanderers,\" i.e. the fugitives. So it is said of the Babylonians, that they are \"like sheep with none to gather them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Revival of the Ammonites (see on Jeremiah 48:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - A startling picture of the judgment impending over Edom, the severity of which is to be inferred from the behaviour of the sufferers. Observe, no allusion is made by Jeremiah to any special bitter feeling of the Edomites towards the Israelites, such as is implied in Isaiah 34; Ezekiel 35, and other passages. With regard to the fulfilment of the prophecy, we may fairly quote in the first place Malachi 1:2-4. The agents in the desolation there referred to (still fresh in Malachi's recollection) are probably the Nabathaeans (an Arab race, though writing Aramaic), who, after occupying Edom, dropped their nomad habits, devoted themselves to commerce, and founded the kingdom of Arabia Petraea. Meantime the Edomites maintained an independent existence in the midst of the Jewish colonists, till John Hyrcanus compelled them to accept circumcision about B.C. 130. In spite of this enforced religious and political union, the Edomites remained perfectly conscious of their nationality, and we find them mentioned as a distinct factor in the community in Josephus' account of the great Jewish war. They pass away from history after the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. Verse 7. - Teman was celebrated for its \"wisdom,\" i.e. for a practical moral philosophy, similar to that which we find in the less distinctly religions portions of the Book of Proverbs. It was this \"wisdom\" which formed the common element in the higher culture of the Semitic peoples, and of which the sacred narrator speaks when he says that \"Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country\" (1 Kings 4:30). One of Job's friends, Eliphaz, was a Temanite (Job 2:11). From ver. 20, however, it appears that Teman is here used for Edom in general, of which it formed a part. \"Wisdom\" was doubtless cultivated throughout Idumaea (Obadiah 1:8), the \"land of Uz,\" in which Job dwelt, was probably in the east of Edom (see on Jeremiah 25:20). Is their wisdom vanished? The Hebrew, with its characteristic love for material symbols, has, \"Is their wisdom poured out?\" So in Jeremiah 19:7, \"I will pour out [a different word, however, is used] the counsel of Judah.\" The body being regarded as a vessel, it was natural to represent the principle of life, both physical (Isaiah 53:12) and intellectual (as here), under the symbol of a liquid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFlee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Turn back. The grammatical form is peculiar (literally, be made to turn back). If the punctuation is not an oversight the object is to suggest the compulsiveness of the change of route of the Dedanites. Dwell deep; i.e. tarry in the deepest recesses ye can find, so as to avoid the calamities of the Edomites. The Dedanites, it will be remembered, were a tribe devoted to commerce (see on Jeremiah 25:23). Isaiah had already, on an earlier occasion, given the same advice as Jeremiah, viz. to leave the beaten track and take refuge in a less exposed part of the desert, where shrubs and thorn bushes (\"the forest,\" or rather, \"the thickets\") would secure them to some extent from observation (Isaiah 21:13). See, however, ver. 10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If grape gatherers, etc. Jeremiah modifies his original in Obadiah 1:5; the interrogative clauses here become affirmative. Render, If vintagers come to thee, they will not leave any gleanings: if thieves by night, they destroy what is sufficient for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But, etc.; rather, for. The verse gives the reason why the destruction is so complete. \"It is I, Jehovah, who made Esau bare,\" etc. \"Esau,\" i.e. Edom (Genesis 25:30). His seed; i.e. the Edomites. His brethren, or kinsmen; i.e. the Amalekites (Genesis 36:12). His neighbours; i.e. the tribes of Dedan, Terns, and Buz (Jeremiah 25:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLeave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - A merciful mitigation of the prophet's stern threat. The true God will provide for the widows and orphans, if Edom will but commit them to him. And let not Edom think it strange that he is punished; for even Israel, the chosen people, has drunk of the bitter cup. Yea, Jehovah has sworn \"by himself\" that all Edom's cities shall be laid waste. Verse 11. - Leave thy fatherless children, etc. The invitation means more than might be supposed. It is equivalent to a promise of the revival of the Edomitish people (comp. on Jeremiah 46:26; 48:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Whose judgment was not, etc.; rather, to whom it was not due, etc. Jehovah condescends to speak from a human point of view. 'So, in Isaiah 28:21, the punishment of Jerusalem is celled his \"strange work.\" Have assuredly drunken; rather, shall surely drink.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Bozrah. This seems to have been at one time the capital of Edom (see Amos 1:12; Isaiah 34:6; Isaiah 63:1). It was a hill city (comp. on ver. 16); a village called Busaira (i.e. little Bozrah) now stands among its ruins. Perpetual wastes. A phrase characteristic of Jeremiah (see also Jeremiah 25:9) and of the second part of Isaiah (Isaiah 58:12; Isaiah 61:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-18. - Based at first on the older prophecy (see Obadiah 1:1-4); then follow two verses in Jeremiah's peculiar manner. As yet Edom feels himself secure in his rocky home. But a Divine impulse already stirs the nation, through whom Jehovah wills to humble the proud. Edom shall become a second Sodom. Verse 14. - I have heard a rumour. In Obadiah it is \"we have heard,\" i.e. the company of prophets (comp. Isaiah 53:1, \"Who hath believed our report?\" according to one interpretation). Jeremiah, to justify his adoption of the outward form of his prophecy, declares that he is personally responsible for its substance. \"Rumour,\" or as the word is elsewhere rendered, \"report,\" is a technical term for a prophetic revelation (Obadiah 1:1; Isaiah 28:9, 19; Isaiah 53:1; comp. Isaiah 21:10; Isaiah 28:22); and it is from this Old Testament usage that ἀκοή acquires its special meaning in Romans 10:16, 17. In fact, ἀκοή, or bearing, is a more exact equivalent of the original. A prophet is one who has \"listened in the council of God\" (Job 15:8, corrected version; comp. Amos 3:7), and \"when the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who can but prophesy?\" (Amos 3:8). Prophetic perception of Divine truth is so exceptional a thing that it can only be expressed approximately in terms of everyday life. One while it may be called a \"hearing,\" a \"report,\" another while a \"vision\" or \"intuition.\" He who makes to hear or see is, of course, Jehovah, through the objective influence of his Spirit. It is important to study the Biblical phraseology, which has a depth of meaning too often overlooked, owing to the blunter edge which time has given to our modern speech. An ambassador; rather, a herald. Unto the heathen; rather, unto the nations. There is no religious idea involved; the word goyim literally means \"nations,\" and there is no reason for deviating from the primary sense. In the next verse it is even more necessary to make this correction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thy terribleness. This is certainly the best rendering of this ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. The \"terribleness\" of Edom consisted in the fact that the other nations shrank from disturbing her in her rocky fastness. In the clefts of the rock. Probably with an allusion to the rock city Sela, or Petra (\"rock\"); as perhaps in \"the height of the hill\" to the situation of Bozrah; see on ver. 13 (Graf). As the eagle. Not any eagle is meant, but the griffon (Gypsfulvus), or great vulture (Tristram).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A desolation; rather, an astonishment. The word is from the same root as the following verb. The phrase is characteristic of Jeremiah, who has no scruple in repeating a forcible expression, and so enforcing an important truth (comp. Jeremiah 25:11, 38; Jeremiah 50:23; Jeremiah 51:43). What so \"astonishing\" as the reverses of once flourishing kingdoms! For the Bible knows nothing of the \"necessity\" of the decay and death of nations. The \"covenant\" which Jehovah offers contains the pledge of indestructibility. Everyone that goeth by it, etc. Another self-reminiscence (see Jeremiah 19:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - As in the overthrow, etc.; comp. Deuteronomy 29:2, which explains the reference in \"the neighbour cities\" (Admah and Zeboim). The verse is repeated in Jeremiah 50:40; It does not, of course, mean that rite and brimstone should be the agents of destruction (nor is even Isaiah 34:9 to be understood literally), but that the desolate appearance of Edom should remind of that of the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea (comp. Isaiah 13:19; Amos 4:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-22. - Figures descriptive of the unique physical qualities of the destined conqueror of Edom. Both figures have been used before (see Jeremiah 4:7; Jeremiah 48:40). Verse 19. - He shall some. The subject is withheld, as in ch. 46:18 (see note); 48:40. The swelling of Jordan; rather, the pride of Jordan; i.e. the luxuriant thickets on its banks. See on Jeremiah 12:5, where the phrase first occurs. Against the habitation of the strong; rather, to the evergreen pasture. The word rendered \"evergreen\" is one of those which are the despair of interpreters, from their fulness of meaning. The root-meaning is simply \"continuance,\" whether it be continuance of strength (comp. Micah 6:2, Hebrew) or of the flow of a stream (Deuteronomy 21:4; Amos 5:24), or, as here, of the perennial verdure of a well watered pasturage. But I will suddenly make him run away from her. Make whom? The lion? Such is the natural inference from the Authorized Version, but the context absolutely forbids it. It seems useless to mention the crowd of explanations which have been offered of this \"obscure and much-vexed passage,\" as old Matthew Poole calls it, since in Jeremiah 50:44 we have precisely the same phrase, but with another suffix, which clears up the meaning. We may, therefore, either read (with the Septuagint and the Syriac Version), \"For I will suddenly make them run away from it\" (viz. the pasture), or keep the old reading \"him\" for \"them,\" and explain \"him\" as meaning the Edomites. The expression used for \"suddenly\" is very forcible; we might render, with Ewald, \"in the twinkling of an eye.\" And who is a chosen man, etc.? A still more difficult clause. If the text is correct, which cannot be assumed as certain, we should probably render, with Ewald, \"and will appoint over it [i.e. the land of Edom] him who is chosen,\" viz. Nebuchadnezzar. Who will appoint me the time? The same phrase is rendered in Job 9:19, \"Who shall set me a time to plead?\" (comp. the Latin phrase dicur dicere). To drag a defendant before the tribunal implies equality of rank. One might venture to do this with Nebuchadnezzar, if he were not the representative of One still mightier. Finally, Who is that shepherd that will stand before me? The land of Edom has been likened to a pasture; it is natural that the ruler should be now described as a shepherd (comp. Jeremiah 29:34)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The counsel of the Lord. At first sight this appears to detract from the perfection of Jehovah. But another prophet declares that the Divine \"counsels\" are \"framed\" from eternity (Isaiah 22:11; Isaiah 37:26). Surely the least, etc.; rather, Surely they shall drag them along, the weak ones of the flock; surely their pasture shall be appalled at them. Such is the sad fate of the sheep, now that the resistance of their shepherd has been overpowered. \"The weak ones of the flock\" is a phrase quite in Jeremiah's manner; its opposite is \"the noble ones of the flock\" (Jeremiah 25:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Is moved; rather, quaketh (as Jeremiah 8:16). It is a pity that the Authorized Version has not preserved the present tense throughout the verse. The prophet seems to see his prediction realized before him. In the Red Sea; rather, beside the Bed Sea; comp. 1 Kings 9:26, \"Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Behold, he shall come up... Bozrah. Repeated from Jeremiah 48:40, with the substitution of \"Bozrah\" for \"Moab,\" and the addition of \"and he shall come up\" from ver. 19. For \"Bozrah,\" see on ver. 13. And at that day. Repeated from Jeremiah 48:41 (latter half), with the exception that \"Edom\" stands for \"Moab.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-27. - The heading Concerning Damascus is too limited (like that of the partly parallel prophecy in Isaiah 17:1-11); for the prophecy relates, not only to Damascus, the capital of the kingdom of southeastern Aram (or Syria), but to Hamath, the capital of the northern kingdom. (The third of the Aramaean kingdoms, that of Zobah, had ceased to exist.) Damascus had already been threatened by Amos (Amos 1:3-5), and by Isaiah (Isaiah 17:1-11). We may infer from the prophecy that Damascus had provoked the hostility of Nebuchadnezzar, but we have as yet no monumental evidence as to the facts. Verse 23. - Hamath. Still an important city under the name of Hamah, situated to the north of Hums (Emesa), on the Orontes. It formed nominally the boundary of the kingdom of Israel (Numbers 34:8; Joshua 13:5), was actually a part of the empire of Solomon (2 Chronicles 8:4), and was conquered for a short time by Jeroboam II. (2 Kings 14:25). Under Sargon it was fully incorporated into the Assyrian empire (comp. Isaiah 10:9); rebellious populations were repeatedly transplanted into the territory of Hamath. Arpad. Always mentioned together with Hamath, whose fate it appears to have shared (Isaiah 10:9). A tell, or hill, with ruins, about three (German) miles from Aleppo, still bears the name Erfad (Zeitschrift of the German Oriental Society, 25:655). There is sorrow on the sea, etc.; i.e. even the sea participates in the agitation of that troublous time: somewhat as in Habakkuk 3:10 the sea is represented as sympathizing in the terror produced by a Divine manifestation. But by the slightest possible emendation (viz. of caph into beth) we obtain a more natural sense - \"with an unrest as of the sea, which cannot be quiet.\" In Isaiah 57:20 we read, \"For the ungodly are like the troubled sea, for it cannot be quiet;\" and it can hardly be doubted that Jeremiah is alluding to this passage. If he altered it at all, it would be in the direction of greater smoothness rather than the reverse. Not a few manuscripts of Jeremiah actually have this corrected reading, which should probably be adopted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDamascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Hew is the city of praise not left, etc.! A difficult passage. The construction, indeed, is plain. \"How is not,\" etc. I can only mean \"How is it that the city of praise is not,\" etc.?(comp. 2 Samuel 1:14). The difficulty lies in the word rendered \"left.\" The ordinary meaning of the verb, when applied to cities, is certainly \"to leave without inhabitants;\" e.g. Jeremiah 4:29; Isaiah 7:16; Isaiah 32:14. This, however, does not suit the context, which shows that \"the daughter of Damascus\" personified is the speaker, so that ver. 25 ought rather to mean, \"How is it that the city of praise is [not, 'is not'] forsaken?\" Either, then, we must suppose that \"not\" has been inserted by mistake - a too arbitrary step, seeing that there is no negative in the context to account for the insertion (the case is different, therefore, from Job 21:30; Job 27:15, where such an insertion is at any rate justifiable); or else we must give uzzebhah the sense of \"let go free\" (comp. Exodus 23:5; Deuteronomy 32:36; Job 10:1). It is the obstinate incredulity of love which refuses to admit the possibility of the destruction of the loved object. The city of praise. The city which is my \"praise,\" or boast. Few cities, in fact, have had so long and brilliant an existence as Damascus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And I will kindly, etc. A combination of clauses from Amos 1:14 and Amos 1:4. Three several kings of Damascus bore the name of Ben-hadad: one the contemporary of King Baasha of Samaria; another, of Ahab; a third, of Joash. (Ben-hadad, however, should rather be Ben-hadar, agreeably to the Assyrian inscriptions and the Septuagint.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-33. - Against the nomad and partly settled Arabs - the former described under the name Kedar (see on Jeremiah 2:10), the latter under that of Hazor (connected with hazer, an unwalled village; comp. Leviticus 25:31). This use of Hazer is remarkable; elsewhere the name denotes towns in Palestine (Joshua 11:1; Joshua 15:23; Nehemiah 11:33). There are two plainly marked strophes, vers. 28-30 and 31-33, both beginning with a summons to the foe to take the field. Verse 28. - Hazer (i.e. the settled Arabs) is said to have kingdoms. \"King\" is used in Hebrew in a wider sense than we are accustomed to (comp. Jeremiah 25:24, \"All the kings of Arabia\"). The \"kings\" of Hazer would be mere sheikhs or emirs. Shall smite; rather, smote. There is no justification whatever for the future. The statement is obviously a later addition, to show that the prophecy was fulfilled. On the form \"Nebuchadrezzar,\" see on Jeremiah 21:2. The men of the east. A general designation of the inhabitants of all the countries in the east of Palestine (Genesis 29:1; Judges 6:3; Job 1:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - All the possessions of the nomad are here mentioned - first his tents and his flocks; then the hangings of which the tent is composed (Jeremiah 4:20; Jeremiah 10:20), and the vessels which it contains; and finally the camels which the Arab rides, not to mention their other uses. All this shall be ruthlessly appropriated by the Chaldean invaders. Fear is on every side. Again Jeremiah's motto recurs (see on Jeremiah 6:25). It expresses here, not the war cry itself, but the result produced by it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFlee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The prophet turns to the Arabs in villages who have still more to tempt the cupidity of plunderers, and urges them to flee while there is still time. Dwell deep (see on ver. 8). Against you. This is the reading of the Septuagint (Alex. MS.), the Targum, the Vulgate, and many extant Hebrew manuscripts. The received text, however, has \"against them.\" Such alternations of person have met us again and again, and there is no occasion to doubt the ordinary reading.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - How easy is the expedition to which the Chaldean army is invited! - it is a mere holiday march. Resistance is impossible, for an enemy has never been dreamed cf. The tribes of Hazer are not, indeed, a wealthy nation, for they have but little wealth to tempt either the conqueror or the merchant; they \"live alone;\" they are an uncommercial and unwarlike, but a profoundly \"tranquil, nation, that dwelleth securely [or, 'confidently']\" - a description reminding us of Judges 8:7; Ezekiel 38:11. In their idyllic, patriarchal state they feel no need of walls with their accompanying double gates (the gates of ancient cities were so large that they were divided) and bars. Like Israel in the prophetic vision (Numbers 23:9), \"they dwell alone.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Them that are in the utmost corners. Another of Jeremiah's characteristic phrases, which should rather be tendered, the corner clipped (i.e. having the hair cut off about the ears and temples; see on Jeremiah 9:26). From all sides. \"Nebuchadnezzar will so arrange his troops that the Bedaween [but the people of Hazer were not Bedaween, i.e. desert Arabs] will be surrounded on all sides, and, being thus unable to escape in a body, will be scattered to 'all the winds,' to the four quarters of the earth\" (Dr. Payne Smith).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The same fate predicted for Hazor as for Edom (ver. 18). Dragons; rather, jackals (see on Jeremiah 10:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34-39. - Concerning Elam. The title places this prophecy later than these in Jeremiah 48:1-49:33; viz. at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah. From this filet, and from the absence of any reference to Nebuchadnezzar as the instrument of Elam's humiliation, Ewald conjectures that the Elamites had been concerned in the events which led to the dethronement and captivity of Jehoiachin. Dr. Payne Smith is inclined to accept this hypothesis, remarking that the Elamites \"appear perpetually as the allies of Merodach-baladan and his sons in their struggles for independence.\" We are not yet, however, in possession of information as to the relations of Elam to the great Babylonian empire which rose upon the ruins of the Assyrian. Ewald's conjecture is a possibility, and no more. And what was Elam? One of the most ancient kingdoms in the world (see Genesis 14.). Geographically it was the tract of country., partly mountainous, partly lowland, lying south of Assyria and east of Persia proper, to which Herodotus gives the name of Cissia, and the classical geographers that of Tusis or Tusiaua. This is clear, says Sehrader, from the Persian text of the Behistun inscription of Darius. It is fro-quently mentioned under the name \"Ilam,\" or \"Ilamti,\" in the Assyrian inscriptions, especially in those of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Assurbauipal. In B.C 721 Sargon states that he annexed a district or province of Elam (and hence, perhaps, we must explain the mention of the Elamites in the Assyrian army in Isaiah 22:6), which was, doubtless, one cause of the embittered feeling towards Assyria of the portion which remained independent. The annals of the heroic struggle of Merodach-baladan contain repeated reference to the King of Elam. Assurbanipal made no less than three invasions of Elam, and the singular pretext for the third is, curiously enough, associated with the remarkable fourteenth chapter of Genesis. It was this - that the Elamite king had refused to deliver up an image of the goddess Nana, which Kudur-nankhundi, an ancient Elamite monarch, had carried oft, and which had remained 1635 or (perhaps) 1535 years in Elam. This king has been plausibly conjectured to be a member of the same dynasty as \"Chedorlaomer [ = Kudur-Lagamar] King of Elam.\" This time it was all over with Elam; Shushan itself was plundered and destroyed, and far and wide the country was laid waste. That so restless and courageous a people should have become famous among the surrounding nations was only to be expected; and it is a striking proof of this that Ezekiel, in describing the companions whom fallen Egypt would meet with in Hades, mentions \"Elam and all her multitude\" (Ezekiel 32:24). The fact that the Septuagint has the heading twice over - first very briefly (in Jeremiah 25:14, where it is followed by this prophecy), and then at full length (in Jeremiah 26:1, at the end of the prophecy of Elam) - has been variously explained. It is, at any rate, clear that there is some confusion in the present text of this translation. In connection with this prediction it is interesting to notice one of the results of a new cuneiform discovery among some tablets acquired in 1878 by the British Museum. At the very time when Nebuchadnezzar was taking an oath of allegiance from Zedekiah, he was also engaged in hostilities against Elam. \"We do not know,\" says Mr. Pinches, \"what brought the Babylonians into hostilities with the Elamites, but the result of the expedition was to bring the whole kingdom of Elam within the boundaries of the Babylonian monarchy\" (Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, 7:214).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The bow of Elam. So Isaiah in prophetic vision, \"And Elam bare the quiver\" (Isaiah 22:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - An emblem of the utter hopelessness of escape. The four winds (figuratively spoken of by Zechariah (Zechariah 6:5) as \"presenting themselves\" before God, to receive his commissions) shall combine their forces to scatter the doomed nation. The outcasts of Elam. This is the marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible; the text has, \"the perpetual outcasts.\" No philological eye can doubt that the correction should be admitted (a yod for a vav).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - I will set my throne; i.e. my tribunal (as Jeremiah 43:10). The king and the princes; rather, king and princes. The threat is not merely that the reigning king shall be dethroned, but that Elam shall lose its native rulers altogether.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah49:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - But... in the latter days; i.e. presumably in the Messianic age. Into the fulfilment of this promise we need not inquire in too prosaic a spirit. It is true that \"Elamites\" are mentioned among the persons present on the great \"day of Pentecost\" (Acts 2:9). But this would be a meagre fulfilment indeed. The fact is that, both in the narrative in the Acts and in this prophecy, the Elamites are chiefly mentioned as representatives of the distant and less civilized Gentile nations, and the fulfilment is granted whenever a similar people to the Elamites is brought to the knowledge of the true religion.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - The form and structure of the translation require a change. Render, If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, wilt return unto me; and if thou wilt put away, etc., and not wander; and wilt swear, As Jehovah liveth, with good faith, with justice, and with righteousness; then shall the nations bless themselves by him, and in him shall they glory. The clause, \"and not wander,\" seems too short; the Septuagint had a choicer reading, \"and put away, etc., from his [thy] mouth, and not wander from before me.\" It is the close of the prophecy which we have here. The prophet subjoins a promise which he has heard from Jehovah. True, it does not appeal to Israel's self-love (as Isaiah 48:18, 19; Psalm 81:13-16), but to a nobler feeling of responsibility for the world's welfare. Israel has been entrusted with a mission, and on the due performance of this mission hangs the weal or woe of humanity. Hence Jehovah's longing for Israel's repentance. If Israel will but \"return,\" and obey God's commandments, all nations will be attracted to the true religion. The form of expression used for the latter statement is borrowed probably from Genesis 22:18; Genesis 26:4 (it is less closely parallel with Genesis 12:3; Genesis 18:18). To \"bless by\" any one is to use his name in the benediction formula. Seeing Israel so blessed through his allegiance to Jehovah, all nations shall wish themselves a similar blessing (the reverse of the process in Jeremiah 29:22; comp. Isaiah 65:16). To \"swear, As Jehovah liveth,\" means to call Jehovah to witness to the truth of a statement. This is to be done \"with good faith,\" etc., i.e. the object of the oath must be consistent with honesty and probity. Abominations; i.e. idols, as often (see 2 Kings 23:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - There is no occasion to separate vers. 3, 4, from the preceding prophecy. We have other instances of as sudden a transition from the Israelites (in the narrower sense) to the men of Judah (see Isaiah 8:6-14; Isaiah 10:1-4; Isaiah 28:1-6; in the writer's commentary). For thus, etc. \"For\" is here not causal, but explanatory: \"I say this not only to the men of Israel, but to you, O men of Judah, who need the admonition to repentance, how deeply!\" (see Jeremiah 5:2). Break up your fallow ground; the same figure as in Hosea 10:12. To understand it we must read the clause in connection with the following one. Sow not among thorns. The prophet means, though he does not say so, the roots which will spring up into thorns. \"Do not plant your good resolutions in a heart filled up with the roots of thorns, but first rake up the soil, and clear it of noxious germs, and then sow the seed which will grow up in a holy life\" (comp. Matthew 13:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCircumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Circumcise yourselves to the Lord. A significant passage. All the Jews were circumcised, but not all were \"circumcised to the Lord.\" There were but too many who were \"circumcised in uncircumcision\" (Jeremiah 9:25), and the prophet sternly reduces ouch circumcision to the level of the heathenish rite of cutting off the hair (Jeremiah 9:26; comp. Herod. 3:8). Jeremiah seems to have been specially anxious to counteract a merely formal, ritualistic notion of circumcision, sharing in this, as in other points, the influence of the Book of Deuteronomy, so lately found in the temple (comp. Deuteronomy 10:16). To him the venerable rite of circumcision (older, certainly, than Abraham) is a symbol of the devotion of the heart to its rightful Lord (comp. St. Paul in Romans 2:28, 29; Colossians 2:11; Philippians 3:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeclare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-31. - A revelation of grievous purport has suddenly reached the prophet. See how the foe draws nearer and nearer, and how alarm drives the scattered population to seek for refuge in the fortified cities. Can such be the issue of the promises of peace with which Jehovah has encouraged his people? Such are the contents of the first paragraph (vers. 5-10). Next,-in short, detached figures the prophet sets forth the sin of the people and its punishment. Like a scorching simoom is the former; like swift clouds, and like a whirlwind, is the onward march of the instruments of the latter. Swift, indeed, must repentance be, if it is to outrun punishment. For the northern peoples are already here (vers. 11-18). The impression is so strong on the mind of the prophet that he vents himself in language such as the last man might employ on the morrow of the final judgment day (vers. 19-26). And now, \"lest what precedes might seem only poetry\" (Payne Smith), the Divine decree is solemnly announced. The judgment is irrevocable; but there is a gleam of hope: \"I will not make a full end.\" On the question whether the Scythians or the Baby-Ionians are mainly alluded to, see Introduction.) Verse 5. - Cry, gather together; rather, cry aloud.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSet up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Set up the standard. The \"standard\" was a tall pole with a flag, pointing in the direction of Zion, for the guidance of fugitives. Retire, stay not; rather, save your goods by flight; linger not. The former verb occurs again in the same sense in Exodus 9:19; Isaiah 10:31. From the north. The expression suits either the Scythians or the Chaldeans (see on Jeremiah 1:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The lion; the symbol of irresistible might and royalty (Genesis 49:7; Revelation 5:5). Of the Gentiles; rather, of the nations. There is no reference to the distinction between Jews and Gentiles; the Jews themselves are not allowed to escape. An ordinary lion attacks individual men; this lion destroys nations. Is on his way; literally, has broken up his encampment - a phrase perhaps suggested by the nomad Scythiaus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Is not turned back from us. As we in our folly believed (Jeremiah 2:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The heart... shall perish; i.e. they shall lose their reason. The same verb in Ethiopic means \"to be mad.\" The \"heart\" in Old Testament language is the center of the intellectual as well as of the moral life (comp. Hosea 4:11; Job 12:24; Proverbs 15:28). So St. Ephrem the Syrian says ('Works,' in Syriac, 2:316, quoted by Delitzsch), \"The reason expatiates in the heart as in a palace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ah, Lord God! rather, Alas! O Lord Jehovah (see on Jeremiah 1:6). Thou hast greatly deceived this people, etc. Much difficulty has been felt in interpreting this verse, partly because it seems directly to charge Jehovah with \"deceit,\" and partly because the prophecy, Ye shall have peace, on which this charge is founded, accords exactly with the strain of the \"false prophets\" (see Jeremiah 6:14; Jeremiah 14:13; Jeremiah 23:17). Hence some (e.g., Ewald) have altered the points of the verb at the beginning of the verse., so as to enable them to render. \"And one shall say,\" the subject understood being either a \"false prophet\" or one of the people. This view is not in itself impossible (Keil's objection will not bear examination), but is not absolutely necessary, for the present is not the only passage in which Jeremiah, under the influence of strong emotion, charges Jehovah with \"deceit\" (see Jeremiah 20:7, a synonymous word is used; and comp. 1 Kings 22:23), and the words, \"Ye shall have peace, may be meant to summarize the cheering promises in Jeremiah 3:14-18. Jeremiah may (it is not incorrect to conjecture) have supposed the fulfillment of his prophecy to be nearer than it really was (comp. 1 Peter 1:11); hence his disappointment, and hence his strong language. So St. Jerome, \"Quia supra dixerat, In illo tempore vocabunt Jerusalem solium Dei, etc.. et nunc dicit, Peribit cor regis, turbatur propheta et in se Deum putat esse meutitum; nec intelligit, illud multa post tempera repromissum, hoc autem vicino futurum tempore.\" To suppose, with Keil, that Jeremiah refers the prophecies of the \"false prophets\" to God as their ultimate Author, seems inconsistent with Jeremiah's own statements in Jeremiah 14:14 (comp. Jeremiah 5:13). Moreover, we have parallels elsewhere in the prophets, as well as in the Book of Job, for the use of language with regard to Providence which a calmer judgment would condemn. A notable instance is Isaiah 63:17, where the Jewish Church, through its mouthpiece the prophet, throws the responsibility of its errors upon Jehovah. Depressed by melancholy, they give way for the moment to those human \"thoughts\" which are not as \"My thoughts.\" They felt the \"burden of the mystery.\" Unto the soul; i.e. unto the life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall it be said to this people; i.e. words like these may be used with reference to this people. A dry wind, etc.; literally, a clear wind (but the notions of dryness and heat are closely connected with that of heat; comp. Isaiah 18:4). The prophet doubtless means the east wind, which is very violent in Palestine, and, of course, quite unsuitable for the winnowing process. High places should rather be bare hills. Toward; or (is) the way cf. So Hitzig, supposing the conduct of the Jews to be likened to a wind which brings no blessing, but only drought and desolation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Even a full wind from those places. The passage is obscure, but this is a very possible rendering. \"Full,\" equivalent to \"violent;\" \"those (places),\" equivalent to the bare hills spoken of in ver. 11. Keil and Payne Smith, however, render, \"a fuller wind than those,\" i.e. a more violent wind than those which serve for winnowing the corn; while Hitzig (see on ver. 11) supposes \"from those\" to mean the persons described in ver. 11 as \"the daughter of my people.\" Unto me; or perhaps for me, at my beck and call. Now also will I, etc. We must supply the other term of the antithesis from the context: \"As they have sinned against me, so will I also now hold a court of justice upon them\" (see on Jeremiah 1:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He shall come up as clouds, etc. It is needless to name the subject; who can it be but the host of Jehovah's warlike instruments? (For the first figure, comp. Ezekiel 38:16; for the second, Isaiah 5:28; Isaiah 66:15; and for the third, Habakkuk 1:8; Deuteronomy 28:49.) Woe unto us! etc. The cry of lamentation of the Jews (comp. ver. 20; Jeremiah 9:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thy vain thoughts. The phrase specially belongs to sins against one's neighbor - such sins as are described in Jeremiah 7:5-9 (Keil). \"Vain\" should rather be \"wicked\" (immoral); the root-meaning of the noun is \"a breath\" (the symbol of material or moral emptiness).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For a voice declareth, etc. There is no time to lose, for already news of the foe has arrived. He is now at Dan, the northern frontier-town, and is heard of almost as soon in the hill-country of Ephraim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Make ye mention, etc. This verse contains a call to the neighboring nations to take notice of an event which nearly concerns them all. True, it is only the investment of Jerusalem which can as yet be reported, but there can hardly be a doubt of the issue, and the capture of the principal fortress will at once be followed by that of the other fortified \"cities of Judah.\" Against in the second clause should rather be concerning. (For the use of \"behold\" before an imperative, comp. Psalm 134:1.) Watchers; i.e. besiegers (comp. ver. 17), who like the panther lie in wait for every one who comes out of the city, to kill him (Jeremiah 5:6; comp. Jeremiah 6:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - As keepers of a field. The prophet compares the tents, or perhaps the booths (1 Kings 20:12, 16), of the besieging army to the booths of the guardians of the crepe (Isaiah 1:8; Job 27:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - This is thy wickedness; i.e. the effect of thy wickedness.

I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - My bowels. It is doubted whether the speaker in vers. 19-21 is the prophet or the whole nation. Ver. 19 reminds us of Isaiah 15:5; Isaiah 16:11 and Isaiah 21:3, 4, and would be quite in harmony with the elegiac tone of our prophet elsewhere; the Targum too already regards the passage as an exclamation of the prophet. On the other hand, the phrase \"my tents\" (ver. 20) certainly implies that the people, or the pious section of the people, is the speaker. Both views may perhaps be united. The prophet may be the speaker in ver. 19, but simply (as is the case with so many of the psalmists) as the representative of his fellow-believers, whom in ver. 20 he brings on the stage more directly. Ver. 19 is best rendered as a series of exclamations -NEWLINENEWLINE\"My bowels! my bowels! I must writhe in pain!NEWLINEThe walls of my heart! My heart moaneth unto me!NEWLINEI cannot hold my peace!NEWLINEFor thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,NEWLINEThe alarm of war!\" Observe, the \"soul\" hears; the \"heart\" is pained. So generally the one is more active, the other more passive. The Hebrew margin gives, for \"I must writhe,\" \"I must wait\" (comp. Micah 7:7); but this rendering does not suit the context. The walls of my heart. A poetical way of saying, \"My heart beats.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDestruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - My tents. Jeremiah uses a similar phrase in Jeremiah 30:18 (scrap. also 2 Samuel 20:1; 1 Kings 8:66; 1 Kings 12:16; Psalm 132:3; also Isaiah 29:1, \"city where David encamped, i.e. dwelt\"). The expression is evidently a \"survival\" of the nomadic, tent-dwelling age. (Comp. the parallel phrase, \"my curtains,\" i.e. my tent-curtains; comp. Jeremiah 10:20; Isaiah 54:2; Song of Solomon 1:5.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Shall I see the standard. (See on ver. 6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For my people is foolish. The Lord gives no direct answer to the complaining question in ver. 21. He simply states the moral ground for Judah's calamity, and implies that this will last so long as the people continue to be \"foolish,\" i.e. virtual deniers of the true God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I beheld. The prophet is again the speaker, but in a calmer mood. God's judgment has been pronounced, and it is not for him to rebel. He has now simply to record the vision of woe which has been granted him. He foresees the utter desolation into which not only the land of Judah, but the earth in general, will be brought, and which reminds him of nothing so much as the \"waste and wild\" condition of the earth previous to the first creative word. But why is \"the earth\" mentioned in this connection? Because the judgment upon Judah is but one act in the great general judgment which, when completed, will issue in a fresh order of things (comp. Isaiah 3:14, 15, where side by side are mentioned Jehovah's judgment of \"the peoples\" and of \"his people,\" and Isaiah 24, where the judgment upon the enemies of Israel is interwoven with the judgment upon \"the earth\"). Without form, and void; rather, waste and wild (to represent in some degree the characteristic assonance of the original - tohu va-bohu); more literally, immovable and lifeless. It is the phrase used in Genesis L 2 for primeval chaos. Tohu and bohu occur in parallel lines in Isaiah 34:11, to express utter desolation; tohu alone five times in the Book of Isaiah, and once in Job. They had no light. The heavens were in the same condition as on the third day, subsequently to the creation of the heavens, but prior to that of the luminaries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Moved lightly; rather, moved to and fro.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The fruitful place; rather, the garden-land (see on Jeremiah 2:7). Not \"the Carmel\" (Keil, Payne Smith) for the context refers to the whole of the country, not to any single tract. The article before the two appellatives is the generic. At the presence of; rather, by reason of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The vision breaks off, and the prophet emphasizes its truthfulness by the announcement of the Divine decree. \"Desolation, and yet not a full end,\" is its burden. This is the same doctrine of the\" remnant\" which formed so important a part of the prophetic message of Isaiah and his contemporaries. However severe the punishment of Judah may be, there will be a \"remnant\" which shall escape, and become the seed of a holier nation (Amos 9:8; Isaiah 4:2; Isaiah 6:13; Isaiah 10:20; Isaiah 11:11; Hosea 6:1, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - For this; i.e. because of the impending judgment. Be black. \"To be black\" is equivalent to \"to put on mourning\" (comp. Jeremiah 8:21; Jeremiah 14:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The whole city. The reading of which this is a version can hardly be the right one; for \"the whole city\" can only be Jerusalem, and in ver. 6 the people outside are bidden to take refuge in the capital. Hence Ewald, Hitzig, and Payne Smith (after Septuagint, Targum) would slightly amend the word rendered \"city,\" so as to translate \"the whole land\" (of Judah). Shall flee; literally, fleeth. So afterwards render, \"have gone.... is forsaken,\" \"dwelleth.\" It is a vivid dramatic representation of the effects of the invasion. Bowmen. It is singular that Herodotus should say nothing about the use of the bow by the Chaldeans. But the monuments give ample evidence that they were a people of archers. So of course were the Scythians, as Herodotus testifies. The rooks; i.e. the limestone caverns which abound in Palestine, and which were frequently used as strongholds and hiding-places (see Judges 6:2; Judges 15:8; 1 Samuel 13:6; 1 Samuel 14:11; 1 Samuel 24:3 (especially); 1 Kings 18:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do?

All these arts are in vain, for a violent repulsion has converted her lovers into her deadly enemies. And when Jerusalem is \"spoiled,\" or taken by storm, what device will there be left to attempt? The \"lovers\" are the foreign powers to whom the Jews paid court (Jeremiah 2:18, 36, 87). Though thou rentest thy face, etc; alluding to the custom of Eastern women, who try to make their eyes seem larger by putting powdered antimony (the Arabic kohl) upon their eyelids. So, for instance, did Jezebel (see 2 Kings 11:30); and one of Job's daughters received the name Keren-happuch, \"box of antimony,\" i.e. one who sets off the company in which she is, as antimony does the eye. An old author, Dr. Shaw, writes thus: \"None of these ladies take themselves to be completely dressed till they have tinged the hair and edges of their eyelids with the powder of lead ore. And as this operation is performed by dipping first into this powder a small wooden bodkin of the thickness of a quill, and then drawing it afterwards through the eyelids over the ball of the eye, we have a lively image of what the prophet (Jeremiah 4:30) may be supposed to mean\" (Shaw, 'Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 229).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For I have heard a voice, etc. This explains the preceding statement, \"They will seek thy life.\" It is this murderous plot which calls forth the \"cry as of a woman in pangs.\" Bewaileth herself; rather, sigheth deeply. Her hands; literally, her palms.

Verses 2, 3. - The prophet, with the eye of faith, sees his revelation accomplished. Babylon (like Moab) is taken; her idols are destroyed. In his exuberant joy, he calls on the bystanders to proclaim the good news to the sympathetic nations, and to set up (or rather, lift up) a standard (as Jeremiah 4:6), to call the attention of those who might not be within hearing of the proclamation. The idols have been convicted of false pretensions; they are ashamed and dismayed (so we should render rather than confounded and broken in pieces) at the terrible result to their worshippers. Bel and Merodach are not different deifies, but merely different names of one of the two principal gods of the later Babylonian empire. Bel, it is true, was originally distinct from Merodach, but ultimately identified with him. Merodach was the tutelary god of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar seems to have been specially addicted to his worship, though, indeed, he mentions Nebo also with hardly less honour. This is the beginning of an inscription of this king's, preserved at the India House: - \"Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, glorious prince, worshipper of Marduk, adorer of the lofty one, glorifier of Nabu, the exalted, the possessor of intelligence\" (Mr. Rodwell's translation, 'Records of the Past,' 5:113). Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar speaks of Marduk as \"the god my maker,\" \"the chief of the gods,\" and of himself as \"his (Marduk's) eldest son, the chosen of his heart.\" Her images. It is a very peculiar word (gillulim), specially frequent in Ezekiel, and also found in a chapter of Leviticus with which Ezekiel has affinities (Leviticus 26:30). It evidently involves a sore disparagement of idol worship. The etymological meaning is \"things rolled,\" which may be variously interpreted as \"idol blocks\" (Gesenius), or \"doll images\" (Ewald).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Out of the north. There was a peculiar mystery attaching to the north in the Hebrew mind, as, in fact, the word very for \"north\" in Hebrew (literally, the hidden) indicates. The burnt offering was to be sacrificed on the north side of the altar (Leviticus 1:11), and the four cherubim, in the vision of Ezekiel, are described as coming from the north (Ezekiel 1:4). The horror with which Babylon was regarded was intensified, apparently, by its northern position (Jeremiah 1:14), and now the \"hidden\" north again pours forth its swarms of warriors against Babylon herself. They shall remove, they shall depart; rather, they are fled, they are gone; almost the same clause occurs in Jeremiah 9:10. The prediction is realized as past.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In those days, etc. The destruction of Babylon is immediately followed by the deliverance of Israel. But the description of the latter is a remarkable one. We are by no means to regard it as an idealized picture of the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, any more than we can suppose the glowing promises in the second part of Isaiah to have their sole fulfilment in that disappointing event. No; it is the characteristic of Messianic prophecy that, with \"foreshortened perspective,\" the prophets represent as equally near events which are really separated by ages. In the Book of Isaiah, for instance, preliminary judgments are repeatedly described in terms which, properly speaking, only apply to the great final judgment. In fact, each great political revolution is a stage in the Divine drama of judgment, which will reach its close in the final cataclysm. And so too here (as well as in Isaiah 40-46.) the promise of mercy to Israel, which began to be fulfilled in the edict of Cyrus, is represented as if the still future conversion of the people of Israel were actually accomplished. The description reminds us of Jeremiah 3:18-21. Notice the penitence of the returning exiles, and the reunion of Israel and Judah (see on Jeremiah 3:18). Going and weeping; they shall go; rather, they shall go, weeping as they go.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thitherward; rather, hitherward: The prophet is evidently writing from Jerusalem (comp. Jeremiah 51:50). Let us join ourselves. A conjectural emendation (nilveh for nilvu, a difficult reading, meaning, perhaps, \"join yourselves\"). A perpetual covenant. The same phrase occurs in Jeremiah 32:40. The addition, \"that shall not be forgotten,\" reminds us of \"the ark of the covenant,\" which was \"not to be remembered\" (Jeremiah 3:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Lost sheep. Not merely with reference to the scattering of the Captivity (as in Isaiah 27:13, where the Authorized Version has \"ready to perish\"), but to the transgressions of the Law of God, of which the Jews had been constantly guilty (comp. Psalm 119:176; Isaiah 53:6). Their shepherds... mountains. This is the marginal correction in the Hebrew Bible; the text has, \"Their shepherds have caused them to go astray upon the seducing mountains\" - a strange expression, which is, however, defended by Naegelsbach on the ground of Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:2, 23; Jeremiah 17:2. Their resting place; literally, their couching place; i.e. their pasture, Jehovah, at once their Pasture (ver. 7) and their true Shepherd (Psalm 23:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - We offend not; rather, we incur no guilt. As long as Israel lived a life consecrated to Jehovah, \"all that devoured him incurred guilt\" (Jeremiah 2:3). But now that he had wandered from Jehovah, and so forfeited his protection, his adversaries denied that they could be brought to account. Habitation of justice; strictly, pasture of righteousness. The same title is applied in Jeremiah 31:23 to Jerusalem. But Jerusalem's spiritual efficacy is only derivative; rest and life flow from Jehovah alone, who is, therefore, the true Pasture of his people. In the Hebrew, \"Jehovah\" is placed emphatically at the end of the verse. The hope of their fathers (comp. Psalm 22:4). To forsake Jehovah was an act of treason to the former generations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The prophet returns to the fate of Babylon. He exhorts the captive Israelites to flee in time, before the hostile army reaches the city (comp. Isaiah 48:20). Be as the he goats before the flocks; rather, as the rams, whose example is followed unhesitatingly by the flock. The \"flocks\" in this case are the strangers in Babylon (ver. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will raise; literally, I will stir up (or, awaken); comp. Jeremiah 6:22; Isaiah 13:17. An assembly of great nations. So in a parallel prophecy, \"the kingdoms of nations gathered together\" (Isaiah 13:4). Callias in Ebers' learned story, 'The Egyptian Princess,' speaks of \"an empire so casually heaped together, and consisting of seventy populations of different tongues and customs, as that of Persia.\" From thence; i.e. from the headquarters of the array of nations. As of a mighty expert man; rather, as of an expert warrior (or, mighty man). The marginal rendering of the Authorized Version represents a various reading of the Hebrew found in three old editions, and presupposed in the Targum and Vulgate, \"one making childless,\" i.e. \"a destroyer.\" The received reading, however, is self-evidently right. None shall return in vain. It seems doubtful whether this refers to the arrow or to the mighty man. The arrow may be said to \"return [or, 'turn'] in vain\" when it misses its aim or strikes the mark without piercing it (comp. 2 Samuel 1:22, where, however, it is the sword which is thus spoken of); the mighty man when he retires from the field defeated. This wider use of the phrase is sanctioned by Isaiah 55:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-20. - Babylon's desolation and Israel's glorification. Verses 11, 12. - Because ye were glad, etc.; rather, Truly ye may be glad; truly ye may rejoice, ye spoilers of mine heritage; truly ye may leap as a heifer at grass, and neigh as steeds; yet your mother, etc. Your triumph shall be of short duration; disgrace follows closely upon its heels. \"Your mother\" is a term for the nation regarded as a whole (comp. Isaiah 51:1; Hosea 2:2; Hosea 4:5). \"At grass\" is the reading adopted by the Septuagint and Vulgate; the pointed text has (the vowels alone are different), \"(a heifer) that thresheth,\" i.e. allowed to eat its fill of corn, agreeably to the direction in Deuteronomy 25:4. It is not clear why the Authorized Version deserted the received pointing. Behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness; rather, Behold, the hindermost of the nations! a wilderness, etc. The subject understood in the first part is obviously the people, in the second the land, of Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - All but the first clause of this verse is taken from Jeremiah 19:8; Jeremiah 49:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPut yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Put yourselves in array, etc. The Authorized Version, guided, perhaps, by considerations of rhythm, has misplaced the first stop, which ought to be after \"bow.\" The Medes are referred to in a parallel prophecy as great archers (Isaiah 13:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Shout against her; i.e. raise the battle cry (comp. Joshua 6:16; Isaiah 42:13). She hath given her hand. This action is generally mentioned as a pledge of friendship or a ratification of a promise (2 Kings 10:15; Ezekiel 17:18; Ezra 10:19); but the notion of surrender or submission would naturally follow (so in 1 Chronicles 29:24; 2 Chronicles 30:8). Dr. Payne Smith well quotes the words of Turnus, when begging his life of AEneas, \"Vicisti, et victum tendere palmas Ausonii videre\" ('AEneid,' 12:936). Her foundations. The word is difficult, but a comparison with the Syriac suggests the rendering, her walls. \"Foundations\" is obviously wrong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Cut off the sower, etc. \"Babylon\" here probably means Babylonia, for it is clear from ver. 12 that the curse belongs to the country as well as the city of Babylon; indeed, \"Babylon\" in ver. 13 seems to be used in the wider sense. Others think of the open spaces within the walls of Babylon, in which it is said that crops were raised to provision the city in case of a siege (see Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:518); but this is less natural. They shall turn, etc. The subject is, not the husbandmen, but the strangers in Babylonia; comp. the parallel passage, Isaiah 13:14, on which this passage is based. AEsehylus ('Pers.,' 53) speaks of the Πάμμικτος ὄχλος in Babylon. Whether brought by force from their homes, like the Jews, or voluntary residents for the sake of commerce, all should hurry from the doomed city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIsrael is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Israel is a scattered sheep, etc. Here a pause in the discourse occurs. The prophet returns to the present condition of Israel, who is likened to a sheep scared away from its fold by lions. The ruin wrought by the lions is described first as \"devouring\" and then as \"breaking the bones\" of Israel - in either case it is complete destruction, but the completeness is more emphasized by the second figure. In fact, when the \"ten tribes\" were carried captive, the elements of the theocracy still remained in the southern kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The flock restored. His habitation is an unfortunate rendering, which obscures the beautiful figure; read, his pasture (as in ver. 7). The places mentioned were all famous for their rich pasturage (comp. Jeremiah 22:6; Isaiah 33:9; Micah 7:14 (especially); Ezekiel 34:13, 14; Song of Solomon 4:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In those days, etc. An evangelical promise, reminding us of Jeremiah 31:34 and Jeremiah 33:8, and of the combination of spiritual with temporal blessings in the latter part of Isaiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-28. - The punishment of Babylon, corresponding to her crimes. Verse 21. - The land of Merathaim; i.e. of double rebellion. Probably enough an actual geographical name may lie at the root of this singular expression; but we are not able at present to say what it was. The prophet has, at any rate, modified it in such a way as to convey a definite meaning, symbolic of the character of Babylon (comp. on ver. 31). What was this meaning? According to Gesenius, there is an allusion to the two great blows inflicted on Israel and Judah by Assyria and Babylon respectively; but as these two powers were but the instruments of a higher Hand, this explanation would seem to be inconsistent with the prophetic teaching. Dahler, De Wette, and Keil take the two rebellions to be the spiritual ones of idolatry and pride; and there is no obvious objection to this. But the dual may be simply intended to express intensity; comp. ch. 17:18, \"Destroy them with double destruction\" (see note). The inhabitants of Pekod; i.e. of punishment. But here too a geographical name very probably lies underneath. The Taylor cylinder inscription of Sennacherib mentions a Pukudu ( = Pekod), together with Havrann (Hauran) and Nabatu (Nabathaeans); but this was the name of a tribe. In Ezekiel 23:23 we read, \"The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa,\" etc.; and in 'Records of the Past,' 11:92, we find a town Pikudu mentioned, lying to the south of Babylon, which may, perhaps, have given its name to a district, and to this district the prophet not improbably alludes. M. Halevy conjectures that the event which corresponds to the prophecy is the decisive battle which virtually terminated the Babylonian empire. According to the newly discovered Cyrus inscription, this battle was fought near a place called Rutu, which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Pukudu ('Records,' l.c.). About the symbolic meaning there can be no doubt: Pekod is a worthy pendant to Merathaim. Sin and punishment are so closely connected in the prophetic mind that one word sometimes covers both notions. It is doubtful, for instance, whether the better rendering of Isaiah 5:18 is \"draw sin as with a cart rope\" or \"draw punishment.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The hammer of the whole earth. So in Isaiah (Isaiah 14:5), \"Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the rulers; which smote peoples in passion with an unceasing stroke.\" In the next chapter a similar title is conferred upon Israel, with the right to retaliate upon Babylon all the evil which Babylon had done to Zion (Jeremiah 51:20-24). Compare the epithet Martel, \"The Hammer,\" given to Charles, Duke of the Franks, on account of his great victory over the Saraoens at Tours; it is tempting to add \"Makkabi,\" the epithet of Judas (Maccabaeus), but the k is not the same letter as that in maqqab, hammer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I have laid a snare for thee. It was very natural, as long as Cyrus's own account of the capture of Babylon was unknown, to refer for a fulfilment to the stratagem which, as Herodotus relates, that king employed, viz. diverting the waters of the Euphrates into an already existing reservoir, and entering the city unexpectedly by the river channel (Herod., 1:191). But the cylinder inscription, translated by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1880, shows that Babylon opened its gates of its own accord, on hearing the defeat and capture of Nabonidus. There is no occasion to look for any further fulfilment of the prophecy than the surprise which must ever come upon the bystander when he sees a mighty empire suddenly pass into the hands of its enemies. The tenses in this verse are not very happily rendered. It would be better to translate, I laid a snare for thee, and thou wast taken, O Babylon, unawares; thou wast found, etc., because thou hadst striven against the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Hath opened his armoury. A truly grand figure. The north country (the \"hidden\" part of the earth, as it was called in Hebrew) is regarded by the prophet as a storehouse of young and \"inexhaustible\" nations, from which Jehovah can at any time \"bring forth weapons of his indignation.\" The latter phrase, occurs again in the parallel prophecy (Isaiah 13:5), where it is evidently applied to the army of Medo-Persian invaders. For this is the work, etc.; rather, For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Come against her; rather, Come to her. Dr. Payne Smith infers that Babylon has already fallen, and that the persons addressed are not warriors only, but plunderers of every kind. This is almost too subtle. The prepositions \"to\" and \"against' (literally, upon) are so frequently interchanged (comp. Jeremiah 46:22; Jeremiah 49:9). From the utmost border; rather, all together; it is an idiom expressing universality. Those who are spoken of are regarded as a totality, \"from the utmost end\" of which its members come. Cast her up as heaps; rather, Cast it up as sheaves; i.e. ransack the repositories of Babylon's wealth, and heap it up like corn; last of all, destroy her (rather, it) utterly. The verb is a very emphatic one. Its primary meaning is \"to cut off, or shut off.\" Hence kherem, a devoted thing, is applied in the Law to that which is \"tabooed,\" as it were, cut off from any but sacred uses. In Leviticus 27:21 it is used of a field wholly appropriated to the sanctuary, and in 1 Samuel 15:21 and 1 Kings 20:42 to living beings doomed to destruction. Destruction is generally a part of the meaning; but it is not merely destruction, but an act of homage to the Divine justice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSlay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - In this verse we are told that the kherem, i.e. the Divine ban, falls upon the entire male population, as in the holy wars of Joshua (Joshua 6:21; Joshua 11:11, 20). All her bullocks. As in Jeremiah 51:40 and Isaiah 34:6, the doomed people is likened to sacrificial victims (comp. Jeremiah 46:10). The same fact is described without figure in Jeremiah 48:15. Go down to the slaughter; i.e. be forced down to the slaughtering trough.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The voice of them that flee, etc.; rather, Hark! those that flee, etc. A confused murmur indicates the approach of the fugitives with their great tidings. The vengeance of his temple; i.e. the punishment due to Babylon for burning the temple; comp. next verse, also ver. 15, \"The vengeance of the Lord,\" and Jeremiah 51:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCall together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-40. - The completeness of Babylon's destruction. Verse 29. - Call together the archers, etc. A dramatic way of indicating that the siege is about to begin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - With the exception of \"her\" in the second clause, a repetition of Jeremiah 49:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - O thou most proud; rather, O Pride! Just as in ver. 21 Babylon is called Merathaim, and as Egypt is, in Hebrew poetry, called Rahab, i.e. \"boisterousness\" or \"arrogance\" (Isaiah 30:7; Isaiah 51:9; Job 26:12; Psalm 87:4; Psalm 89:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The most proud; rather, Pride. Raise him up. For the sake of uniformity, \"her\" would be better; for it is Babylon who is spoken cf. There is an inconsistency in the use of the persons in the original. Elsewhere in this description Babylon is feminine; here it is masculine, to agree with \"Pride.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - At the end of ver. 32 a pause occurs in the discourse. Then the prophet takes up the theme again with renewed emphasis. Were oppressed; rather, are oppressed. Because the oppression of Israel and Judah still continues, whereas Israel has by this time been amply punished (\"received double,\" Isaiah 40:2) for her transgressions, Jehovah will himself interpose. He is, in fact, Israel's Goel (\"Redeemer\"), i.e. charged, like the next of kin, with the duty of recovering thy rights and avenging thy wrongs (comp. Isaiah 41:14; Isaiah 47:4). On the Goel, see Leviticus 25:25; Ruth 4:6; Numbers 30:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - That he may give rest to the land; rather, to the earth. Babylon was one of the great world empires; we can hardly dispense with this convenient Germanism. It was the wont of the Chaldeans, as Habakkuk puts it (Habakkuk 1:6), \"to walk through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that were not theirs.\" Observe the striking contrast - \"rest\" to the world which has been too long deprived of it, and \"disquiet\" to those who have hitherto spread it far and wide (comp. Isaiah 14:2, 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-38. - No human aid avails against so terrible a foe; therefore Jehovah calls upon his Sword (see on Jeremiah 47:6) to avenge the cause of his people. Verse 35. - A sword is, etc., should rather be, Sword upon the Chaldea, it is an exclamation equivalent to \"Let the Sword come upon the Chaldeans\" - that sword which never \"returns empty.\" The wise men are, partly the astronomers and astrologers at the various observatories in Babylonia, whose duty it was to send in monthly reports of the appearances in the sky, which were regarded as having an occult political significance (comp. Isaiah 47:13). In the next verse they are called liars, or praters. In Isaiah 44:25 this word stands parallel to \"diviners.\" Possibly \"liars\" may be a wider term than \"wise men,\" and includes an inferior grade of pretenders to \"wisdom.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The mingled people; rather, the foreign peoples. Even if in Jeremiah 25:20 the Hebrew 'erebh is an ethnographical term reminding us of the Assyrian Urbi used of Bedouin tribes, it is clear that no such explanation will suit here (see on Jeremiah 25:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - A drought. The Maasoretic critics, in their prosaic realism, were unable to see how a \"sword\" could be \"upon the waters;\" hence they altered khereb into khoreb. But the sword is merely a symbol of the Divine vengeance, and may be interpreted differently according to the exigencies of the context. Render, Sword upon the waters. They are mad upon their idols; rather, through Terrors they befool themselves. \"Terrors\" is a synonym for the gods of the heathen, which inspired a feeling of awe rather than affection, unlike Jehovah as he revealed himself through the authors of the psalms and prophecies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Parallel passages: Isaiah 34:14; Isaiah 13:20-22. The wild beasts of the desert; rather, wild cats (so Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' p. 862). Wild beasts of the islands; rather, jackals. Owls; rather, ostriches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - A verbal copy of Jeremiah 49:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41- Jeremiah 51:4. - The instruments of the judgment.

Thus vers. 41-43 are a repetition of JeremiahNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah50:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Jer.51":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me. The Hebrew has leb-kamai, which is Kasdim, or Chaldea, written in the cypher called Athbash (see on Jeremiah 25:26); just as Sheshach in ver. 41 is equivalent to Babel. The question arises whether the prophet himself is responsible for this covert way of writing, or a scribe in later times (so Ewald). In favour of the former view it may be urged that Babylon and Chaldea receive symbolic names (though not in Athbash) in the connected chapter (Jeremiah 50:21, 31, 32); in favour of the latter, that the Septuagint has Ξαλδαίους in ver. 1, and does not express Sheshach in ver. 41, also that the clause to which Sheshach belongs in Jeremiah 25:26 is of very dubious genuineness. A destroying wind; rather, the spirit (ruakh) of a destroyer (or perhaps, of destruction). The verb rendered in this verse \"raise up,\" when used in connection with ruakh, always means \"to excite the spirit of any one\" (ver. 11; Haggai 1:14; 1 Chronicles 5:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Farmers. This is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, according to the Massoretic pointing, however, we should render \"enemies.\" Possibly the prophet intended to suggest both meanings, a and o being so nearly related. Shall empty her land. The original has a much mere striking word, shall pour out (for the figures, comp. Jeremiah 48:12), which occurs again in similar contexts in Isaiah 24:1; Nahum 2:3 (Hebrew, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgainst him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Against him that bendeth, etc. There are two readings in the Hebrew Bible - one that given by the Authorized Version; the other, \"Against him that bendeth (let) him that bendeth his bow (come).\" The difficulty, however, is in the first two words of the clause, which are the same in either reading. It would be much simpler to alter a single point, and render, \"Let not the archer bend his bow; and let him not lift himself up in his coat of mail\" (for the old word \"brigandine,\" see on Jeremiah 46:4); which might be explained of the Babylonians, on the analogy of Jeremiah 46:6, \"Let him not bend his bow, for it will be useless;\" but then the second half of the verse hardly suits the first - the prohibitions seem clearly intended to run on in a connected order. On the other hand, the descriptions, \"him that bendeth,\" and \"him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine,\" seem hardly a natural way of putting \"the Chaldean army.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In her streets; i.e. in the streets of Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-14. - The covenant between Jehovah and Israel is one reason why Babylon must fall; and Babylon's own guilt is another. Hence pity is out of place.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Here liveth piety where pity ends;NEWLINECan any man be guilty more than heNEWLINEWhose bias with the doom of God contends?\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Dante, 'Inferno,' 20:28, Cayley.) Flee, therefore, lest ye be involved in Babylon's ruin. For Jehovah's purpose of vengeance cannot be reversed. Verse 5. - Hath not been forsaken. The Hebrew is much more forcible, \"is not widowed\" - alluding to the fundamental Old Testament idea of a mystic marriage between God and his people (comp. Isaiah 50:1; Isaiah 54:4-6; Hosea 2.). Was filled with sin; rather, with guilt (Hebrew, asham).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFlee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBabylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Babylon, as the instrument used by God for his judicial purposes, is likened to a wine cup, which \"made all the earth drunken\" (comp. Jeremiah 25:15, 16); and, more than this, to a golden cup, such was the impression made upon the Jewish prophets, by Babylon's unexampled splendour. (Golden cups were not unknown in Palestine; Jehu sent some to Shalmaneser; Smith, 'Assyrian Canon,' p. 114.) So, in Nebuchadnezzar's vision of the image, the head of the image is of gold (Daniel 2:32, 38). But neither her splendour nor her honourable position as God's minister could save her from merited destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBabylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Destroyed. The Hebrew, more forcibly, has \"is broken.\" The Authorized Version wished, perhaps, to avoid the objection that a golden cup could not, properly speaking, be broken. But if we once begin to harmonize the language of Hebrew poetry, we shall have no end. It is not the cup which falls, but the state, considered as a house (the \"breach\" of God's people is constantly referred to; e.g. Psalm 60:2; Isaiah 30:26). Howl for her. Sympathetic bystanders are dramatically appealed to. From the next verse it would seem that they are the various foreigners who, whether by choice or force, have been resident in Babylon, and who have acquired an interest in her fate. Hitzig thinks the foreign mercenaries (Jeremiah 50:37) or allies are specially referred to. Take balm for her pain (comp. Jeremiah 8:22; Jeremiah 46:11). The images of fracture and wound are combined, as in Isaiah 30:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - We would have healed Babylon. Experience shows that it is useless to attempt to correct such inveterate evils. Everyone into his own country (as Jeremiah 50:16). Her judgment; i.e. her punishment. Perhaps there is an allusion to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, burned by fire from heaven. But we might also render \"her crime\" (comp. Deuteronomy 19:6, where \"worthy of death\" is more strictly \"a capital crime\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Our righteousness; literally, our righteousnesses; not in the sense of \"righteous deeds \"(as in Isaiah 64:6; Judges 5:11), but \"those things which prove us to righteous; i.e. by punishing Babylon he hath justified us\" (Payne Smith).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Make bright; rather, polish, so that the arrows may penetrate easily (comp. Isaiah 49:2, \"a polished shaft\"). Gather the shields; rather, fill the shields (viz. with your arms); i.e. take hold of them. Comp. the phrase, \"to fill the hand with the bow\" (2 Kings 9:24). The rendering\" quivers\" is wanting in philological authority, and seems to have been inferred from this passage, where, however, it is unnecessary. The kings of the Medes. The prophet speaks of the Medes and not the Persians (comp. Isaiah 13:17). \"The reason, probably, is twofold:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the name Madai became known to the Jews at an earlier period than Paras, 'Persia;' andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes (e.g. Mazares and Harpagus, Herod., 1:157, 162)\" (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:275, 276). The new Cyrus inscription throws light on the latter circumstance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSet up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Upon the walls of Babylon; rather, toward the walls (as Jeremiah 4:6). The \"standard\" was carried before the army, to show the direction of the march. Make the watch strong. Not merely for the safety of the invaders, but to blockade the city. Comp. the phrase, \"Watchers [a synonymous Hebrew word is used] came from a far country\" (Jeremiah 4:16); i.e. besiegers. Prepare the ambushes. To press into the city when the besieged have made a sally (as Joshua 8:14-19; Judges 20:33, 37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Babylon is addressed as thou that dwellest upon many waters, with reference, not only to the Euphrates, but to the canals, dykes, and marshes which surrounded the city. The measure of thy covetousness. A strange expression, even when we have supplied (and have we a right to do so?) a suitable verb, such as \"is full.\" \"Measure\" is, literally, ell, \"covetousness\" should rather be gain, or spoil. Another possible rendering is, \"The ell measure of thy cutting off.\" In fact, the root meaning of the word rendered \"gain,\" or \"covetousness,\" is \"to cut off;\" and the figure of cutting off a man's half-finished life, like a web from the loom, is familiar to us from the psalm of Hezekiah (Isaiah 38:12; comp. Job 6:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Surely I will fill thee, etc. This is the rendering of Hitzig and Graf; the enemies are compared to locusts, as in Jeremiah 46:23. But the expression, \"to fill a city with men,\" is more naturally taken of the increase of the population of the city; and it is better to render, with Ewald and Keil, \"Even though [or, 'Surely even though'] I have filled thee with men, as with locusts, they shall raise over thee the cheer of the vintage;\" i.e. the millions of Babylon's population will not save her from the most utter ruin. For the vintage cheer, see on Jeremiah 25:30; and for the figures, see especially, Isaiah 63:1-6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-19. - Probably interpolated from Jeremiah 10:12-16 (the only verbal difference is in ver. 19, where \"Israel\" is left out before \"the rod of his inheritance\"). But may not Jeremiah have quoted himself? Conceivably, yes; but he would surely not have quoted such a passage here, where it spoils the context. For granting that a point of contact with ver. 14 may be found for vers. 15, 16 (Jehovah who has sworn has also the power to accomplish), yet the passage on the idols stands quite by itself, and distracts the attention of the reader.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-26. - Israel is now to be Jehovah's hammer, striking down everything, even the Chaldean colossus. But though Babylon may be as great and as destructive as a volcanic mountain, it shall soon be quite burnt out. Verse 20. - My battle axe; or, my mace. The mace (for a picture of which, see Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:459) was a weapon constantly employed by the Assyrians and presumably by the Babylonian kings. The battle axe was much less frequently used. But who is addressed by this terrible title? The commentators are divided, some inclining to Babylon,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because Babylon was the last person addressed (see ver. 14), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because a similar title was given to Babylon in Jeremiah 50:23: others to Israel, on the ground that the tenses are the same throughout the passage (vers. 20-24). The latter view is probably the best. How could Babylon be said to shatter her own \"governors\" and \"viceroys\" (for the prophet deliberately chooses the Babylonian official names)? The argument from the context is not very weighty; for it is clear that the connection of the parts of this prophecy is very loose. We may assume, then, that ver. 20 begins a fresh paragraph, standing quite apart from that which precedes. The objection of Graf and Keil, is that Israel could not himself be styled a \"mace,\" it being Israel's destiny to be delivered by others. But is not a very similar statement made of Israel in Isaiah 41:15; Psalm 149:7-9? (Kuenen offers a third explanation - Cyrus.) The nations... kingdoms. First the great social organisms are mentioned; next comes the military power; next the population, according to sex, age, and class.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Captains; rather, governors. It is the Hebraized form (pekhah) of the official name of an Assyrian or Babylonian governor (pahhat). Rulers; rather, viceroys; Hebrew, segamin (plural). The singular, sagan, is Hebraized from the Assyrian sakun, Babylonian sagun.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - Another image for the destruction of Babylon. Verse 25. - O destroying mountain. The description evidently points to a volcano.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Jehovah says that he will roll the mountain down from the rocks, which can only be understood of the stones and lava hurled down from the crater;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he will make it a \"mountain of burning,\" i.e. either to a burning, or, more forcibly, a burnt out mountain; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that, as a consequence of this, its stones shall be unsuitable for the purposes of the builder. Now, Palestine, it has been clearly made out, \"lies almost in the centre of one great volcano region of the earth's surface, that, namely, which includes the basin of the Mediterranean and the provinces of Western or Central Asia. Traces of that volcanic action are found in every direction. The black basaltic rock of the Hauran, the hot springs of Tiberius and Emmaus and Gadara, the naphtha fountains near the Dead Sea, the dykes of porphyry and other volcanic rooks that force their way through the limestone, the many eaves in the limestone rocks themselves, - all these show that we are treading on ground where the forces of the hidden fires of earth have been in times past in active operation. We are, that is, in a zone of earthquakes\" (Plumptre, 'Biblical Studies,' p. 136; comp. Pusey's note on Amos 4:11). There is a striking parallel to this prophetic description in Revelation 8:8, where the destruction of a great empire is likened to the submersion in the sea of a great burning mountain, (Vitringa has noticed the parallel.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And they shall not take of thee, etc. \"Of thee,\" i.e. \"of the Babylonian power\" personified - not \"of Babylon,\" which was built of brick, not of stone. The figure of the mountain is still preserved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSet ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-37. - A more detailed sketch of the conquest of Babylon; followed (somewhat out of the natural order) by a complaint on the part of Israel, and a promise of championship on that of Jehovah. Verse 27. - Prepare the nations; literally, consecrate the nations; viz. by religious rites. It is in an especial sense a religious war to which they are summoned (see on Jeremiah 6:4, and comp. Isaiah 13:3). Ararat. Ararat appears in the cuneiform inscriptions under the form \"Urartu? In Isaiah 37:38 the Authorized Version renders correctly by \"Armenia.\" The Assyrian kings, since Shalmaneser, were constantly at war with the Armenians; Assurbanipal reduced them to pay tribute. Minni. The Mannai of the cuneiform inscriptions. The locality of this tribe has been hitherto wrongly given as the mountain country about Lake Vau. But Professor Sayco has shown that they are rather to be looked for to the southwest of Lake Urumiyeh. A captain. The word (tifsar) is singular, but is probably to be understood collectively as equivalent to \"captains,\" like the word (sus, \"horse,\" equivalent to \"horses\") to which it is parallel. It is here used loosely of certain officials of the Armenians; but properly it is an Assyrian word (adopted from the Accadian or proto-Babylonian), meaning \"tablet writer,\" and derived, according to Friedrich Delitzsch, from dip or dup, a tablet, and sat, to write (Accadian words). As the rough caterpillars. This is the third of the four kinds of locusts mentioned in Joel 1:4; or, to speak more precisely, it is the locust in its penultimate stage, when its wings are already visible, but enveloped in horn-like sheaths, which stand up upon its back. Hence the epithet \"rough,\" or \"bristling.\" Keil's rendering, \"as the dreadful (horrifying) locust,\" implies a faulty interpretation of Joel 1:4. It would be strange indeed if Joel had accumulated four synonymous terms for locust in such a peculiar context.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPrepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The captains... the rulers; rather, the governors... the viceroys (as ver. 23). Thereof refers to the land of Medea; his dominion to the King of Medea, as the suzerain of the inferior chiefs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Shall tremble and sorrow. The Hebrew has \"trembled and sorrowed\" (or, \"quaked and writhed for pain\"); and in the sequel, have stood (i.e. been ratified by the event, as Jeremiah 44:28). The prophet here, as so often, regards what is still future as past from the point of view of eternity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Despair of the Babylonian warriors. Have forborne to fight should rather be have ceased to fight. In their holds. The word is used of hill or mountain fastnesses (comp. 1 Samuel 23:14, 19; Judges 6:2; 1 Chronicles 11:7), and such presumably are referred to here. Their might; rather, their courage. They have burned, etc. The subject is \"the enemies.\" Her bars; viz. those with which the city gates were secured (comp. Isaiah 45:2; Amos 1:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - One post shall run to meet another, etc. The wall being broken through at various points, couriers would meet each other on their way to the royal palace. This was itself a fortress in the centre of the city, on the Euphrates. The newly discovered cylinder inscription, however, shows that Nabonidus, the last King of Babylon, was not actually in the city at the time of the capture. At one end; rather, from end to end (see on Jeremiah 50:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And that the passages are stopped; rather, are seized (as Jeremiah 48:41). Babylon, it should be remembered, was divided nearly in half by the Euphrates. It was guarded, says Professor Rawlinson, \"by two walls of brick, which skirted them along their whole length. In each of these walls were twenty-five gates, corresponding to the number of the streets which gave upon the river; and outside each gate was a sloped landing place, by which you could descend to the water's edge, if you had occasion to cross the river. Boats were kept ready at these landing places to convey passengers from side to side; while for those who disliked this method of conveyance, a bridge was provided of a somewhat peculiar construction\" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514). The reeds they have burned with fire. This rendering is no doubt tenable, though it gives an unusual meaning to the first noun. The \"reeds\" would be those of the marshes in the neighbourhood of Babylon; and Kimchi suggests that these would be cut down to facilitate the entrance of the army into the city, Surely a very forced explanation. The natural meaning of the first noun is \"pools\" or \"lakes,\" and, considering that Herodotus (1:185) speaks of a lake in connection with the defences of Babylon, it has been thought (e.g. by Vitringa) that the prophet may refer to something which was to happen to this and similar lakes; \"burned with fire\" is then regarded as a hyperbolical expression equivalent to \"dried up\" (comp. ver. 36). This, however, is hardly less forced than the first interpretation; and we seem almost compelled to assume s corruption of the text, and to read (for 'agammin) 'armonim, palaces. If \"palaces\" (i.e. lofty houses, for such is the etymological meaning) were not uncommon at Jerusalem (Isaiah 32:14), much more frequent must they have been at Babylon, Or perhaps the prophet refers to the two magnificent royal palaces, which, together with the temple of Bel, constituted the wonders of Babylon. They were on opposite sides of the river, and were guarded with triple enclosures, the circumference in the one case amounting to sixty stadia (nearly seven miles), and in the other to thirty (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - It is time to thresh her; rather, at the time when it is trodden (i.e. made level by treading or trampling); comp. Isaiah 21:10; Micah 4:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The Jewish captives are introduced, describing the offences of Babylon. Hath devoured me; rather, hath devoured us, and so on. \"My delicates\" (delights), however, is correct. He hath made me; rather, he hath set us (down) as. Swallowed me up like a dragon; or, literally, like the dragon. Comparing this with ver. 44, it is difficult not to see an allusion to the Babylonian myth of the Serpent, who in the fight with Marduk (Meredach) devoured the tempest, which rent asunder her belly. The cuneiform text is given in Transactions of Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. 4. part 2, appendix plate 6. Part of it runs thus -NEWLINENEWLINE25. ip-te-ra pi-i-sa Ti-amtu a-na la-h-a-h-saNEWLINENEWLINEOpened also her mouth Tiamtu to swallow it.NEWLINENEWLINE26. rukhu limnu yus-te-ri-ba a-na la ca-par sap-ti-saNEWLINENEWLINEThe evil wind he caused to enter into the uncovering of her lips [ = into her lips before she could close them]NEWLINENEWLINE27. iz-zu-ti rukhi car-sa-sa i-tsa-mi-vaNEWLINENEWLINEviolent (were) the winds her belly filled; andNEWLINENEWLINE28. in-ni-kud lib-ba-sa va-pa-a-sa yus-pal-kiNEWLINENEWLINEshe was pierced in her heart and her mouth it caused to divide.NEWLINENEWLINEReaders of Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis' will remember Tiamtu the dragon, and the representations thereof given from the gems. In line 27 the word rendered \"her belly\" contains the Babylonian analogue of the word rendered in this verse \"his belly\" (k'res). With my delicates, he hath cast me out; rather,... cast us out; or, from my delights he hath cast as out. For the variation of person, comp. Judges 11:19, \"Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place;\" and on the whole phrase, Micah 2:9, \"...ye have cast out from their pleasant homes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And to my flesh; rather, and my (eaten)flesh (comp.

Inhabitant; rather, inhabitress; i.e. virgin inhabiting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Her sea; i.e. the Euphrates (comp. Isaiah 21:1), or perhaps the lake dug by Nitocris to receive the waters of the Euphrates, Herod., 1:185 (Payne Smith). Comp. on \"the reeds,\" ver. 32. Her springs, rather, her reservoirs. There are no springs, remarks Dr. Payne Smith, in the flat alluvial soil of Babylonia. The Hebrew word makor is used here collectively for the whole system of canals and reservoirs for the storing of the water.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Heaps. \"Vast 'heaps,' or mounds, shapeless and unsightly, are scattered at intervals over the entire region where it is certain that Babylon anciently stood\" (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:521). Dragons; rather, jackals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38-49. - Fall of Babylon; joy of the whole world. Verses 38, 39. - They shall roar .... In their heat; rather, They may roar... (yet) when they wax warm (with lust) I will prepare. The banquet which Jehovah will prepare is the \"cup of bewilderment\" spoken of in Psalm 60:3; comp. Isaiah 51:17 (i.e. a calamitous judgment).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - I will bring them down, etc. (comp.

The Septuagint omits \"Sheshach\" (see, on the name, Jeremiah 25:26), and very possibly rightly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - The sea is come up, etc. It is not clear whether this is to be taken literally or metaphorically (of the sea of nations, comp. ver. 55). Probably it is meant literally. It is said that the annual inundations of the Euphrates at present render many parts of the ruins of Babylon inaccessible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Bel; i.e. Merodach, the patron deity of Babylon (see on Jeremiah 50:2). Swallowed up. An allusion to the myth mentioned above (see ver. 34). That which Bel, i.e. Babylon, has \"swallowed up\" is not only the spoil of the conquered nations, but those nations themselves. Yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall; literally, is fallen (is as good as fallen). The famous wall of Babylon (comp. ver. 58) is described by Herodotus (1:179, 181). From this clause down to the first half of ver. 49 is omitted in the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - And lest your heart faint, etc.; rather, and (beware) lest, etc. A rumour shall both come; rather, for a rumour shall come. The war, then, will last some time, and all kinds of rumours will be in the air. Keil compares Matthew 24:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - From the north. The same statement as in Jeremiah 50:3, 9, 41.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - As Babylon hath caused, etc. The verse is very difficult. Ewald and others render thus: \"Not only must Babylon fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, but slain ones of the whole earth have fallen because of Babylon.\" But why this address to the slain ones of Israel? Besides, the antithesis indicated in the Hebrew is thereby destroyed. Hell explains the antithesis thus: \"Just as Babylon was intent on the fall of slain ones in Israel, so also there fall because of Babylonian slain ones of all the earth,\" viz. because there are to be found, in the capital of the empire, people from all quarters of the world, who are slain when Babylon is conquered. A better antithesis seems to be gained if we follow the Peshito, and read, at the end of the verse, \"in the whole earth.\" It will then be asserted by the prophet that, just as Babylon was the cause of the slaying of Israelites, so (as a punishment) the Babylonian fugitives shall be slain wherever they may wander.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 50-58. - Conclusion of the prophecy. Verse 50. - Ye that have escaped the sword. Evidently Jews are the persons addressed. It is not, however, perfectly clear whether the escape is from the sword of Babylon or from that of Divine vengeance. The parallel of Isaiah 24:14 would suggest the latter; but in the following verses the fall of Babylon is described as still to come. Stand not still. Lest ye be overtaken by the judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - We are confounded.

Are come; or, came.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - The height of her strength; i.e. her lofty walls and towers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - The great voice; rather, the loud sound; i.e. the tumult of the city. When her waves; rather, and her waves; i.e. the conquering hosts (comp. Jeremiah 46:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - The Lord God of recompenses shall, etc.; rather, The Lord is a God of recompense; he will, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - Her captains, and her rulers (see on ver. 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - The broad walls of Babylon... and her high gates. See Herod., 1:179, 181, and the parallel accounts from other authors, cited by Duncker ('Hist. of Antiquity,' 3:373, etc.), who taxes Herodotus with exaggeration, but admits as probable that the walls were not less than forty feet broad. Utterly broken; rather, destroyed even to the ground (literally, made bare). The people; rather, peoples.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 59-64. - Epilogue. The word, etc. (see ver. 61). Seraiah. Apparently the brother of Baruch. With Zedekiah. The Septuagint has \"from Zedekiah,\" which is referred by Bleek and Gratz. It would thus be an embassy, of which Seraiah was the head. According to the ordinary reading, Zedekiah went himself. A quiet prince. Not so. The Hebrew means probably, \"in command over the resting place,\" i.e. he took charge of the royal caravan, and arranged the halting places. But the Targum and the Septuagint have a more probable reading (not, however, one involving a change in the consonants of the text, \"in command over the gifts,\" i.e. the functionary who took charge of the presents made to the king. M. Lenormant speaks of an official called \"magister largitionum\" (bel tabti) in the Assyrian court ('Syllabaires Cundiformes,' par. 1877, p. 171).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah51:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 61. - (Comp. 50:3; 51:26.)

In fact, it was only after the return from Babylon that any popular schools were founded in Judaea, and not till shortly before the destruction of the temple that the elementary instruction attained the regularity of a system (Edersheim, 'Sketches of Jewish Social Life in the Time of Christ,' pp. 134, 135). The judgment of their God. A similar phrase occurs in Jeremiah 8:7. \"Judgment (mishpat) here (as in some other passages) has acquired a technical sense.

In Jeremiah 2:20 the word is rendered \"bands.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This verse reminds us of a famous passage in the first canto of Dante's 'Commedia,' in which Dante the pilgrim is successively opposed by three wild beasts - a panther, a lion, and a she-wolf. That the poet had Jeremiah in his mind cannot be doubted. The deep knowledge of the Scriptures possessed by medieval theologians (and such was Dante) may put many Protestants to shame. Curiously enough, whereas the early commentators on Dante interpret these wild beasts of vices, the moderns find historical references to nations. On the other hand, while modern expositors explain Jeremiah's wild beasts as symbols of calamities, Rashi and St. Jerome understand them of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks. A lion out of the forest. The first of a series of figures for the cruel invaders of Judah (comp. Jeremiah 4:7). The frequent references (see also Jeremiah 12:8; Jeremiah 25:38; Jeremiah 49:19; Jeremiah 50:4) show how common the lion was in the hills and valleys of the land of Israel. A wolf of the evenings; i.e. a wolf which goes out to seek for prey in the evening. So the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate (comp. \"wolves of the evening,\" Habakkuk 1:8; Zephaniah 3:3). But there is no evidence that 'erebh, evening, has for its plural 'arabhoth, which is, in fact, the regular plural of arabah, desert. Render, therefore, a wolf of the deserts, i.e. one which has its den in the deserts, and falls upon the cultivated parts when it is hungry. Luther, \"the wolf out of the desert.\" A leopard; rather, a panther. The Chaldeans are compared to this animal, on account of its swiftness, in Habakkuk 1:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - How... for this? rather, Why should I pardon thee? Thy children; i.e. (since \"the daughter of Zion\" is equivalent to Zion regarded as an ideal entity) the members of the Jewish people (comp. Leviticus 19:18, \"the children of thy people\"). When I had fed them to the full. So Ewald, following the versions and many manuscripts (there is no marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible). This gives a good sense, and may be supported by ver. 28; Deuteronomy 32:15; Hosea 13:6. But the reading of the received Hebrew text, though somewhat more difficult, is yet perfectly capable of explanation; and, slight as the difference is in the reading adopted by Ewald (it involves a mere shade of pronunciation), it is not to be preferred to the received reading. Read, therefore, though -r made them to swear (allegiance),!let they committed adultery. The oath may be that of Sinai (Exodus 24.), or such au oath as had been recently taken by Josiah and the people (1 Kings 23:3; 2 Chronicles 34:31, 32). The \"adultery\" may be taken both in a literal and in a figurative sense, and so also the \"harlots' houses\" in the next clause. It is also well worthy of consideration whether the prophet may not be referring to certain matrimonial customs handed down from remote antiquity and arising from the ancient system of kinship through women (comp. Ezekiel 22:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - As fed horses in the morning. The rendering fed horses has considerable authority. \"Lustful horses\" is also possible; this represents the reading of the Hebrew margin. The following word in the Hebrew is extremely difficult. \"In the morning\" cannot be right, as it is against grammar; but it is not easy to furnish a substitute. Most moderns render \"roving about;\" Furst prefers \"stallions.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD'S.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-18. - Provoked by the open unbelief of the men of Judah, Jehovah repeats his warning of a sore judgment. Verse 10. - Her walls. There is a doubt about \"walls,\" which should, as some think, rather be vine-rows (a change of points is involved; also of shin into sin - the slightest of all changes), or shoots, or branches (comparing the Syriac). The figure would thus gain somewhat in symmetry. However, all the ancient interpreters (whose authority, overrated by some, still counts for something) explain the word as in the Authorized Version, and, as Graf remarks, in order to destroy the vines, it' would be necessary to climb up upon the walls of the vineyard. (For the figure of the vine or the vineyard, scrap, on Jeremiah 2:21.) Take away... not the Lord's. The Septuagint and Peshito read differently, translating \"leave her foundations, for they are the Lord's\" (supposing the figure be taken from a building). As the text stands, it is better to change battlements into tendrils. Judah's degenerate members are to be removed, but the vine-stock, i.e., the behooving kernel of the nation, is to be left. It is the key-note of the \"remnant\" which Jeremiah again strikes (see Jeremiah 4:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - It is not he. Understand \"who speaks by the prophets\" (Payne Smith). It is hardly conceivable that any of the Jews absolutely denied the existence of Jehovah. They were practical, not speculative unbelievers, like men of the world in general.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And the prophets, etc. A continuation of the speech of the unbelieving Jews. The word is not in them. The Authorized Version gives a good meaning, but it involves an interference with the points. The pointed text must be rendered, he who speaketh (through the prophets, viz. Jehovah) is not in them. Thus the Jews hurl against prophets like Jeremiah the very charge which Jeremiah himself brings against the \"false prophets\" in Jeremiah 23:25-32. Thus shall it be done; rather, so be it done; i.e. may the sword and famine, with which they threaten us, fall upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - My words in thy mouth fire. (See on Jeremiah 1:9, 10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - O house of Israel. After the captivity of the ten tribes, Judah became the sole representative of the people of Israel (scrap. Jeremiah 2:26). A mighty nation. The Authorized Version certainly gives apart of the meaning. The Hebrew word rendered \"mighty\" ('ethan), rather, \"perennial,\" is the epithet of rocks and mountains (Numbers 24:21; Micah 6:2); of a pasture (Jeremiah 49:19); of rivers (Deuteronomy 21:4; Psalm 74:15). As applied in the present instance, it seems to describe the inexhaustible resources of a young nation. Render here, ever replenished; i.e. ever drawing anew from its central fountain of strength. Does not this aptly convey the impression which a long-civilized nation (and the Jews, who have been called \"rude,\" were only so by comparison with the Egyptians and Assyrians) must derive from the tumultuous incursions of nomad hosts? The description-will therefore fit the Scythians; but it is not inappropriate to the Chaldeans, if we take into account the composite nature of their armies. An ancient nation; i.e. one which still occupies its primeval seat in the north (Jeremiah 6:22), undisturbed by invaders. Whose language thou knowest not. So Isaiah of the Assyrians, \"(a people) of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.\" The Jews were no philologists, and were as unlikely to notice the fundamental affinity of Hebrew and Assyrian as an ancient Greek to observe the connection between his own language and the Persian. When the combatants were to each other βάρβαροι, mercy could hardly be expected. The sequence of vers. 49 and 50 in Deuteronomy 28. speaks volumes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Their quiver. (See on Jeremiah 4:29.) As an open sepulcher; i.e. furnished with deadly arrows, \"fiery darts.\" So the psalmist, of the \"throat\" of deceitful persecutors (Psalm 5:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Which thy sons and thy daughters, etc.; rather, they shall eat that sons and thy daughters. In the other clauses of the verse the verb is in the singular, the subject being the hostile nation. They shall impoverish, etc.; rather, it shall batter... with weapons of war (so rightly Payne Smith); kherebh, commonly rendered \"sword.\" is applied to any cutting instrument, such as a razor (Ezekiel 5:1), a mason's tool (Exodus 20:25), and, as here and Ezekiel 26:9, weapons of war in general.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-29. - Judah's own obstinacy and flagrant disobedience are the causes of this sore judgment. Verse 19. - Like as ye have forsaken me, etc. The law of correspondence between sin and punishment pervades Old Testament prophecy (comp. Isaiah 5.). As the Jews served foreign gods in Jehovah's land, they shall become the slaves of foreigners in a land which is not theirs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeclare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Without understanding; literally, without heart. This seems at first sight inconsistent with ver. 23, where the people is described as having indeed a \"heart,\" but one hostile to Jehovah. The explanation is that a course of deliberate sin perverts a man's moral perceptions. The prophet first of all states the result, and then the cause. So in Ezekiel 12:2, \"Which have eyes and see not,\" etc.; \"for they are a rebellions house.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Fear ye not me? The Hebrew places \"me\" emphatically at the beginning of the sentence. By a perpetual decree. This is one of the evidences, few but sufficient, of the recognition of natural laws by the Biblical writers; of laws, however, which are but the description of the Divine mode of working, \"covenants\" (Jeremiah 33:20; comp. Genesis 9:18) made for man's good, but capable of being annulled (Isaiah 54:10). Comp. Proverbs 8:29; Job 38:8-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A revolting and a rebellious heart. The heart is the center of the moral life virtually equivalent to \"the will;\" it. is \"revolting\" when it \"turns back\" (so literally here) from God's Law and service, and \"rebellious\" when it actively defies and opposes him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - That giveth rain, etc. The second appeal is to the regularity of the rains. Dr. Robinson remarks that there are not at the present day in Palestine \"any particular periods of rain, or succession of showers, which might be regarded as distinct rainy seasons,\" and that...unless there has been some change m the climate of Palestine, the former and the latter rains seem to correspond to \"the first showers of autumn, which revived the parched and thirsty earth and prepared it for the seed, and the later showers of spring, which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the fields\" ('Biblical Researches,' 3:98). He reserveth unto us, etc.; literally, he keepeth for us the weeks - the statutes of harvest; i.e. the weeks which are the appointed conditions of harvest. The prophet means the seven weeks which elapsed from the second day of the Passover to the \"Feast of Harvest,\" or \"Feast of Weeks\" (Pentecost) (Exodus 23:16; Exodus 34:22; Deuteronomy 16:9, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Have turned away these things. \"These things\" are the benefits mentioned in the preceding verse (comp. Jeremiah 3:3; Jeremiah 12:4). Thus the judgment is not entirely future; a foretaste of it has already been given (comp. 1 Kings 17; Amos 4.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They lay wait, etc.; rather, they spy (literally, one spieth), as fowlers lie in wait. A trap; literally, a destroyer; i.e. an instrument of destruction (comp. Isaiah 54:16, where\" the waster\" (or destroyer) probably means the weapon referred to previously).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - A cage. The Hebrew word klub is used in Amos 8:1 for a basket such as was used for fruit; it seems to be the parent of the Greek word κλωβός, used in the 'Anthology' for a bird-cage. The root means to plait or braid; hence some sort of basket-work seems to be meant. Connecting this with the preceding verse, Hitzig seems right in inferring that the \"cage\" was at the same time a trap (comp. Ecclus. 11:30, \"Like as a partridge taken in a cage ἐν καρτάλλῳ, a peculiar kind of basket], so is the heart of the proud\"). Canon Tristram suggests that there is an allusion to decoy-birds, which are still much employed in Syria, and are carefully trained for their office ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 163), But this seems to go beyond the text. Deceit; i.e. the goods obtained by deceit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - They overpass the deeds of the wicked; rather, they overpass the common measure of wickedness (literally, the cases of wickedness); or, as others, they exceed in deeds of wickedness. Yet they prosper; rather, so that they (the fatherless) might prosper; or, that they (the rich) might make it to prosper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - A repetition of ver. 9 in the manner of a refrain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - The result of the prophet's examination of the moral condition of the people. Verse 30. - A wonderful and horrible thing, etc.; rather, an appalling and horrible thins hath happened in the land. The word rendered \"appalling\" (or stupefying) has a peculiar force, it only occurs again in Jeremiah 23:14, though a cognate adjective is found in Jeremiah 18:13 (comp. on Jeremiah 2:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah5:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The prophets... the priests. (See on Jeremiah 2:26.) Bear rule by their means; rather, rule at their beck. (literally, at their hands, comp. Jeremiah 33:13; 1 Chronicles 25:2, 3; 2 Chronicles 23:18). An example of this interference of the false prophets with the priestly office is given by Jeremiah himself. (Jeremiah 29:24-26). My people love to have it so. Sometimes the prophets speak as if the governing classes alone were responsible for the sins and consequent calamities of their country. But Jeremiah here expressly declares that the governed were as much to blame as their governors.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - Arrival of a hostile army from the north, and summons to flee from the doomed city. Verse 1. - O ye children of Benjamin. The political rank of Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, makes it difficult to realize that Jerusalem was not locally a city of Judah at all. It belonged, strictly speaking, to the tribe of Benjamin, a tribe whose insignificance, in comparison with Judah, seems to have led to the adoption of a form of expression not literally accurate (see Psalm 128:68). The true state of the case is evident from an examination of the two parallel passages, Joshua 15:7, 8, and Joshua 18:16, 17. As Mr. Fergusson points out, \"The boundary between Judah and Benjamin... ran at the foot of the hill on which the city stands, so that the city itself was actually in Benjamin, while, by crossing the narrow ravine of Hinnom, you set foot on the territory of Judah\" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:983). It is merely a specimen of the unnatural method of early harmonists when Jewish writers tell us that the altars and the sanctuary were in Benjamin, and the courts of the temple in Judah. The words of \"the blessing of Moses\" are clear (Deuteronomy 33:12): \"The beloved of the Lord! he shall dwell in safety by him, sheltering him continually, and between his shoulders he dwelleth;\" i.e. Benjamin is specially protected, the sanctuary being on Benjamite soil. And yet these highly favored \"children of Benjamin\" are divinely warned to flee from their sacred homes (see Jeremiah 7:4-7). Gather yourselves to flee; more strictly, save your goods by flight. In Jeremiah 4:6 the same advice was given to the inhabitants of the country districts. There, Jerusalem was represented as the only safe refuge; here, the capital being no longer tenable, the wild pasture-land to the south (the foe being expected from the north) becomes the goal of the fugitives of Jerusalem. In Tokoa. Tokoa was a town in the wild hill-county to the south of Judah, the birthplace of the prophet Amos. It is partly mentioned because its name seems to connect it with the verb rendered blow the trumpet. Such paronomasiae are favorite oratorical instruments of the prophets, and especially in connections like the present (comp. Isaiah 10:30; Micah 1:10-15). A sign of fire in Beth-hakkerem; rather, a signal on Beth-hakkerem. The rendering of Authorized Version was suggested by Judges 20:38, 40; but there is nothing in the present context (as there is in that passage) to favor the view that a fiery beacon is intended. Beth-hakkerem lay, according to St. Jerome, on an eminence between Jerusalem and Tekoa; i.e. probably the hill known as the Frank Mountain, the Arabic name of which (Djebel el-Furaidis, Little Paradise Mountain) is a not unsuitable equivalent for the Hebrew (Vineyard-house). The \"district of Beth-hakkerem\" is mentioned in Nehemiah 3:14. The choice of the locality for the signal was a perfect one. \"There is no other tell,\" remarks Dr. Thomson, \"of equal height and size in Palestine.\" Appeareth; rather, bendeth forward, as if it were ready to fall.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I have likened... a comely and delicate woman. This passage is one of the most difficult in the book, and if there is corruption of the text anywhere, it is here. The most generally adopted rendering is, \"The comely and delicate one will I destroy, even the daughter of Zion,\" giving the verb the same sense as in Hosea 4:5 (literally it is, I have brought to silence, or perfect of prophetic certitude). The context, however, seems to favor the rendering \"pasturage\" (including the idea of a nomad settlement), instead of \"comely;\" but how to make this fit in with the remainder of the existing text is far from clear. The true and original reading probably only survives in fragments. Ver. 3 - The shepherds with their flocks, etc.; rather, To her came shepherds with their flocks; they have pitched their tents round about her; they have pastured each at his side. The best commentary on the last clause is furnished by Numbers 22:4, \"Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPrepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Prepare ye war; literally, sanctify (or, consecrate) war. The foes are dramatically described as urging each other on at the different stages of the campaign. The war is to be opened with sacrifices (comp. Isaiah 13:3 with 1 Samuel 13:9); next there is a forced march, so as to take the city by storm, when the vigilance of its defenders is relaxed in the fierce noontide heat (comp. Jeremiah 15:8); evening surprises the foe still on the way, but they press steadily on, to do their work of destruction by night. The rapidity of the marches of the Chaldeans impressed another prophet of the reign of Josiah - Habakkuk (see Habakkuk 1:6, 8). Woe unto us! for the day goeth away; rather, Alas for us! for the day hath turned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Let us go; rather, let us go up. \"To go up\" is the technical term for the movements of armies, whether advancing (as here and Isaiah 7:1) or retreating (as Jeremiah 21:2; Jeremiah 34:21; Jeremiah 37:5, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Hew ye down trees; rather, her trees. Hewing down trees was an ordinary feature of Assyrian and Babylonian expeditions. Thus, Assurnacirpal \"caused the forests of all (his enemies) to fall\" ('Records of the Past,' 3:40, 77), and Shalmaneser calls himself \"the trampler on the heads of mountains and all forests \"(Ibid. p. 83; comp. p. 90). The timber was partly required for their palaces and fleets, but also, as the context here suggests, for warlike operations. \"Trees,\" as Professor Rawlinson remarks, \"were sometimes cut down and built into the mound\" (see next note); they would also be used for the \"bulwarks\" or siege instruments spoken of in Deuteronomy 20:20. Cast a mount; literally, pour a mount (or \"bank,\" as it is elsewhere rendered), with reference to the emptying of the baskets of earth required for building up the \"mount\" (mound). Habakkuk (Habakkuk 1:10) says of the Chaldeans, \"He laugheth at every stronghold, and heapeth up earth, and taketh it\" (comp, also 2 Samuel 20:15; Isaiah 37:33). The intention of the mound was not so much to bring the besiegers on a level with the top of the walls as to enable them to work the battering-rams to better advantage (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:472). She is wholly oppression, etc.; rather, she is the city that is punished; wholly oppression is in the midst of her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - As a fountain casteth out; rather, as a cistern keepeth fresh (literally, cool). The wickedness of Jerusalem is so thoroughly ingrained that it seems to pass into act by a law of nature, just as a cistern cannot help always yielding a supply of cool, fresh water. Violence and spoil; rather, injustice and violence (so Jeremiah 20:8; Amos 3:10; Habakkuk 1:3). Before me, etc.; rather, before my face continually is sickness and wounding. The ear is constantly dinned with the sounds of oppression, and the eye pained with the sight of the bodily sufferings of the victims. The word for\" sickness\" is applicable to any kind of infirmity (see Isaiah 53:3, 4), but the context clearly limits it here to bodily trouble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Be thou instructed; rather, Let thyself be corrected (Authorized Version misses the sense, a very important one, of the conjugation, which is Nifal tolerativum (comp. Psalm 2:10; Isaiah 53:12). The phrase equivalent to \"receive correction\" (Jeremiah 2:30; Jeremiah 5:3), and means to accept the warning conveyed in the Divine chastisement. Lest my soul, etc.; rather, lest my soul be rent from thee (Authorized Version renders the same verb in Ezekiel 23:17, \"be alienated\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-15. - It is an all but complete Judgment, which Jehovah foreshows. Unwilling as the people are to hear it, the disclosure must be made. Verse 9. - They shall thoroughly glean, etc. \"Israel\" has already been reduced to a \"remnant;\" the ten tribes have lost their independence, and Judah alone remains (Jeremiah 5:15). Even Judah shall undergo a severe sifting process, which is likened to a gleaning (comp. Isaiah 24:13; Obadiah 1:5; Jeremiah 49:9). The prospect is dark, but believers in God's promises would remember that a few grapes were always left after the gathering (comp. Isaiah 17:6). Turn back thine hand. If the text is correct, the speaker here addresses the leader of the gleaners. Keil thinks this change of construction is to emphasize the certainty of the predicted destruction. But it is much more natural (and in perfect harmony with many other similar phenomena of the received text) to suppose, with Hitzig, that the letter represented in the Authorized Version By \"thine\" has arisen by a mistaken repetition of the first letter of the following word, and (the verbal form being the same for the infinitive and the imperative) to render turning again the hand. In this case the clause will be dependent on the preceding statement as to the \"gleaning\" of Judah. Into the baskets; rather, unto the shoots. The gleaners will do their work with a stern thoroughness, laying the hand of destruction again and again upon the vine-shoots.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Their ear is uncircumcised; covered as it were with a foreskin, which prevents the prophetic message from finding admittance. Elsewhere it is the heart (Leviticus 26:41; Ezekiel 44:7), or the lips (Exodus 6:12) which are said to be \"circumcised;\" a passage in Stephen's speech applies the epithet both to the heart and to the ears (Acts 7:51).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Therefore I am full; rather, But I am full. I will pour it out. The text has \"pour it out.\" The sudden transition to the imperative is certainly harsh, and excuses the conjectural emendation which underlies the rendering of the Authorized Version. If we retain the imperative, we must explain it with reference to Jeremiah's inner experience. There are, we must remember, two selves in the prophet (comp. Isaiah 21:6), and the higher prophetic self here addresses the lower or human self, and calls upon it no longer to withhold the divinely communicated burden. All classes, as the sequel announces, are to share in the dread calamity. Upon the children abroad; literally, upon the child in the street (comp. Zechariah 8:5). The assembly of young men. It is a social assembly which is meant (comp. Jeremiah 15:17, \"the assembly of the laughers\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Shall be turned; i.e. transferred. Their fields and wives. Wives are regarded as a property, as in Exodus 20:17 (comp. Deuteronomy 5:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Given to covetousness; literally, gaineth gain; but the word here rendered \"gain\" implies that it is unrighteous gain (the root means \"to tear\"), Unjust gain and murder are repeatedly singled out in the Old Testament as representative sins (comp. Ezekiel 33:31; Psalm 119:36; Isaiah 1:15; Jeremiah 2:34; and see my note on Isaiah 57:17). There is a special reason for the selection of \"covetousness\" here. Land was the object of a high-born Jew's ambition, and expulsion from his land was his appropriate punishment (comp. Isaiah 5:8, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They have healed, etc. The full force of the verb is, \"they have busied themselves about healing\" (so Jeremiah 8:11; Jeremiah 51:9). Of the daughter. Our translators evidently had before them a text which omitted these words, in accordance with many Hebrew manuscripts and the Septuagint; Van der Hooght's text, however, contains them, as also does the parallel passage (Jeremiah 8:11). Slightly; or, lightly; Septuagint, ἐξουθενοῦντες. Saying, Peace, peace. Always the burden of the mere professional prophets, who, as one of a higher order - the bold, uncompromising Micah - fittingly characterizes them,\" bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace;\" i.e. draw flattering pictures of the state and prospects of their country, in order to \"line their own pockets\" (Micah 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Were they ashamed? The Authorized Version certainly meets the requirements of the context; there seems to be an implied interrogation. Most, however, render, \"They are brought to shame;\" in which ease it seems best to take the verb as a perfect of prophetic certitude, equivalent to \"they shall surely be brought to shame.\" When; rather, because. Nay, they were not at all ashamed; rather, nevertheless they feel no shame (i.e. at present). They shall be cast down; rather, they shall stumble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-21. - Without hearty repentance, there is no hope of escape. But hitherto Judah has rejected all admonitions. What availeth mere ceremonial punctuality? Verse 16. - Stand ye in the ways; literally, station yourselves on (or, by) roads, i.e. at the meeting-point of different roads. There (as the following words state) the Jews are to make inquiry as to the old paths. Antiquity gives a presumption of rightness; the ancients were nearer to the days when God spoke with man; they had the guidance of God's two mighty \"shepherds\" (Isaiah 63:11); they knew, far better than we, who \"are but of yesterday, and know nothing\" (Job 8:9), the way of happiness. For though there are many pretended \"ways,\" there is but \"one way\" (Jeremiah 32:39) which has Jehovah's blessing (Psalm 25:8, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Also I set; rather, and I kept raising up (the frequentative perfect). Watchmen; i.e. prophets (Ezekiel 3:17, and part of Isaiah 52:8; Isaiah 56:10). Hearken, etc. probably the words of Jehovah. Standing on their high watch-tower (Habakkuk 2:1), the prophets scrutinize the horizon for the first appearance of danger, and give warning of it by (metaphorically) blowing a trumpet (so Amos 3:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Therefore hear, etc. Remonstrance being useless, the sentence upon Israel can no longer be delayed, and Jehovah summons the nations of the earth as witnesses (comp. Micah 1:2; Isaiah 18:3; Psalm 49:1). O congregation, what is among them. The passage is obscure. \"Congregation\" can only refer to the foreign nations mentioned in the first clause; for Israel could not be called upon to hear the judgment \"upon this people\" (ver. 19). There is, however, no other passage in which the word has this reference. The words rendered \"what is among them,\" or \"what (shall happen) in them,\" seem unnaturally laconic, and not as weighty as one would expect after the solemn introduction. If correct, they must of course refer to the Israelites. But Graf's conjecture that the text is corrupt lies near at hand. The least alteration which will remove the difficulties of the passage is that presupposed by the rendering of Aquila (not Symmachus, as St. Jerome says; see Field's 'Hexapla') and J. D. Michaelis, \"the testimony which is against them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The fruit of their thoughts. That punishment is the ripe fruit of sin, is the doctrine of the Old (Isaiah 3:10; Psalm 58:11, margin) as well as of the New Testament (James 1:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - To what purpose... incense from Sheba? This is the answer to an implied objection on the part of the Jews, that they have faithfully fulfilled their core-menial obligations. \"To obey is better than sacrifice\" (1 Samuel 15:22); \"And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" (Micah 6:8; comp. Isaiah 1:11; Amos 5:21-24; Hosea 6:6; Micah 6:6-8). All these passages must be read in the light of the prophets' circumstances. A purely formal, petrified religion compelled them to attack the existing priesthood, and a holy indignation cannot stop to measure its language. Incense from Sheba; frankincense from south-west Arabia. This was required for the holy incense (Exodus 30:34), and as an addition to the minkhah, or \"meal offering.\" Sweet cane. The \"sweet calamus\" of Exodus 30:23, which was imported from India. It was an ingredient in the holy anointing oil (Exodus, loc. cit.). Not to be confounded with the sugar-cane.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I will lay stumbling-blocks, etc, Of the regenerate Israel of the future it is prophesied (Isaiah 54:15) that his enemies shall \"fall upon him [or, 'by reason of him'].\" Of the unregenerate Israel of the present, that he shall \"fall\" (i.e. come to ruin) upon the \"stumbling-blocks\" presented, not without God's appointment, by the terrible northern invader.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-30. - The enemy described; the terror consequent on his arrival; a rumored declaration of the moral cause of the judgment. Verse 22. - From the north country (so Jeremiah 1:14 (see note); 4:6). Shall be raised; rather, shall be aroused. The sides of the earth; rather, \"the recesses (i.e. furthest parts) of the earth\" (so Jeremiah 35:32; Isaiah 14:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Spear; rather, javelin (or, lance). They are cruel. The cruelty of the Assyrians and Babylonians seems to have spread general dismay. Nahum calls Nineveh \"the city of bloodshed\" (Nahum 3:1); Habakkuk styles the Chaldeans \"bitter and vehement, terrible and dreadful\" (Habakkuk 1:6, 7). The customs brought out into view m the monuments justify this most amply, though Professor Rawlinson thinks we cannot call the Assyrians (with whom the Babylonians may of course be coupled) naturally hard. hearted. \"The Assyrian listens to the enemy who asks for quarter; he prefers making prisoners go slaying.; he is very terrible in the battle and the assault, but afterwards he forgives and spares\" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 1:243). Their voice roareth. The horrid roar of the advancing hosts seems to have greatly struck the Jews (comp. Isaiah 5:30; Isaiah 17:12, 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - We have heard the fame thereof. The prophet identifies himself (comp., for the same phenomenon, Jeremiah 4:19-21; Jeremiah 10:19, 20) with his people, and expresses the general feeling of anxiety and pain. The phraseology of the closing lines reminds us of Isaiah 13:7, 8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Go not forth into the field. The \"daughter of Zion\" (i.e. the personific population of Jerusalem) is cautioned against venturing outside the walls. The sword of the enemy; rather, the enemy hath a sword. Fear is on every side; Hebrew, magor missa-bib; one of Jeremiah's favorite expressions (see Jeremiah 20:3, 10; Jeremiah 46:5; Jeremiah 49:29; and comp. Psalm 31:13 [14].). Naturally of a timid, retiring character, the prophet cannot help feeling the anxious and alarming situation into which at the Divine command he has ventured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Wallow thyself in ashes; rather, sprinkle thyself with ashes, a sign of mourning (2 Samuel 13:19; so Micah 1:10). Mourning, as for an only son. The Septuagint renders πένθος ἀγαπητοῦ (comp. Genesis 22:2, where in like manner the Septuagint renders, not \"thine only son,\" but \"thy beloved son\"). Possibly this was to avoid a supposition which might have occurred to some readers (it has, in fact, occurred to several modern critics) that the \"only son\" was Adonis, who was certainly \"mourned for\" by some of the Israelites under the name of Thammuz (Ezekiel 8:14), and whose Phoenician name is given by Philo of Byblus as Ἰεούδ (i.e. probably Yakhidh, only begotten, the word used by Jeremiah; comp. Βηρούθ, equivalent to Berith). M. Renan found a vestige of the ancient festival of Adonis at Djebeil (the Phoenician Gebal) even at the present day. There would be nothing singular in the adoption of a common popular phrase by the prophet, in spite of its reference to a heathen custom (comp. Job 3:8), and the view in question gives additional force to the passage. But the ordinary explanation is perfectly tenable and more obvious. The phrase, \"mourning [or, 'lamentation'] for an only begotten one,\" occurs again in Amos 8:10; Zechariah 12:10. In the last-mentioned passage it is parallel with \"bitter weeping for a firstborn.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I have set thee, etc.; literally, as an assayer have I set thee among my people, a fortress. Various attempts have been made to avoid giving the last word its natural rendering, \"a fortress.\" Ewald, for instance, would alter the points, and render \"a separator [of metals],\" thus making the word synonymous with that translated \"an assayer;\" but this is against Hebrew usage. Hitzig, assuming a doubtful interpretation of Job 22:24, renders \"... among my people without gold,\" i.e. \"without there being any gold there for thee to essay\" (a very awkward form of expression). These are the two most plausible views, and yet neither of them is satisfactory. Nothing remains but the very simple conjecture, supported by not a few similar phenomena, that mibhcar, a fortress, has been inserted by mistake from the margin, where an early glossator had written the word, to remind of the parallel passage (Jeremiah 1:18, \"I have made thee this day a fortress-city,\" 'it mibhcar). In this and the following verses metallurgic phraseology is employed with a moral application (comp. Isaiah 1:22, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Grievous revolters; literally, rebels of rebels. Walking; rather, going about, as a peddler with his wares (so Proverbs 11:13; Proverbs 20:19; Leviticus 19:16). Jeremiah had good reason to specify this characteristic of his enemies (see Jeremiah 18:18). Brass and Iron; rather, copper and iron, in short, base metal,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The bellows are burned. The objection to this rendering is that the burning of the bellows would involve the interruption of the process of assaying. We might, indeed, translate \"are scorched\" (on the authority of Ezekiel 15:4), and attach the word rendered \"of the fire\" to the first clause; the half-verse would then run: \"The bellows are scorched through the fire; the lead is consumed,\" i.e. the bellows are even scorched through the heat of the furnace, and the lead has become entirely oxydized. But this requires us to alter the verb from the masculine to the feminine form of third sing. perf. (reading tammah). It is better, therefore, to give the verb (which will be Kal, if the nun be radical) the sense of \"snorting,\" which it has in Aramaic and in Arabic, and which the corresponding noun has in Hebrew (Jeremiah 8:16; Job 39:20; Job 41:12). The masculine form of the verb rendered \"is consumed\" is still a difficulty; but we have a better right to suppose that the first letter of tittom was dropped, owing to its identity with the second letter, than to append (as the first view would require us) an entirely different letter at the end. This being done, the whole passage becomes clear: \"The bellows puff, (that) the lead may be consumed of the fire.\" In any case, the general meaning is obvious. The assayer has spared no trouble, all the rules of his art have been obeyed, but no silver appears as the result of the process. Lead is mentioned, because, before quicksilver was known, it was employed as a flux in the operation of smelting, Plucked away; rather, separated, like the dross from the silver.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Reprobate silver... rejected them; rather, refuse silver (as the margin)... refused them. The verbal root is the same.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - The Divine requirements and the corresponding promise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Stand in the gate; i.e. not an outer gate (for the outer court would be filled with the people whom Jeremiah was to address), but one of the three gates which led from the inner court to the outer. Probably it was the gate where Baruch recited the prophecies of Jeremiah at a later period, and which is designated \"the new gate of the Lord's house,\" and said to have been situated in the \"upper\" i.e. inner court (Jeremiah 36:10; comp. Jeremiah 26:10). We may conjecture that either one of the three great festivals or some extraordinary fast had brought a large number of people together at the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The temple of the Lord. Notice the iteration of the phrase, as if its very sound were a charm against evil. It reminds us of the performances of the howling dervishes at Cairo, who \"sometimes remain for hours, incessantly shouting the Muslim confession of faith (la ilaha, etc.)\" (Dr. Ebers, in Badeker's 'Egypt,' p. 150). The phrase is repeated three times to express earnestness of the speakers (comp. Jeremiah 22:29, \"O earth, earth, earth\"). These false prophets evidently retained a large amount of the old materialistic faith of the Semitic nations (to whom the Israelites belonged by race), which localized the presence and the power of the divinity. The temple was, in fact, their palladium, and as long as it stood, the national independence appeared to them to be secured. They faithfully handed on the teaching of those prophets of the last generation, who, as Micah tells us (Micah 3:11), were wont to \"lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.\" How Isaiah met this error we may collect from Isaiah 28:16 (see my Commentary). Are these; i.e. these buildings (comp. 2 Chronicles 8:11, where for \"the places\" the Hebrew has \"these\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If ye thoroughly amend, etc.; a development of the ides of ver. 3. The true palladium of Judah would be the faithful performance of Jehovah's moral laws, especially those referring to the conduct of the rulers. Observe the stress which all the prophets lay on the virtues of civil life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The stranger, the fatherless, and the widow; specially commended to the care of the Israelites (Exodus 22:21, 22 - a passage belonging to one of the most evidently primitive portions of the Pentateuch; Deuteronomy 24:17, 19, 21; Deuteronomy 27:19; comp. Isaiah 1:17, 23; Isaiah 10:2; Ezekiel 22:7). In plus; i.e. specially in Jerusalem, but not altogether excluding the rest of the kingdom (see vers. 3, 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. -Forever and ever. It is doubtful, both here and in Jeremiah 25:5, whether these words should be joined to \"gave\" or \"cause you to dwell.\" Still, the latter connection is both in itself the more probable one, and that suggested first of all by the accentuation (this, however, is not here decisive). It was not the extent of the original premise, but that of the enjoyment of the gift, which was in question. A more exact rendering of the prophet's formula is that of the Septuagint ἐξ αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως αἰῶνος: i.e. from the most remote antiquity to the most distant future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-15.

The construction is formed by a series of infinitives, preceded by an interrogative expressing extreme surprise, equivalent to \"Is this your way of life - a course of theft, and so forth?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And come, etc.; rather, and then ye come, etc. We are delivered to do, etc.; rather, we have escaped, in order to do, etc. To make the concluding words of the verse a part of the speech seems hardly fair to the Jews, who would certainly not proclaim that they had made their escape from the threatened judgment with the object of prosecuting abominable acts. Such a view, moreover, greatly weakens the force of the emphatic \"We have escaped.\" \"In order to do,\" etc., are the words of the prophet, who thus lays bare the secret intentions of these formal worshippers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Even I have seen it; understand, \"and I will therefore destroy the house which gives shelter to evil-doers.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh. Jeremiah attacks this false confidence in the temple of Jerusalem, by pointing to the destruction of an earlier sanctuary, of which very little is known, indeed only so much as to give an edge to our desire for more. It is certain, from Joshua 18:1 and 1 Samuel 4:3, that the tabernacle and the ark found a resting-place at Shiloh (an Ephraimitish town to the north of Bethel), nearly the whole of the period of the judges, or more exactly between the latter days of Joshua (Joshua 18:1) and the death of Eli (1 Samuel 4:3). Manifestly, then, there must have been some sort of \"house,\" i.e. temple, at Shiloh; a mere tent would not have been sufficient for so long a period. This presumption is confirmed by the language of Jeremiah, and by the expressions of the narrative books. The fate which the prophet is bidden to announce for the existing temple is analogous to that which fell upon \"Jehovah's place in Shiloh.\" The latter was, therefore, not merely a deportation of the ark, such as is referred to in 1 Samuel 5. And when the narrator of the times of Samuel speaks of Eli as \"sitting by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah\" (1 Samuel 1:9), is it more natural to suppose t the word \"temple\" is here applied to the tabernacle, or that there was really a house, however rude, as sacred in the eyes of the faithful as was afterwards the splendid temple at Jerusalem? The latter view is strongly confirmed by Judges 18:31, \"All the time that the house of God in Shiloh existed\" (Authorized Version is misleading), and Judges 19:18, where the Levite travelling to Mount Ephraim says, \"I am going to the house of Jehovah.\" It is no doubt strange at first sight that so little information is given us as to this central sanctuary of the true religion; but are there not other omissions (especially in the history of the judges), which are equally strange as long as we look upon the Old Testament as primarily an historical document? We do know something, however, and more than is generally suspected; for when the right translation is restored in Judges 18:31, it follows, from a comparison of this and the preceding verse, that the temple of Shiloh was destroyed simultaneously with the captivity of the northern tribes. The impression produced by this emphatic announcement of Jeremiah is revealed to us by a later passage in his book (see Jeremiah 26.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Rising up early and speaking; i.e. speaking zealously and continually (so ver. 25; Jeremiah 25:4; Jeremiah 26:5; Jeremiah 29:19). It is an expression peculiar to Jeremiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - To Shiloh.

The land of Israel was in a special sense \"Jehovah's land\" (Hosea 9:3; Leviticus 25:23). Ephraim; here used for the northern tribes collectively, as Isaiah 7:2; Hosea 4:17; Hosea 5:9; Hosea 12:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-20. - The hypocrisy of the worship of Jehovah proved; its punishment. Verse 16. - Pray not thou for this people. Abraham prayed for Sodom (Genesis 18:23-32); Moses and Samuel for Israel (Exodus 32:11-14; Exodus 17:11; Numbers 14:13-20; Psalm 106:23; 1 Samuel 7:9, 10; 1 Samuel 12:17, 18, 23); and Jeremiah would fain perform the same pious duty to his people. We have a specimen of his intercession in Jeremiah 14:19-22 (comp. Jeremiah 18:20), followed immediately by a rejection of his prayer, parallel in thought to the present passage. Verbal parallels are Jeremiah 11:14; Jeremiah 14:11.

All ages were represented in this idolatrous act, thus justifying the sweeping character of the judgment as described in Jeremiah 6:11. Cakes (comp. Jeremiah 44:19). The word is peculiar (kavvanim), and perhaps entered Palestine together with the foreign rite to which the cakes belonged. Various conjectures have been offered as to their nature, but without any demonstrable ground. Sacrificial cakes were not uncommon. Hosea refers to the luscious raisin-cakes used by idolaters (Hosea 3:1). To the queen of heaven. This title of a divinity only occurs in Jeremiah (here and in Jeremiah 44:17-19, 25). It reminds us, first, of titles (such as \"queen of the gods\") of the Babylonic-Assyrian goddesses, Bilat (Beltis) and Istar, who, though divided in later times, were \"originally but two forms of the same goddess\" (Sayce, Transactions of Society of Biblical Archaeology, 3:169). It is, however, perhaps an objection to the view that Bilat or Istar is intended, that neither here nor in Jeremiah 44. is there any allusion to that characteristic lascivious custom which was connected in Babylonia with the worship of Istar (Herod., 1:199). The phrase has, however, another association. It reminds us, in the second place, of the Egyptian goddess Neith, \"the mother of the gods.\" The first mention of \"the queen of heaven\" in Jeremiah occurs in the reign of Jehoiakim, who was placed on the throne by Pharaoh-Necho, one of the Saite dynasty (Says was the seat of the worship of Neith). If the \"queen of heaven\" were a Babylonic-Assyrian goddess, we should have looked for the introduction of her cultus at an earlier period (e.g. under Ahaz). But it was in accordance with the principles of polytheism (and the mass of the Jews had an irresistible tendency to polytheism), to adopt the patron-deity of the suzerain. Subsequently Judah became the subject of Nebuchadnezzar; thus it was equally natural to give up the worship of an Egyptian deity. Jewish colonists in Migdol would as naturally revert to the cultus of the Egyptian \"mother of the gods\" (see Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' Breslau, 1874, pp. 349-351). The form of the word rendered \"queen\" being very uncommon, another reading, pronounced in the same way, obtained currency. This should be rendered, not \"frame,\" or \"workmanship\" (as Authorized Version, margin), but \"service.\" The context, however, evidently requires a person.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Do they provoke me, etc.? literally, Is it me that they provoke (or, vex)?

That all creation shares in the curse of man is repeatedly affirmed in the Old Testament as well as the New. Inferentially, this doctrine appears from the narrative of the Fall, and still more clearly from Isaiah's description of Paradise regained (11.). Hosea speaks of sufferings of the animals arising out of the guilt of Israel (Hosea 4:3), and a consciousness of the \"solidarity\" of all living creatures is ascribed to a Ninevite king in the Book of Jonah (Jonah 3:7, 8). In general, the origin of this community of suffering is left mysterious, but in Genesis 6:12 it is expressly stated as the cause of the Deluge, that \"all flesh [i.e. both man and beast.] had corrupted its way upon the earth;\" i.e. apparently, that contact with man had led to a corruption of the original innocence of the lower animals. It is a common experience that intercourse between Christianized (not to say civilized) man and the domestic animals produces a sometimes pathetic change in the psychic phenomena of the latter. Is the reverse process utterly inconceivable?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-28. - Jeremiah dispels the illusion that God's claims are satisfied by a merely formal service. Verse 21. - Put your burnt offerings, etc. Throw all your sacrifices into a mass, and eat them at your pleasure. Ye have my perfect permission, for they are of no religions value. According to the Law, the burnt offerings were to be entirely consumed by fire, while the other sacrifices were mostly eaten by the offerers and by their friends. There is a touch of contempt in the phrase, eat flesh; they are merely pieces of flesh, and ye may eat them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I spake not unto your fathers, etc. An important and much-disputed passage, from which Graf, Colenso, and Kuenen derive one of their chief subsidiary arguments for the post-Exile date of the Levitical legislation. The prophet here appears to deny in tote that Jehovah at Mount Sinai had given any injunctions on the subject of sacrifice. But the prophet must at any rate be consistent with himself; he cannot utter anything by Divine command which is fundamentally at variance with other equally authoritative declarations. Do the statements of Jeremiah elsewhere justify us in accepting the words in their literal, superficial meaning? There are three other passages which have a claim to be considered. In Jeremiah 17:26 the prophet draws a picture of the happy condition in which the Jews might be, were they only obedient. One of the features of this picture is that the Jews would still bring all the various kinds of sacrifices to the house of Jehovah. In Jeremiah 31:14 a similar description is closed with the promise to \"satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,\" implying that there would be a great abundance of thank offerings in regenerate Israel. In Jeremiah 33:11, among other blessings of the future, the prophet mentions the praiseful exclamations of those who would bring the sacrifice of thanksgiving. These passages do not contain any statement respecting the origin of the sacrificial system; but they do expressly assert that Jehovah contemplates that system with pleasure, and apparently that he designs it to be permanent among his people Israel. Let us now turn to Jeremiah 33:17-24. Here the prophet, in the Name of Jehovah, declares that there is a Divine covenant \"with the Levites, the priests,\" who shall never \"want a man before me... to do sacrifice continually.\" A covenant with the priests implies a covenant with the people, the priests being the representatives of the people. This passage, therefore, is more distinct than those previously quoted; it does appear to maintain that the range of the Sinaitic covenant included the duties of the priesthood, i.e. sacrifices. On the other hand, it should be observed that the genuineness of this latter passage is not beyond dispute, the whole section in which it occurs (Jeremiah 33:14-26) being omitted in the Septuagint. We have now to inquire, Is there a real discrepancy between the words of Jeremiah (strictly speaking, of Jehovah) in the verse now before us, interpreted literally, and the passages adduced above? Are they more inconsistent than such an utterance as Jeremiah 6:20 (first half of verse), which appears to deny the utility of sacrifices altogether? If the latter may be explained as a forcible oratorical exaggeration, why not also the present passage? Jeremiah sees the people attaching a pernicious importance to the opus operatum of sacrifice. On one occasion he tells them that Jehovah cares not for sacrifices; he means, as the context shows, the sacrifices of men without spiritual sensibilities. On another, that Jehovah never commanded their fathers to sacrifice; he means (may we not presume?) the mere outward forms of the ritual, divorced from the sentiment and practice of piety, which, as Hosea tells us (Hosea 6:6), Jehovah \"delights in and not [equivalent to 'more than'] sacrifice.\" There is, therefore, no fundamental inconsistency between the passage before us and the three passages first quoted, and if so there can be no real discrepancy with the last-mentioned passage, for the priests (as was remarked) perform their functions on behalf of the people, and the permanence of Jehovah's covenant with the priests depended on the spiritual life of the people they represented (read Jeremiah 33, as a whole). This view seems less arbitrary than that of Ewald, who thinks that the sacrifices spoken of in our passage are merely the free-will offerings of the rich; and than that of Dahler, who interprets, \"My chief care was not to prescribe rules for holocausts and sacrifices, but this is what I commanded thee above all,\" viz. moral obedience. According to it, the prophet's denial is not absolute, but relative - relative, that is, to the notion of sacrifices entertained by the Jews whom he addresses. Of course, Graf's view, that the denial is absolute, will equally well suit the context. The people were surprised at Jeremiah's objurgations, because they thought they had fulfilled the claims of the covenant. Jeremiah's purpose is equally well fulfilled whether his denial is qualified or unqualified, absolute or relative. Our object has been to separate the exegesis of our passage from a still doubtful controversy, and to offer a tenable view of it, based upon grounds purely internal to Jeremiah. It may be suggested, however, to the student of Leviticus, that even if the Levitical legislation in its present form were proved to be of a pest-Exile date, it would still be doubtful whether any believing temple-worshipper could help assuming that Jehovah had, from the first existence of the nation, given his direct sanction to the offering of sacrifices. If so, it is comparatively unimportant (except with regard to the progressive revelation of the strictness of the law of truth) whether the Levitical code was given to Moses at Mount Sinai in its present form or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - But this thing... Obey my voice, etc. Comp. Deuteronomy 6:3, \"Hear [the verb rendered here 'obey'] therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee,\" etc. The words, I will be your God; rather, to you a God, etc., occur in Leviticus 26:12 (comp. Exodus 6:7; Deuteronomy 29:13). Walk ye in all the ways, etc., is not a citation, but reminds us of passages like Deuteronomy 9:12, 16; Deuteronomy 11:28; Deuteronomy 31:29. That it may be well unto you is a characteristic phrase of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 43:6; Jeremiah 38:20; Jeremiah 40:9); but is also frequent in Deuteronomy (comp., besides the passage quoted above, Deuteronomy 4:40; Deuteronomy 5:16; Deuteronomy 6:18; Deuteronomy 12:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Imagination; rather, stubbornness (see on Jeremiah 3:17).

And yet \"this is the nation that have not hearkened,\" etc. Truth; rather, good faith (as Jeremiah 5:1). Is cut off from their mouth; i.e. their oaths to Jehovah are false oaths (Jeremiah 5:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-34. - Tophet, the greatest of all abominations; the beginning of the Divine retribution. Verse 29. - Cut off thine hair. The \"daughter of Zion,\" i.e. the community of Jerusalem, is addressed; this appears from the verb being in the feminine. It is a choice expression which the prophet employs - literally, shear off thy crown (i.e. thy chief ornament). The act was to be a sign of mourning (see Job 1:20; Micah 1:16). Some think there is also a reference to the vow of the Nazarite (the word for \"crown\" being here nezer, which is also the word rendered in Authorized Version, \"separation,\" i.e. \"consecration,\" in the law of the Nazarite (Numbers 6.). But neither in this context nor anywhere else have we any support for the application of the term \"Nazarite\" to the people of Israel. On high places; rather, on (the) bare hills (see on Jeremiah 3:21). The generation of his wrath; i.e. on which his wrath is to be poured out (comp.

In the valley of the son of Hinnom. Hitzig and others would take Hinnom as a noun meaning \"groaning\" (Rashi, the great Jewish commentator. had already proposed this view), which is at first sight very plausible. But this name of the valley is already found in the description of the boundaries of Judah and Benin-rain in Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:16. To burn their sons, etc. (On the worship of Moloch (Saturn), see on Leviticus 18:21, and comp. Ezekiel 16:20, 21, from which it appears that the children were first slain before being \"caused to pass through the fire.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah7:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The valley of slaughter; with reference to the great slaughter reserved for the unbelieving Jews.

The curse denounced upon the disobedient people in Leviticus 26:31, 33 (for another parallel between this chapter and Leviticus 26, see ver. 23). In both passages the word for \"waste\" is khorbah, which, as Dr. Payne Smith remarks, is \"used only of places which, having once been inhabited, have then fallen into ruin.\" Hebrew is rich in synonyms for the idea of \"desolation.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - Punishment will even overtake the sinners who have long since been deceased. Verse 1. - They shall bring out the bones. Not only shall many of the dead bodies remain unburied, but the sepulchers of those who have till now \"lain in honor, each one in his house\" (Isaiah 14:18), shall be violated. The inhabitants of Jerusalem meant are evidently those of the upper class, for the others were buried, with but little regard to the security of the corpses, in the valley of Kedron (2 Kings 23:6). According to some, the motive of this invasion of the chambers of the dead is avarice (comp. Herod., 1:187, Darius at the tomb of Nitocris); but the context, without excluding this view, rather suggests malice and contempt. Thus \"the wrath of man\" was to \"praise\" Jehovah (Psalm 76:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And they shall spread them, etc. Not as an act of solemn mockery, for the agents are idolaters themselves, but God so overrules the passions of his unconscious instruments that no more effective ceremonial could have been devised.

The words are certainly to be omitted in the second place where they occur. In the Hebrew they stand after in all the places, and the word for \"places\" is feminine, whereas the participle, \"the remaining,\" is masculine. The Septuagint and Peshito have nothing corresponding. There is a clerical error in the Hebrew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4 - Jeremiah 9:1. - The incorrigible wickedness of the people, and the awfulness of the judgment. Verse 4. - Moreover thou shalt say, etc.; literally, and thou shalt say. The section is introduced by a formula which connects it with Jeremiah 7:2, 28. Shall they fall, etc.? rather, Do men fall... doth a man turn away? One of those appeals to common sense in which the prophets delight. Who ever sees a fallen man stay quietly on the ground without attempting to rise? or a man who has wandered out of the path persist in going in the wrong direction?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Slidden back... backsliding. The verb is the same verb (in another conjugation) as in Ver. 4, and the noun is a derivative from it. The Authorized Version, therefore, has slightly weakened the force of the argument. They hold fast deceit. They cling to a false view of their relation to their God (comp. Jeremiah 4:2; Jeremiah 5:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I hearkened and heard. The Divine Judge condescends to speak after the manner of men. He will be his own witness; for it is his own people, Jeshurun, which is on its trial. Not aright. It is a compound expression, equivalent to \"insincerely,\" \"untruly\" (comp. Isaiah 16:6). Repented... turned; rather, repenteth... turneth (or, returneth). To his course. The Hebrew text, sometimes represented as having a different reading (\"courses,\" in the plural) from the margin, really gives the same reading with one letter misplaced. The singular stands in the parallel passage, Jeremiah 23:19, and offers no difficulty. As the horse rusheth; literally, over-floweth. Both the Authorized Version and the Vulgate (impetu vadens) efface the second metaphor. The uncontrollable passion of both people and war-horse is compared to the all-subduing course of a winter stream or torrent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The appeal to the regularity of animal instincts reminds us of Isaiah 1:3. Yea, the stork, etc. The minatory birds obey their instinct with the most unfailing regularity. Those referred to are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the stork, whose \"regular and sudden return is one of the most interesting natural sights of Palestine. The expression 'stork in the heavens' refers to the immense height at which they fly during migration\" (Tristram);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the turtle, or turtle-dove, whose return is the sure sign of spring (Song of Solomon 2:11);NEWLINENEWLINE(3 and 4) the crane and the swallow, or rather, \"the swift and the crane.\" These birds are again mentioned together in Isaiah 38:14 (the psalm of Hezekiah), where special reference is made to the penetrating quality of their note. \"The whooping or trumpeting of the crane rings through the night air in spring, and the vast flocks which we noticed passing north near Beersheba were a wonderful sight.\" The introduction of the swallow in the Authorized Version is misleading, as that bird is not a regular migrant in Palestine. The note of the swift is a shrill scream. \"No bird is more conspicuous by the suddenness of its return than the swift,\" is the remark of Canon Tristram, who saw large flocks passing northwards over Jerusalem, on the 12th of February ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 208). It is an interesting fact that the swift bears the same name (sus) in the vernacular Arabic as in the Hebrew of Jeremiah. The judgment; better, the law (see on Jeremiah 5:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - How do ye say, We are wise? Jeremiah is evidently addressing the priests and the prophets, whom he so constantly described as among the chief causes of Judah's ruin (comp. Ver. 10; Jeremiah 2:8, 26; Jeremiah 4:9; Jeremiah 5:31), and who, in Isaiah's day, regarded it as an unwarrantable assumption on the part of that prophet to pretend to instruct them in their duty (Isaiah 28:9). The law of the Lord is with us. \"With us;\" i.e. in our hands and mouths. (comp. Psalm 1:16). The word torah, commonly rendered\" Law,\" is ambiguous, and a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this verse is inevitable. Some think these self-styled \"wise\" men reject Jeremiah's counsels on the ground that they already have the divinely given Law in a written form (comp. Romans 2:17-20), and that the Divine revelation is complete. Others that torah here, as often elsewhere in the prophets (e.g. Isaiah 1:10; Isaiah 8:16; Isaiah 42:4), simply means \"instruction,\" or \"direction,\" and describes the authoritative counsel given orally by the priests (Deuteronomy 17:11) and prophets to those who consulted them on points of ritual and practice respectively. The usage of Jeremiah himself favors the latter view (see Jeremiah 2:8; Jeremiah 18:18; and especially Jeremiah 26:4, 5, where \"to walk in my Torah\" is parallel to \"to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets.\" The context equally points in this direction. The most natural interpretation, then, is this: The opponents of Jeremiah bade him keep his exhortations to himself, seeing that they themselves were wise and the divinely appointed teachers of the people. To this Jeremiah replies, not (as the Authorized Version renders) Lo, certainly in vain made he it, etc.; but, Yea, behold I for a lie hath it wrought - the lying pen of the scribes (so Authorized Version, margin). Soferim (scribes) is the term proper to all those who practiced the art of writing (sefer); it included, therefore, presumably at least, most, if not all, of the priests and prophets of whom Jeremiah speaks. There are indications enough that the Hebrew literature was not entirely confined to those whom we look up to as the inspired writers, and it is perfectly credible that the formalist priests and false prophets should have availed themselves of the pen as a means of giving greater currency to their teaching. Jeremiah warns his hearers to distrust a literature which is in the set-vice of false religious principles - a warning which prophets in the wider sense of the term ('The Liberty of Prophesyings') still have but too much occasion to repeat, tit is right, however, to mention another grammatically possible rendering, which is adopted by those who suppose torah in the preceding clause to mean the Mosaic Law: \"Yea, behold, the lying pen of the scribes hath made (it) into a lie;\" i.e. the professional interpreters of the Scriptures called scribes have, by their groundless comments and inferences, made the Scriptures (especially the noblest part, the Law) into a lie, so that it has ceased to represent the Divine will and teaching. The objections to this are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the necessity of supplying an object to the verb - the object would hardly have been omitted where its emission renders the meaning of the clause so doubtful;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that this view attributes to the word soferim a meaning which only became prevalent in the time of Ezra (comp. Ezra 7:6, 11).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The wise men are ashamed. It is the perfect of prophetic certitude, equivalent to \"the wise men shall certainly be ashamed.\" And why? Evidently because they have not foreseen the calamities impending ever their nation. They have preached, \"Peace, peace; when there was no peace\" (Ver. 11); and hence they find themselves \"taken\" in the grip of a relentless power from which there is no escape. What wisdom; literally, wisdom of what? i.e. in respect of what?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-12. - These verses are almost the same as Jeremiah 6:12-15; the differences are in Ver. 10. They are omitted in the Septuagint, and Hitzig regards them as an interpolation, at any rate from the point where the present passage coincides verbally with its parallel. His grounds are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that Ver. 13 follows more naturally on Ver. 10 (\"... them that shall inherit them\") than on Ver. 12;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that Ver. 10 is deficient in symmetry; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that the deviations from Jeremiah 6:13-15 sometimes loosen the connection of the clauses, sometimes sink into the colloquial style. The arguments seem to be inconclusive. Jeremiah is apt to repeat himself (Graf refers to Ver. 14 = Jeremiah 4:5; Ver. 15 - Jeremiah 14:19; Jeremiah 5:9 = 5:29, 9:8; Jeremiah 7:16 = 11:14; Jeremiah 50:41-43 = 6:22-24; Jeremiah 1:44 - 46 = 49:19-21); and the element which is common to this paragraph and to oh: 6:12-15 seems equally appropriate in both connections. It should be added, however, that the cautious and reverent block has come to the same conclusion as Hitzig. To them that shall inherit them; rather, to them that shall take possession of them, i.e. by violence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13 - Jeremiah 9:1. - Further description of the judgment; grief of Jeremiah. Verse 13. - There shall be no grapes, etc.; rather, there are no grapes... and the leaf is faded. It is the actual condition of things which the prophet describes. Elsewhere Judah is compared to a vine with bad grapes (Jeremiah 2:21); here the vine does not even pretend to bear fruit. Another figure is that of a barren fig tree (comp. Matthew 21:19). And the things that I have given them, etc.; rather, and I gave them that which they transgress (viz. laws). The construction, however, which this rendering implies is not perfectly natural, though supported by most of the ancient versions (except the Septuagint, which omits the words), and it is better to alter a single vowel-point, and render \"And I will give them to those who shall pass over them.\" The phrase to pass away is constantly used of an invading host; e.g. Isaiah 8:7; Daniel 11:10, 40.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Why do we sit still? The prophet transports us by a stroke of his pen into the midst of the fulfillment of his prophecy. The people of the country districts are represented as urging each other to flight. True, it is the resource of despair. No defensed cities can defend them against the judgment of Jehovah. Let us be silent; rather, let us perish; literally, let us be put to silence. Hath put us to silence; rather, hath caused us to perish; i.e. hath decreed our destruction. Water of gall; a phrase characteristic of our prophet (see Jeremiah 9:14; Jeremiah 23:15). It is a little difficult to find a rendering which shall suit all the passages in which rosh (gall) is mentioned. In Deuteronomy 32:33 (and so Job 20:16) it is clearly used for \"venom\" in general; and yet in Ver. 32 of the same chapter it obviously means a plant. Another general application of the term seems to have been to bitterness in general, the ideas of bitterness and poisonousness being taken as interchangeable. The Authorized Version may therefore stand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Health; rather, healing. Another rendering is tranquility (same sense as in Ecclesiastes 10:4). Trouble; rather, terror.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The invader is introduced with the same mysterious indefiniteness as in Jeremiah 4:13. From Dan; i.e. from the northern frontier (see on Jeremiah 4:15). Trembled; rather, quaked (so Jeremiah 49:21). His strong ones. The phrase \"strong ones\" generally denotes oxen, but here (as in Jeremiah 47:3; Jeremiah 50:11) horses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A new image to intensify the impression of dreadfulness. Serpents, cockatrices; rather, serpents (even) basilisks. The second noun is in apposition to the more general \"serpents.\" \"Basilisks\" (Serpentes regulos) are the renderings of Aquila and the Vulgate. Some species of highly venomous serpent is clearly intended; more than this we cannot say. The root probably means \"to hiss.\" Canon Tristram thinks of \"a very beautifully marked yellow serpent, and the largest of the vipers found in the Holy Land,\" called the Daboia xantheina. He adds that it is one of the most dangerous ('Nat. Hist. of Palestine,' p. 275).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18 - Jeremiah 9. 50. - The captivity of Judah and the deep sorrow of Jeremiah. Verse 18. - When I would comfort myself, etc. The text is here extremely difficult, and if there is corruption anywhere it is in the opening of this verse. Ewald and Graf suppose an ellipsis, and render, \"(Oh for) my enlivening [i.e. an enlivening for me] in trouble!\" Hitzig more naturally renders in the vocative, \"My enlivener in trouble\" which he supposes to be in apposition to my heart. Do Dieu (1648) wavers between this and the view that it is an address to his wife, \"Quae marito solatio est.\" (See, however, Jeremiah 16:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Because of them that dwell in, etc. The Hebrew simply has \"from them,\" etc. The prophet is transported in imam-nation to the time of the fulfillment of his prophecies. He hears the lamentation of his countrymen, who are languishing in captivity. Is not the Lord in Zion, etc.? is the burden of their sad complaints; \"king\" is a familiar synonym for \"God\" (comp. Isaiah 8:21; Isaiah 33:22; but not Psalm 89:18, which is certainly mistranslated in Authorized Version). But why\" in Zion?\" \"Zion\" was properly the name of the eastward hill at Jerusalem, where lay the oldest part of the city (called \"the city of David\"), and the highest portion of which was crowned by the temple. Why have they provoked me to anger, etc.? is the reply of Jehovah, pointing out that their sufferings were but an exact retribution for their infidelity (comp. Jeremiah 5:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The harvest is past, etc. For \"summer,\" read fruit-gathering (the vintage began in September). The people again becomes the speaker. The form of the speech reminds one of a proverb. When the harvest was over and the fruit-gathering ended, the husbandmen looked for a quiet time of refreshment. Judah had had its \"harvest-time\" and then its \"fruit-gathering;\" its needs had been gradually, increasing, and, on the analogy of previous deliverances (comp. Isaiah 18:4; Isaiah 33:10), it might have been expected that God would have interposed, his help being only delayed in order to be the more signally supernatural. But we are not saved (or rather, delivered).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For the hurt, etc.; literally, because of the breaking, etc., I am broken; comp. Jeremiah 23:9, and the phrase \"broken in heart\" (Isaiah 61:1, etc.). The prophet feels crushed by the sense of the utter ruin of his people. I am black; rather, I go in mourning (so Psalm 38:6; Psalm 42:9). The root means rather \"foulness\" or \"squalor\" than \"blackness\" (comp. Job 6:16, where \"blackish,\" an epithet of streams, should rather be \"turbid\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - No hope or remedy is left; again a proverbial expression. No balm in Gilead. Gilead appears to have been celebrated in early times for its balsam, which was expected by Ishmaelites to Egypt (Genesis 37:25) and by Jewish merchants to Tyro (Ezekiel 27:17). It was one of the most costly products of Palestine (Genesis 43:11), and was prized for its medicinal properties in cases of wounds (comp. Jeremiah 46:11; Jeremiah 51:8). Josephus mentions this balsam several times, but states that it only grew at Jericho ('Antiq.,' 15:4,2), Tristram searched for balsam in its ancient haunts, but in vain; he thinks Jeremiah means the Balsamodendron gileadense or opobalsamum, which in Arabia is used as a medicine both internally and externally. But if Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 24:22) may be followed in his wide use of the term \"balsam\" so as to include the exudations of the \"lentisens\" or mastick tree, then \"balm of Gilead\" is still to be found; for the mastick tree \"grows commonly all over the country, excepting in the plains and the Jordan valley\" ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 336). Is there no physician there? We hear but little of physicians in the Old Testament. They are only mentioned again in Genesis 1:2 (but with reference to Egypt, where medicine was much cultivated), and in 2 Chronicles 16:12; Job 13:4. From the two latter passages we may, perhaps, infer that physicians were rarely successful; and this is certainly the impression produced by Ecclus. 38:15, \"He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.\" The remedies employed in the Talmudic period quite bear out this strong saying (see Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraical,' on Mark 5:26). The physicians of Gilead, however, probably confined themselves to their one famous simple, the balsam. Is not the health... recovered? Gesenius renders, less probably, \"hath no bandage been applied to the daughter of my people?\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jer.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Hebrew more correctly attaches this verse to Jeremiah 8. Oh that my head were waters, etc.! A quaint conceit, it may be said. But \"if we have been going on pace for pace with the passion before, this sudden conversion of a strong-felt metaphor into something to be actually realized in nature, is strictly and strikingly natural.\" So Bishop Dearie, quoting, by way of illustration, Shakespeare's 'Richard II.,' \"meditating on his own utter annihilation as to royalty:\"NEWLINENEWLINE\"Oh that I were a mockery king of snow,NEWLINETo melt before the sun of Bolingbroke!\" The tone of complaint continues in the following verse, though the subject is different.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-22. - Complaint of the treachery and folly of the people; lamentation over their consequences. Verse 2. - A lodging place of wayfaring men; a \"khan\" or \"caravanserai,\" to use the terms now so familiar from Eastern travel, where \"wayfaring men\" could at least find shelter, and the means of preparing their provisions. Comp., besides the parallel passage in Psalm 55:6, 7, our own Cowper's fine reminiscence of Jeremiah: \"Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness!\" etc. Adulterers... treacherous men (see Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:8, 9; Jeremiah 3:20; Jeremiah 5:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And they bend their tongues, etc.; rather, and they bend their tongue as their bow of falsehood, and they use not their valor in (literally, according to) good faith. There is a sad, stern irony in these words, which remind us of Isaiah's (Isaiah 5:22) \"valiant men - for drinking wine\" and of our own prophet's repetition of himself in Jeremiah 22:10, \"Their valor is - untruth.\" A less pointed form of the same figurative statement is that of the psalmist in Psalm 64:3. Upon the earth; rather, in the land. The Authorized Version pays very little regard to the context in its rendering of the ambiguous word erec.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Take ye heed every one of his neighbor. Such was the result of clinging to an unprogressive religion - one which refused to be spiritualized by the prophets. Certainly, if the established religion was so inefficacious, it was self-condemned. Hero we find the prophet depicting a state of society in which the elementary bonds are already dissolved, and suspicion becomes the natural attitude even of a good man. We find a very similar picture in the last chapter of Micah - a chapter, it is true, which stands apart from the rest of the book, as it implies a greater development of wickedness than the rest of Micah and the contemporary prophecies of Isaiah would lead us to expect. Are these prophetic descriptions just and accurate? We may allow something, no doubt, for the warmth of feeling natural to every human preacher, even under the influence of inspiration; but we must not allow ourselves to explain away the obvious meaning of the prophets. The latter and their disciples were \"the salt\" of their country; and in proportion as their influence declined, the natural effects of a non-moral, purely ritualistic religion showed themselves on a larger scale. Every brother; i.e. every fellow-tribesman or fellow-citizen. Will utterly supplant. There is nothing in the context to suggest an allusion to Genesis 27:36 (Jacob). The verb has its common sense of deceiving. The tense should be the present, not the future, both here and in the next verse. Will walk; rather, goeth about (see Jeremiah 6:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They have taught their tongue, etc.; again an intimation of the unnaturalness (in the higher sense) of vice (comp. on Jeremiah 2:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thine habitation, etc. According to St. Jerome, this is addressed to the prophet; but it is better to follow the Targum, which makes the clause refer to the Jewish people. The connection is (as Dr. Payne Smith points out),\" Trust no one; for thou dwellest surrounded by deceit on every side.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will melt them. It is the same word as that used in Malachi 3:3 of the \"refiner and purifier of silver.\" Purification, not destruction, is the object of the judgment which is threatened! Strange that mercy should find place, after the offence of the criminal has been found so grievous l But, lest we should expect too favorable an issue, the prophet adds, in the name of Jehovah, For how shall I do? or rather, How should I act? How otherwise should I act? The continuation is a little doubtful. The Hebrew has,\" by reason of the daughter of my people;\" but this can hardly be right. We naturally expect something to justify the preceding statement. The reading of the Septuagint answers to our anticipations by rendering ἀπὸ προσώπου πονηρίας θυγατρὸς λαοῦ μου, and this is confirmed by the parallel passage Jeremiah 7:12 (comp. Jeremiah 11:17; Jeremiah 32:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - (Comp. Psalm 55:21.) As an arrow shot out; rather, as a sharpened arrow; but this is based on the marginal reading, and is itself a slightly forced rendering. The Hebrew text (i.e. the consonants), and also the Septuagint and Vulgate, have \"as a murderous arrow.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This and the next six verses contain a description of the sad fate of the sinful land and people. At first the prophet speaks as if he saw it all spread out before him. Then, in the character of a surprised spectator, he inquires how this came to pass, and receives the Divine answer, that it is the doom of self-willed rebellion. The habitations should rather be pastures. The country, once covered with grazing flocks and herds, is now so utterly waste that even the birds cannot find subsistence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I will make, etc. Notice how the utterances of the prophets stand side by side with those of Jehovah. A true prophet has no personal views; so that whether his revelations are expressed in the one form or the other makes no difference. Dragons; rather, jackals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For what the land perisheth. A closer rendering would be more forcible: Wherefore hath the land perished, is it burned up like the wilderness with none that passeth throughNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - There is no answer, for the wise men are ashamed (Jeremiah 8:9); so Jehovah himself takes up his speech. My law which I set before them; not in reference to the publication of the Law on Sinai, but, as Keil rightly points out, to the oral exhibition of the Torah by the prophets. Neither walked therein; viz. in the Law. (On the precise contents of the term here rendered \"Law,\" see note on Jeremiah 8:8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Imagination; rather, stubbornness (see on Jeremiah 3:17). Baalim. The Hebrew has \"the Baalim;\" practically equivalent to \"the idol-gods\" (see on Jeremiah 2:8). Which their fathers taught them. \"Which\" refers to both clauses, i.e. to the obstinacy and the Baal-worship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I will feed them... with wormwood. A figure for the bitter privations of captivity (comp. Lamentations 3:15, \"He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood\"). Wormwood and gall - i.e., the poppy (Tristram) - are combined again in Deuteronomy 29:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. I will scatter them also, etc. (comp. Deuteronomy 28:64; Leviticus 26:33). I will send a [the] sword after them. Even in the land of their captivity they shall have no rest. A special prophecy to the same effect was addressed to the Jewish fugitives in Egypt (Jeremiah 44:27). In both cases it is the unbelievers who are referred to; the nation as such was, through its Divine calling, indestructible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-22. - A new scene is introduced. To give an idea of the greatness of the impending blow, all the skilled mourners are sent for to raise the cry of lamentation. But no, this is not enough. So large will be the number of the dead that all the women must take their part in the doleful office. The description of the mourning women is as true to modern as to ancient life in the East. \"And, indeed,\" says Dr. Shaw, a thoughtful traveler and an ornament of Oxford in the dark eighteenth century, \"they perform their parts with such proper sounds, gestures, and commotions, that they rarely fail to work up the assembly into some extraordinary pitch of thoughtfulness and sorrow\" ('Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 242; comp. Amos 5:16; Ecclesiastes 12:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - That our eyes may run down, etc.; a justification of this artificial system-The piercing notes of the hired mourners are to relieve the sorrow of the afflicted by forcing for it a vent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Forsaken; rather, left. Our dwellings have cast us out; rather, they hare cast down our dwellings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Yet hear; rather, for hear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Death is come up, etc. \"Death,\" equivalent to \"pestilence\" (as Jeremiah 15:2), the most dreaded foe of a besieged population. (For the figure, comp. Joel 2:9.) The children from without. The ideal of Zechariah is that \"the streets of the city should be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof\" (Jeremiah 8:5). But the pitiless reaper, Death, shall cut off even \"the playful child from the street\" (so we might render more literally). Streets, in the parallel clause, means the \"broad places\" where men congregate to toll the news.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Speak, Thus saith the Lord. These words are in three important respects contrary to the style of Jeremiah:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) such a prefix as \"speak\" is unique;NEWLINENEWLINE(2). such a phrase as כה נאם is also unique m Jeremiah;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) when our prophet does use the formula נאם it is not at the beginning of a verse.NEWLINENEWLINEThey are omitted by the Septuagint translator, who presumably did not find them in his copy of the Hebrew, and the text gains greatly by their removal. The following words are mistranslated in the Authorized Version, and should run, not even, but and, the carcasses of men shall fall; etc. It is most improbable, however, that a fresh Divine revelation should begin with \"and.\" With other points, the word rendered \"speak\" would mean \"pestilence.\" Possibly the word fell out of Ver. 21, where it would find an excellent place in the second clause (as an explanatory parallel to \"death,\" as in Psalm 78:50), which would thus obtain greater roundness and symmetry. As the handful; i.e. as thickly as one heap of corn succeeds another under the deft hand of the leaper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - These two verses were hardly composed for their present position, though a connection may, of course, be thought out for them. Perhaps a comparison of Habakkuk 3:17, 18, may help us. There the prophet looks forward to a complete desolation resulting from the Chaldean invasion, and yet declares that he can even exult in his God. So here. All subjects of boasting have been proved untrustworthy; but one remains - not wisdom, not valor, not riches, but the knowledge of the revealed God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The knowledge of God relates to three leading attributes, the combination of which is very instructive. First, loving-kindness. This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination \"loving-kindness and faithfulness\" (Psalm 85:10, corrected version), and as here (comp. Psalm 5:7, 8; Psalm 36:5, 6), \"mercy and righteousness.\" Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his \"loving-kindness,\" vouchsafes. Next, judgment, or justice. Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. Jeremiah 21:12). Then, righteousness - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence \"righteousness\" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the \"plan of salvation.\" It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - A further enforcement of the doctrine that no outward privileges, if dissociated from inward moral vitality, will avail. Verse 25. - All them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; rather, all the circumcised in uncircumcision, or, as Ewald turns it, \"all the uncircumcised-circumcised.\" But what does this enigmatical expression signify? Hitzig, Graf, and apparently Dr. Payne Smith, think that it has a twofold meaning: that, as applied to the Jews, it means circumcised in the flesh, but not in heart, and, as applied to the heathen, simply uncircumcised (the one-half of the phrase neutralizing the other, like \"a knife without the blade,\" \"angels with horns and hoofs,\" etc.). The latter meaning, however, is surely very improbable, and it would only become necessary if it were proved that circumcision was practiced by none of the nations mentioned but the Jews. This is not the case. There is no doubt that the Egyptians were circumcised in very early times (see the drawing of a bas-relief in the Temple of Chunsu at Karnak, given by Dr. Ebers in his 'Egypten und die Bucher Meets'). The assertion that only the priests underwent the operation has no older evidence than that of Origen (edit. Lommatzsch, 4:138), \"in whose time it is quite possible that the Egyptians, like the later Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity which exposed them to ridicule and contempt.\" As to the Ammonites and Moabites, we have, unfortunately, no information. With regard to the Edomites, it is true that, according to Josephus ('Antiq.,' 13:9, 1), they were compelled to accept circumcision by John Hyrcanus. But it is still quite possible that, at an earlier period, the rite was practiced, just as it was among the ancient Arabs, the evidence for which is beyond question (see the writer's article, \"Circumcision,\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edit.). (On the statement that \"all these [the] nations are uncircumcised,\" see below.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJeremiah9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEgypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - All that are in the utmost corners; rather, all that are corner-clipped; i.e. that have the hair cut off about the ears and temples. Herodotus tells us, speaking of the Arabs, \"Their practice is to cut the hair in a ring, away from the temples\" (3:8); and among the representatives of various nations, colored figures of whom are given in the tomb of Rameses III., we find some with a square place shaved just above the temples. The hair below this shaven place was allowed to grow long, and then plaited into a leek. It is to such customs that Jeremiah alludes here and in Jeremiah 25:23; Jeremiah 49:32. A prohibition is directed against them in the Levitical Law (Leviticus 19:27; Leviticus 21:5). For all these nations are uncircumcised; rather, all the nations, etc. Another obscure expression. Does it mean (taken together with the following clause), \"The Gentile peoples are uncircumcised in the flesh, and the people of Israel is equally so in heart?\" But this does not agree with facts (see above, on Ver. 25). It is safer, therefore, to assume that \"uncircumcised\" is equivalent to \"circumcised in uncircumcision\" (Ver. 25). The next clause will then simply give the most conspicuous instance of this unspiritual obedience to a mere form.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
