"2Chr.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This verse would have been far better placed last in the previous chapter, but now, left without note of time, it purports to tell us that (whereas by the last clause of the previous chapter \"Rehoboam reigned in his\" father Solomon's \"stead,\" and had been presumably accepted as his heir and successor in Jerusalem and all Judaea) Rehoboam, now somewhat later on, repairs to Shechem (the ancient capital, and the prized position of the high-spirited tribe of Ephraim) to receive some final recognition as king from \"all Israel.\" Rehoboam. Solomon's son by Naaraah; an Ammonite princess (1 Kings 14:21, 31). Eurydemus may be considered as a close reproduction in Greek of the Hebrew name Rehoboam. To his son Abijah, by his favourite wife Maachah, who was the third of the wives that belonged to the house of Jesse, he bequeathed the kingdom. Wanting any positive Scripture statement of the matter of Rehoboam going to Shechem, we believe the explanation given above is the most probable, and that it was not any designed stroke of policy, with the view of conciliating or flattering Ephraim. Though no formal statement of it be made here, yet it is quite intelligible that the opinions, feelings, and readiness to express them on the part of Ephraim and \"Israel\" were well enough known, and had to be reckoned for. Shechem. For many reasons one of the most interesting geographical names in all the Old Testament. It was the ancient capital, as Shiloh, near to it, was the ancient seat of the national worship. It was situate in Ephraim, with Ebal to the immediate north, and Gerizim to the immediate south. Its upper slopelands (its position on which is possibly the origin of the name, שֶׁכֶם, \"a shoulder\" commanded a view of the Mediterranean. It was the half-way resting-place, at the end of the second day's journey, for travellers from Galilee to Jerusalem, and hence bore the name in later times, it is thought, of Mabertha, or Mabartha (מַעֲבַרְתָּא), Pliny's Mamortha. Vespasian subsequently named it Neapolis, the modern Nablous. The Authorized Version synonyms of Shechem appear as Sichem, Sychem, Sychar (John 4:5, 20). In post-Captivity times, a new temple on Gerizim was the cathedral of Samaritan worship, which was levelled by John Hyrcanus, B.C. 129. Jacob's well is a hall: mile south-east, and Joseph's tomb two miles east (Joshua 24:32). Almost every one of the references to Shechem are of great interest on one account or another, and to turn to each of them in order is to read the Scripture narrative of the place. The leading references are subjoined (Genesis 12:6; Genesis 33:18, 19; Genesis 34; Genesis 35:1-4; Genesis 37:12, 28; Genesis 43:22; Genesis 49:5-7; Deuteronomy 27:11; Joshua 9:33-35; Joshua 20:7; 21:20, 21; 24:1, 25, 32; Judges 9:7, 22, 34-45; Judges 21:1; 2 Kings 17:5, 6, 24; 2 Kings 18:9; 1 Chronicles 6:67; 1 Chronicles 7:28; Ezra 4:2; Jeremiah 41:5; John 4:5; Acts 7:16; Acts 8:5). The article \"Shechem,\" by Dr. Hackett, in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. 3. pp. 1234-1240, is of exceptional interest. All Israel. No doubt this expression may mean even here the assemblage of the federated twelve tribes. Considering the immediate recurrence of the expression in ver. 3, it must be, however, that the Jeroboam party of the ten tribes (headed by the strong and self-conscious Ephraimites) are especially in view; in point of fact, of course, all the twelve tribes were represented in the gathering of ver. 1. There can be no division of opinion about this, though the meeting be represented as one demanded or occasioned by the attitude of Israel, in the lesser comprehension of the name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - In these verses the compiler brings up lost time. He has not mentioned before the name of Jeroboam, just as he has not mentioned the lustful sins of Solomon that led to idolatry, and these sequel idolatries of his, that heralded the shattering of his kingdom immediately on his decease. So we are now told all in one how Jeroboam, in his refuge-retreat in Egypt (1 Kings 11:26-40), \"heard\" of Solomon's demise, and apparently (see first clause of our third verse) heard of it in this wise, that \"they,\" i.e. the \"all Israel\" (of our first verse) \"had sent and called him\" Probably the growing sense of discontent and the rankling in those tribes that were not closely breathing the atmosphere of Jerusalem and the one home county, because of their burdens and taxation, and possibly also Ephraim's ancient and famed rivalry, knew instinctively that this hour of Solomon's death was the hour, if any, of their redemption. The lacunae in the history speak for themselves; for though the tribes, after the long seething of their com-plainings and sufferings, needed but short time for deliberation, Solomon's death must have been an accomplished fact before they (whoever the \"they\" were) sent to Egypt to Jeroboam; and that sending and his returning or otherwise, at any rate his hearing and consequent returning, must have taken time. Considering all this, it is remarkable that no note of time is found. But had only our first verse been placed as the last of the foregoing chapter, the ambiguity would have been less. For the strange variations on the history of Jeroboam (a name, together with that of Rehoboam, new to Solomon's time, meaning \"many-peopled,\" while Rehoboam signifies \"increaser of people\"), as found in the Hebrew texts, and additions to it, see the Septuagint Version, 1 Kings 11:43; 1 Kings 12:24; and A. P. Stanley's article, \"Jeroboam,\" in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. 979, 980; and comp. again 1 Kings 11:26-40; 1 Kings 12:25; 1 Kings 14:13, 17, 18. Stanley's faith in the Septuagint notwithstanding, its variations and additions are not reconcileable enough with either the Hebrew text or themselves to command anything like unfeigned acceptance. One thing may be considered to come out without much obscurity or uncertainty - that Jeroboam was the acknowledged rather than tacit leader of an opposition that was tacit at present rather than acknowledged; nor is it at all improbable, under all the circumstances, that the Rehoboam party in, knowing well how the ground really lay, were as content to let the coronation, so to call it, at Shechem linger awhile for Jeroboam's return, as Jeroboam's opposition party out desired and perhaps compelled the delay. Of course, Jeroboam knew well, none better than he, as of old the overseer of the forced labour and taxation of Ephraim (1 Kings 11:28; 1 Kings 9:15), how grievous the service and how heavy the yoke to his people, even when he had acquitted himself as the most \"industrious\" of taskmasters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The grievous servitude... heavy yoke. These may, for conciseness' sake, be supposed to correspond with the naturally enough hated \"forced labour\" (1 Kings 4:6, 7; 1 Kings 5:13-16; 1 Kings 11:27, 28) and the burdensome \"taxes\" (1 Kings 4:19-28) which had not failed to become more odious to the people as familiarity with them grew. The refreshing New Testament contrast to all this (Matthew 11:28-30) will occur to every memory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This first reply of Rehoboam was not necessarily inauspicious. Yet sometimes, as it proved now, the caution that takes time to consider heralds fatal mistake. This is when either a generous, instinctive impulse, asking an instantaneous obedience, is chilled by some self-regard; or yet worse, when the offended Spirit is restrained, and no inner guiding voice is heard, as Saul found, to his ruin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived. The first practical step now taken by Rehoboam, if he delay at all, is the right and far from inauspicious step. O si sic omnia that followed after! The \"old men\" here spoken of, and not before distinctly spoken of, need not necessarily be regarded as professional advisers of Solomon, nor as a privy council of slate; they may designate those of like age with him, or but little his juniors, and with whom he had chiefly associated for his own society.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - Rehoboam was now (1 Kings 14:21; 2 Chronicles 12:13; but cf. 13:7) forty-one years of age; he was just too old to find any excuse for inability to gauge either the experience, and value of it, of the \"old,\" or the inexperience, and foolishness of it, of the immature human heart. According to the modern phrase, he was just ripe to have known and bethought himself of this. But all rashly Rehoboam casts the die. The sound judgment, real knowledge, opportune and practical advice of the \"old men,\" uttered evidently off so kind a tongue, should have been indeed now \"as good as an inheritance; yea, better too\" (Ecclesiastes 7:11, margin). The reading of the parallel is well worthy to be noted (1 Kings 11:7), with its manifestly pleasantly and skilfully worded antithesis, \"If thou this day will be a servant to this people... then they will be thy servants for ever.\" Our words, however, have their own exquisite beauty about them, If thou wilt be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them. One might fancy that Saul, and David, and Solomon, and angels themselves bended over the scene, and looked and listened and longed for wisdom and love and right to prevail. The young men that had grown up with him. While this expression throws light as above on that which speaks of Rehoboam's old men counsellors, it wakens the question how men of forty-one years of age can be called \"young,\" as Rehoboam was not living in patriarchal aged times. And the question is emphasized by the language applied to Rehoboam in 2 Chronicles 13:7, where he is described as \"young and tenderhearted,\" and unable, for want of strength of character and of knowledge, to \"withstand vain men\" (as he surely shows too clearly now). It has been suggested ('Speaker's Commentary,' 2:562, Note C) that כא (21) should be read for מא (41) in the two passages quoted above (1 Kings 14:21; 2 Chronicles 12:13). The suggestion seems good, and it is certainly reasonable for the requirements of both matter and manner.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Language perhaps never spoke more clearly what was in man. And it spoke in this case the mad infatuation of insolent temerity itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - It may be worth observing that the history is silent of what of hope and fear or other thought and feeling transpired with Jeroboam and his party these three critical days of suspense, as also it was so silent as to what transpired with them during the three days, three weeks, three months, before the first interview with Rehoboam at Shechem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Roughly; i.e. Rehoboam had not \"heard the instruction of a father,\" and had been an ill pupil indeed of him who wrote and taught, \"A soft answer tumeth away wrath\" (Proverbs 15:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So the king hearkened not... for the cause was of God... his word, which he spake by... Ahijah (see, as before, 1 Kings 11:29-31, also 9-39). Rehoboam hearkened not, as Pharaoh hearkened not, but hardened his heart. The Divine word foretold, as the Divine mind foreknew, the inevitable course of the stream, that took its source in and from Solomon's faithless heart and life. Solomon \"being dead yet\" bears his full share of the responsibility of what Rehoboam was, and shortly came to show he was. Everything must fall out as God foretells it shall fall out, not because \"the cause is from him\" in this sense that he has made it, but in the sense that he has pronounced it, through knowing it with an absolute knowledge. It were but a thing to be expected also, that just in the measure that the Bible is the Word of God, it shall exhibit and pronounce plainly the phenomena of his own ultimate fiats, rather than linger to track or describe the uncertainties of human morality or conduct. Let but that result appear, which God has with his sure and abiding Word declared, and the practical attitude and language of Scripture are that it is vain to fight against it; for the thing is of God. It was known of him and said of him. And it carries its punishment or its recompense in it, as of him. It will be noticed, again, how our compiler refers to the incident of Ahijah, as though he had recorded it, which he had not done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - What portion have we in David? (see 2 Samuel 20:1). To your tents, O Israel; i.e. there is nothing more to be done here; all may as well go home. The use, and especially repeated use, of the names, David, Jesse, David, plainly speaks tribe rivalry, if not jealousy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - To the tribe of Judah the family of David belonged. There was less inclination on this ground, to begin with, among them to go to the length of revolting. Though they too are pressed with burden and taxation, yet royal expenditure, residence, magnificence, are all near them, and are some solarium doubtless to them. God said that this tribe and (as is abundantly evident from Ahijah's forcibly dramatic parable of the rent garment) Benjamin also should be saved to Rehoboam and for ever to David's line, and again it is evident that he works in the midst of human event, and moral cause and effect. Israel would not have revolted but that Jeroboam was of Ephraim, and Judah would not have remained steadfast but that, with other determining influences also, to Judah belonged Rehoboam and Solomon and David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Hadoram that was over the tribute ... stoned him... Rehoboam made speed... to flee. Hadoram was perhaps the same as Adoniram, son of Abda (1 Kings 4:6; 1 Kings 5:14), but on the arbitrament of age this is less likely, and certainly it is very unlikely that he was one with Hadoram of 2 Samuel 20:24. Rehoboam must be supposed to have sent Hadoram either to make some \"tribute\" summons, or try some arrangement respecting it, or respecting conciliatory steps. The reception he met warns Rehoboam to make the quickest escape possible, and no doubt opens his eyes fully to what he has done. It was the remanet of his delusive self-confidence to send this collector of taxes to those who had begged some remission of taxation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Unto this day. So our compiler of Captivity and post-Captivity date transcribes the literal words of his copy.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - He gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin. The parallel (1 Kings 12:21) says more distinctly, \"The house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin.\" They of Jeroboam (2 Chronicles 10:16) had flung it at Judah: \"Now, David, see to thine own house.\" Rehoboam, of course, does this very thing. For the first time,formally, Benjamin is now introduced as throwing in its lot with Judah, and the acted prophecy of Ahijah is seen fulfilled; the chiefest of the tribes, and the tribe that came of the youngest and most petted of old Jacob's sons, are now wedded to the end. The tribe of Benjamin lay hemmed in between Ephraim, to which it had once much leaned, and to which (as Benjamin was the blood-uncle of Ephraim) it was more closely related, and Judah, with which it had once been at variance (2 Samuel 2:12-32; 2 Samuel 3:1-27; 2 Samuel 20:1). But exactly on the border-line of Judah and Benjamin rose the city Jerusalem and the temple (Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:16; Jeremiah 20:2); and, beyond doubt, this fact had helped to bring about the much more friendly feeling, if not absolutely close union, that now for some time had existed between these two tribes in their contiguous allotments. A hundred and four-score thousand chosen men, which were warriors. According to Joab, in David's time the men able to bear arms of Judah alone were five hundred thousand (2 Samuel 24:9). Compare the numbers in the next reign (2 Chronicles 13:3), and, later on still, in Jehoshaphat's (2 Chronicles 17:14-18). Both of these show that Abijah and Jehoshaphat respectively had improved the time given to training much larger armies, whereas now Rehoboam was taken by surprise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Shemaiah the man of God. This is the first historical mention (1 Kings 12:22) of Shemaiah. The second is found in 2 Chronicles 12:5, 7, on occasion of the invasion of Judah and Jerusalem by Shishak King of Egypt; and the third, in the same chapter, ver. 15, that he wrote a book respecting the acts of Rehoboam. The expression, \"man of God,\" owns to a somewhat unexplained history. It is first found in the added part of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 33:1), where it is applied to Moses. It occurs once in Joshua (Joshua 14:6); twice in Judges (Judges 13:6, 8); four times in Samuel (1 Samuel 2:27; 1 Samuel 9:6-8); twenty-nine times in Kings; six times in Chronicles; once each in Ezra, Nehemiah and Jeremiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To all Israel in Judah and Benjamin. There is difference of opinion as to who are intended in the expression, \"all Israel,\" already confessedly ambiguous in two other passages. When we consider the mention of Rehoboam personally in the former clause of the verse, it would seem most probable that the meaning is all the people of the nation, resident in the Judah and Benjamin allotments, i.e. the nation called collectively Israel. This will include \"the remnant\" spoken of in the parallel (1 Kings 12:23, compared with 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - This thing is from me; i.e. the punishing disruption; not the precedent causes with the entirety of historical events; this punishing and witnessing disruption is not to be \"lightly healed\" The man who did what caused it, the men who did what caused it, cannot thus each undo what they have done - least of all undo it by the appeal of war. They and theirs will have, long as life lasts, as lives last, to go through the baptism of bitter suffering, and leave a heritage of the same for others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-12. - These eight verses tell how Rehoboam, relieved of the responsibility of attempting to reconquer the revolted, wisely betakes himself to strengthening and defending what was left to him. He builds fifteen \"fenced cities,\" or \"cities for defence,\" twelve of them south and west of Jerusalem, for lear of Egypt; he fortifies certain strongholds, officering them, provisioning them, and supplying to them and \"every several city\" the necessary weapons of warfare and shields.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Bethlehem. This was a case not of actual new building of a city, but of restoring and strengthening it. Bethlehem, originally Ephrath (Genesis 35:16; Genesis 48:7), was one of the very oldest towns existent in Jacob's time. It was not called Bethlehem till long after the settlement of the tribes. It was six miles from Jerusalem, on the east of the road to Hebron. Etam. A place near Bethlehem (1 Chronicles 4:3, 4, not 32; Septuagint of Joshua 15:60); possibly the resort of Samson after his revenge on the Philistines (Judges 15:8, 11). It was not the Etam mentioned as belonging to Simeon (1 Chronicles 4:32). Tekoa. According to Jerome, as also Eusebius, six Roman miles from Bethlehem, and nine from Jerusalem, or else, possibly by another road, twelve (Jerome's 'Pro-oemium in Amos,' and his 'Onomasticon'). It is absent from the Hebrew catalogue of Judah towns (Joshua 15:49), but is in the Septuagint Version of it. It was the place of the \"wise woman\" of 2 Samuel 14:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Beth-zur. About five miles north of Hebron (see Joshua 15:58; 1 Chronicles 2:45; Nehemiah 3:16). Shoco; properly, Socoh, in the Shefelah (Joshua 15:35). According to Jerome and Eusebius, it was about nine miles from Eleutheropolis, on the road to Jerusalem (see also 1 Samuel 17:1). Adullam. In the Shefelah (Joshua 15:35). It was an ancient place (Genesis 38:1, 12, 20; Joshua 12:15; Nehemiah 11:30). See also the familiar passages (1 Samuel 22:1; 2 Samuel 23:13; 1 Chronicles 11:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Gath. Site still unknown. Some think it may be the Gath-rimmon of Dan (Joshua 19:45). Otherwise it is Gath of the Philistines (Joshua 13:3; 1 Samuel 6:17), and of Goliath (1 Samuel 17:4, 23). I.L.P., in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:656, wishes to find it on a hill now called Tel-es-Safleh, on one side of the Plain of Philistia, about ten miles east of Ashdod and south - east of Ekron. See also \"Topographical Index,\" p. 411, in Conder's ' andbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit. Other interesting references are 1 Samuel 17:1, 52; 1 Samuel 21:10; 1 Chronicles 18:1; ch. 26:6; 1 Kings 2:39; 2 Kings 12:17; Amos 6:2. Mareshah. In the Shefelah (Joshua 15:44), now Marash, a short distance south of Eleutheropolis. Zerah the Cushite came here when he was invading Judaea (ch. 14:9. See also ch. 20:37; Micah 1:15). It was taken by John Hyreanus, B.C. 110, and was demolished by the Parthians, B.C. 39. Ziph. Probably the present Tel-Lif, a little south-east of Hebron (Joshua 15:55; see also 24. See also 1 Samuel 23:14-24; 1 Samuel 26:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Adoraim. This name is not found anywhere else. The meaning of the word is \"two heaps,\" and very probably describes the physical features of the site. It is probably the modern Dura. Its site is otherwise unknown. Lachish (see Joshua 15:39; also Joshua 10:3; 12:11); probably the modern Um Lakis, that lies on the road to Gaza. Other interesting references are 2 Kings 14:19; 2 Kings 18:14-17; 2 Kings 19:8; Nehemiah 11:30; Micah 1:13. Azekha (see Joshua 15:35; also Joshua 10:10); it was in the Shefelah (see also 1 Samuel 17:1; Nehemiah 11:30; Jeremiah 34:7). The site of it is not identified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Zorah. The people of Zorah, or Zoreah, were the Zareathites of 1 Chronicles 2:53; it was the home of Manoah, and the native place of Samson (see Joshua 15:33; Joshua 19:41. Other interesting references are Judges 13:25; Judges 16:31; Judges 18:2-11; Nehemiah 11:29). It belonged to the original allotment of Dan, and is constantly named in company with Eshtaol. Aijalon. The modern Jalo; also originally belonged to allotment of Dan (Joshua 10:12; Joshua 19:42; Joshua 21:24. Other interesting references are Judges 1:35; 1 Samuel 14:31; 1 Kings 14:30; 1 Chronicles 6:66, 69, 2 Chronicles 28:18). Hebron. One of the most ancient of cities still lasting, rivalling in this respect Damascus. It belonged to Judah and to its hill country (Joshua 15:54; Joshua 20:7); it was about twenty Roman miles south of Jerusalem. Its original name was Kirjath Arba. In Numbers 13:22 it is said that it was built \"seven years before Zoan in Egypt,\" but it is not said when Zoan was built. It now contains about five thousand population, but scarcely a tithe of them Jews. Its long stretch of history is full of incidents of interest, and is partially illustrated by the references that follow: Genesis 13:18; Genesis 23:2-19, 20; Genesis 35:27; Genesis 37:14; Numbers 13:22, 23; Joshua 10:36; Joshua 14:6-15; Joshua 15:13, 14; Joshua 21:11-13; 2 Samuel 4:12; 2 Samuel 5:5; Nehemiah 11:25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Having Judah and Benjamin on his side. The mention of both tribes just serves to point for us the fact that Benjamin's existence and value were not absolutely ignored, but were for a short while quoted before the kingdom of Rehoboam became called by the name of Judah simply.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts. The emphasis thrown into the contents of this verse is evident and agreeable; the ecclesiastical party acted worthily of itself. The priests and Levites could not bring themselves to offer sacrifice and service to the calves, or to forsake Jerusalem and the temple and the true altar. No doubt a stirring, throbbing history underlay the few but suggestive words which point here the conduct of the priests and Levites. These would not content to stand shoulder to shoulder with priests made not from the tribe of Levi (1 Kings 12:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Left their suburbs (so Leviticus 25:34; Numbers 35:1, 3, 7; Joshua 14:4; Joshua 21:12). Jeroboam... had east them off. This glimpse reveals to us, with exceeding probability, that there had been some struggle on the solemn matter; we may readily imagine that Jeroboam had either tried it on in vain with the true priests and Levites, or had learned very conclusively beforehand that it would be vain to try it on (2 Chronicles 13:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The high places; i.e. Dan and Bethel (1 Kings 12:28-33). For the devils; i.e. for the \"hairy ones\" (שְׂעִירִים). Reference is intended to the idolatrous wore ship of the \"he-goats\" by the Hebrews, after the example of Egypt, and the reference here is either literal or derived (Leviticus 17:7).

The sad knell is sounded all too soon; see first verso of next chapter. Three years' strength will soon become weakness, and three years' goodness will save no soul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The 'Speaker's Commentary' opportunely suggests the probability that we may be indebted here to Iddo's \"genealogies\" (2 Chronicles 12:15). The word daughter here is a correction of the Keri, the Chethiv having been \"son,\" This Jerimoth is the seventh out of a list of eight men of the same name mentioned in the two books of Chronicles. He is not given as one of the children of David's proper wives in either 1 Chronicles 3:1-8 or 1 Chronicles 14:4-7; Jerome says it was the Jewish tradition that he was the son of a concubine of David. It is just possible that Jerimoth and Ithream were two names of the same person. Abihail was second cousin of Mahalath. It is not quite clear whether Abihail were wife of Jerimoth and mother of Mahalath, or a second wife now mentioned of Rehoboam. The contents of the next verse not differencing the children there mentioned, and assigning her own to each wife of Rehoboam, if these were two wives of his, favours the former supposition (our Hebrew text being \"and she bare,\" not \"which bare\"). When it is said that Abthail was the daughter of Eliab, the meaning probably is, as again in ver. 20, granddaughter. (For Eliab, see 1 Samuel 16:6; 1 Samuel 17:13; 1 Chronicles 2:13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - (See last note.) If previous verse speaks of two wives of Rehoboam, of which wife (our Hebrew text being not \"which bare,\" but \"and she bare\") were Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham the children? or of which respectively, if they express the children of both? As the words now stand, it can only be supposed, with all lexicons, that Abihail is mother of the three children on the two-wife supposition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Maachah was the granddaughter of Absalom by his daughter Tamar, wife of Uriel (2 Chronicles 13:2; 2 Kings 15:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Rehoboam was clearly wrong by Deuteronomy 17:17 (note Solomon's Song of Solomon 6:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Cancel in this verse the italics \"to be.\" Rehoboam again offends against the \"Law\" (see Deuteronomy 21:15-17). He cannot justly plead as a precedent the instance of David and Solomon, as in 1 Chronicles 23:1; for this was only justified by the express Divine ordinance, as in 1 Chronicles 23:9; 1 Chronicles 29:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance.

Nothing is so liable to blind judgment as personal affection.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When Rehoboam had established the kingdom... strengthened himself; i.e. while insecure and full of apprehensions, Rehoboam walked humbly and surely, but when he thought his object, simply safety, was gained, his true and worse self appeared or reappeared, and, clothed with self-confidence, he forsakes the \"Law,\" to bring sure retribution on himself. All Israel with him. When we turn to the fuller statements of the parallel (1 Kings 14:22-24), we see that the sins that were at work were not those of king merely, but of people, especially in abominations such as those of sodomy and the immoral practices of the \"groves,\" as well as the ecclesiastical and irreligious iniquities of \"high places\" and \"image\" worship!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Shishak; Hebrew, שִׁישַׁק; Septuagint, Σουσάκιμ; Shishak, Sheshonk, Sesonchis, the Sheshenk I. or Shashank I. of the monuments, son of an Assyrian king called Nimrod or Nemaruth, became King of Egypt as first of six kings who lasted in all a hundred and seventy years, of the twenty-second dynasty of Manetho, reigning in Bubastis. To him Jeroboam had fled for refuge from Solomon (1 Kings 11:40). He reigned An. Sac. 3830 ( B.C. 980) to 3851 or 3863. This makes Solomon's reign A.S. 3799 ( B.C. 1011) to 3839 ( B.C. 971). Shishak's invasion, therefore, in aid of Jeroboam, was A.S. 3844 ( B.C. 966). A representation of it exists in relief sculptured on the south external wall of the temple of Amen, at Karnak, Thebes; and, together with this, an elaborate list of countries, cities, tribes, conquered by Sheshenk or tributary to him, a hundred and thirty-three in number. Among these are some of the very fifteen fenced cities (see our ver. 4) which Rehoboam built or fortified, viz. the three, Shoco, Adoraim, and Aijalon, while the erasure of fourteen names just where these are found accounts, no doubt, for the non-appearance of others of them. There are also the names of Levitical and Canaanite cities, situated in the kingdoms of the ten tribes, but belonging to the Levites who had been compelled to migrate into Judah. The dates given above are those accepted by Conder, in his 'Handbook to the Bible' (see pp. 28-34), and do not quite agree with those adopted in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1287-1294. Both of these most interesting articles will well repay perusal, as well as the article \"Thebes\" in the latter work, 3:1471-1475. (The name and word Shishak has no relation whatever with the Sheshach of Jeremiah 25:26; It. 41, שֵׁשַׁך, a word which, possibly spelling Babel or even Ur, marks the name of a place, and is evidently used by Jeremiah for Babylon or Babylonia.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Twelve hundred chariots. The parallel does not give the numbers. These are large, but not inconsistent with those mentioned in other connections, whether those of Solomon, or, going further back, of Pharaoh. Lubims. The letter s is orthographically redundant in this, as also in the following names, the forms being already plural. The Lubim mean the Libyans, west of Egypt. They are probably the people represented on the Egyptian monuments as Lebu, of Semitic type, subjugated by Egypt's kings in the thirteenth century B.C. They were among the oldest of colonists, that drifted along the coast of Africa, north of the Great Desert, from the East, and are perhaps the same as the Lehabim (Genesis 10:13; 2 Chronicles 16:8; Nahum 3:9; Daniel 11:43; Jeremiah 46:9; Ezekiel 38:5). Sukkiims. Probably an Arab tribe, though the Septuagint Version gives Τρωγοδύται, as though taking them for Troglodytes in the hills west of the Red Sea; so, too, the Vulgate. Gesenius at once renders the סֻכִּיִּים tent-dwellers, and sets the people in question down for some African tribe. They are not mentioned elsewhere so as to be recognized. Ethiopians. These were ethnically Cushites, but the territorial application of the term was confined to the African Cushite settlers. It is remarkable that, in 2 Chronicles 21:16, Ethiopians are classed with Arabians, but otherwise with African peoples, and in particular Egypt (Psalm 68:31; Isaiah 20:3, 4; Isaiah 43:3; Isaiah 45:14; Jeremiah 46:9; Ezekiel 30:5; Ezekiel 38:5). They were many-tribed, and the Sabaeans were a leading tribe of them. It is evident that Shishak could draw from a large and varied dominion subject to his dynasty at this time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Shemaiah (see Exposition, 2 Chronicles 11:2). The princes. These seem to have been a fruit of some original organization with Solomon, as they are not found with David (1 Kings 4:2-6). Ye have forsaken me... therefore have I also left you. The same Hebrew verb is employed in both members of this sentence, and the rendering should follow in like manner (see 2 Chronicles 7:19-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Note, as very apt parallel passages, Jeremiah 13:15, 18; Exodus 9:27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Some deliverance. The Hebrew for \"some\" here is כִּמְעַט. There is plain authority (Ruth 2:7; Psalm 38:10) for translating this word as of time, and the rendering \"a little while\" of the margin, will, therefore, seem preferable. But see next note, and the\" altogether\" of ver. 12. It has often been most justly remarked what grateful note should be taken of the fact that God always is recorded as turning such a wistful, loving eye to any symptom of repentance (1 Kings 21:27-29; Jonah 2:5-9). Who can estimate the loss of men, that the symptoms have been so frequent, so comparatively easily found as compared with the reality of lastingness?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The genius of this verse, nevertheless, will quite admit of the Authorized Version rendering, proposed to be superseded in the last verse. This says life shall be spared, but still severe moral reckoning (that of servitude in a sense and tributariness) shall be taken with the transgressors and forsakers of the Lord! The contrast of God's service and that of men and the world again touchingly recalls the words of Christ (Matthew 11:28-30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Words do not tell in this verse the \"humbled service\" of Rehoboam and the princes; but the position speaks, speaks volumes of itself. Where did Rehoboam hide himself, where would he not have been glad to hide himself, while the treasures of the house of the Lord, and those of his own house, were coolly taken by the foreign soldiery, none forbidding them, nor resisting, nor even making afraid?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInstead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Instead of which King Rehoboam made shields of brass.

And also in Judah things went well. The obvious meaning, \"and still some good was left in Judah.\" There was some hopefulness in the situation, and reason for striving mightily \"to be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die\" (Revelation 3:2). The occurrence of לְכָלָה is somewhat against the rendering of \"some\" in ver. 7 as an adverb of time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The parallel to the remaining verses of this chapter is found in 1 Kings 14:21, 22, 29-31. In Jerusalem. Possibly, considering the words of 2 Chronicles 11:5-12, 17, this may indicate that Rehoboam was brought down to thinking almost more of the safety of Jerusalem and himself than of the kingdom in its length and breadth. One and forty years old (see our note, 2 Chronicles 10:8, towards the end, and compare our 2 Chronicles 13:7, as well as the parallel places, 1 Kings 12:8 and 1 Kings 14:21). It cannot be held as conclusively shown that the age of forty-one is incorrect. An Ammonitess (see 1 Kings 11:1-9). Rehoboam's mother's name and nationality are noted also, and twice in the parallel (1 Kings 14:21, 31). Naamah was possibly the daughter of Nahash (1 Chronicles 19:1-20:3). The briefness but decidedness of the notifications made as to this mother of Rehoboam leaves us without doubt that there is not lacking significance in them. Schulz (in his ' Scholia in Ver. Test.,' vol. 3.) says the reason is \"quia ca filio idololatriae ansam dedisse videtur;\" Keil and Bertheau think that, though there was evidence of this in the case of the mention of Asa's mother (1 Kings 15:13), the explanation here is that Naamah \"appears\" to have had, as queen-mother, considerable influence in the government. They do not specify where they find this to \"appear\" with any marked plainness. It is quite true that, in the successive accounts of the Jewish kings, the name of each mother is mentioned (1 Kings 15:2; 2 Chronicles 13:2; 1 Kings 22:42; 2 Chronicles 20:32, etc.). We should say it is like the book, so Divine and human, called the Bible, to do so far-seeing and far-reaching a thing as to give the mother's name; and practically to say that Solomon and Naamah were (in special sense for Judah) a repetition of Adam and Eve. How far Judah and her line of kings may have correctly said, they were answerable for \"death and all our woe,\" the sacred historians say (1 Kings 11:4, 9-11, 14, 23, 26, 31, 33, 36; 1 Kings 12:24; 2 Chronicles 11:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - These summarizing moral estimates of the character of the succeeding kings are, indeed, common to the compilers of both Chronicles and Kings, though absent, in the case of Rehoboam, from the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The authority quoted by the writer of Kings (1 Kings 14:29, 30) is \"the book of the Chronicles [literally, the book of the acts of the days, i.q. the title of our 'Chronicles'] of the kings of Judah,\" on which follows in the next verse the substantive statement, \"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.\" The authorities quoted here are the works of Shemaiah and of Iddo, and it is possible that the following words touching the continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam, which have not the substantive verb among them, may have been part of the title of Iddo's work, although it is more probable that his work on 'Genealogies' would retain the character of a specialty. We subjoin for English readers a literal translation of this verse: \"And the words (acts) of Jeroboam first and last, are they not written in the words (acts) of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer touching genealogies\" [but Gesenius, sub voce,\" in the manner of a genealogical table\"] \"and wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam perpetual.\" We think that neither our Authorized Version nor Gesenius's rendering probably convey the correct meaning. The hithp, of יַחַשׁ would be better satisfied by the rendering, \"to make a register,\" i.e. \"to preserve a continued register of David's genealogy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - In the city of David; i.e on Mount Zion, an eminence on the northern part of Mount Moriah. Here was the bury-lug-place of the kings, chambers with recesses for the successive kings. To this place of royal sepulture some of the kings were not permitted to be brought (2 Chronicles 21:20; 2 Chronicles 24:25; 2 Chronicles 28:27; 2 Kings 15:7). The chief cemetery of the city was on the slopes of the valley of the Kidron (1 Kings 15:13; 2 Kings 23:6; 2 Chronicles 29:5, 16); another, probably, was south of the city on the sides of the ravine of Hinnom (Jeremiah 7:32). In the king's sepulchres eleven out of Judah's twenty-two kings were laid - David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Ahaziah, Amaziah, Jotham, Hezekiah, Josiah. For Asa (2 Chronicles 16:14) and Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 32:33) places of special honour were found. The good priest Jehoiada also had burial in the king's burial-place (2 Chronicles 24:16). Kings Jehoram (2 Chronicles 21:20) and Joash (2 Chronicles 24:25) were buried in the \"city of David,\" but not in the above sepulchres Uzziah, because a leper, was buried in the \"field of the burial of the kings\" (2 Chronicles 26:23). It is all but certain that these royal sepulchres were in the enclosure now called the \"Haram area.\" (For other interesting and important references, see Nehemiah 3:16; Ezekiel 43:7, 9; 2 Kings 21:18, 26; 2 Chronicles 33:20; 2 Chronicles 28:27.) While Rehoboam was laid thus to sleep with his fathers, Jeroboam's reign had yet four years to run.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the eighteenth year.

As before noted (2 Chronicles 11:20), and as in the parallel (1 Kings 15:2), this name is one with \"Maachah, daughter of Absalom\" (parallel, Abishalom). The different alphabetic characters may be attributed to error, and that error the error of transcription merely. As in our note (2 Chronicles 11:20), the word \"daughter,\" as in many similar cases, stands for granddaughter. Thus the father of Maachah was Uriel of Gibeah, and her mother Tamar, daughter of Absalom. Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:10. § 1) proffers us this connecting link of explanation. On the other hand, Rabbi Joseph's Targum on Chronicles says that Uriel means Absalom, but was a name used to avoid the use of Absalom. We have no clue as to which out of many Gibeahs is here intended. The Hebrew word (גִבְעָח) signifies a hill with round top, and hence would easily give name to many places. The following are the chief places of the name (as classified by Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:689-691):NEWLINENEWLINE1. Gibeah in the mountain district of Judah (Joshua 15:57; 1 Chronicles 2:49).NEWLINENEWLINE2. Gibeath among the towns of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28).NEWLINENEWLINE3. The Gibeah (1 Samuel 7:1; 2 Samuel 6:3, 4).NEWLINENEWLINE4. Gibeah of Benjamin (Judges 19, 20.), between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. This should strictly be quoted either as \"Gibeah belonging to Benjamin,\" or \"Geba (גֶּבַע) of Benjamin\" (see also 1 Samuel 13, 14; 2 Samuel 23:29; 1 Chronicles 11:31; Hosea 5:8; Hosea 9:9; Hosea 10:9).NEWLINENEWLINE5. Gibeah of Saul (1 Samuel 10:26; 1 Samuel 15:34; 2 Samuel 21:6). Josephus ('Bell, Jud.,' 5:2. § 1) states what helps to the identifying of the place as the modern Tuleil-el-ful, about thirty stadia from Jerusalem (see also Isaiah 10:28-32). The Gibeah of 1 Samuel 22:6; 1 Samuel 23:19; 1 Samuel 26:1, is this Gibeah of Saul.NEWLINENEWLINE6. Gibeah in the field (Judges 20:31). Lastly, our Authorized Version gives us seven other Gibeahs, only translating this word, e g. \"The hill of the foreskins\" (Joshua 5:3); \"The hill of Phinehas\" (Joshua 24:33); \"The hill of Moreh\" (Judges 7:1); \"The hill of God\" (1 Samuel 10:5); \"The hill of Haehilah\" (1 Samuel 23:19; 1 Samuel 26:1); \"The hill of Ammah\" (2 Samuel 2:24); \"The hill Gareb\" (Jeremiah 31:39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It is not within the province of an expositor to assert dogmatically that numbers like these in this verse should be deprived of one cipher, and that the slaughter of ver. 17 must be, consequently, similarly discounted. It would be, however, a great relief to faith to be able to give proof that this treatment would be true to fact. At present the numbers can be shown to be consistent with other numbers, such as those of the entire man-population (1 Chronicles 21:5; 2 Chronicles 11:13-17); and this seems the best that can be said in support of them. It does not, however, suffice to bring comfortable conviction. It is remarkable, among the difficulties that the question entails, that we do not get any satisfactory explanation as to how such vast numbers of slain bodies were disposed of in a compass of ground comparatively so small.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Mount Zemaraim.

Presumably it was a mountain or hill above the place called Zemaraim, mentioned in Joshua 18:22 as in Benjamin's allotment, and mentioned between the places called Beth ha-Arabah (i.e. the Jordan valley) and Bethel. Accordingly, it may be that itself lay between these two, or near enough to them one or both. This will quite suit our connection as placing the hill near the borders of Benjamin and Ephraim. It is said to be in Mount Ephraim; i.e. in the range of Mount Ephraim, which was one of considerable length, running through the midst of what was afterwards called Samaria, from the Plain of Esdraelon to Judah. Zemaraim may be so named from the Zemarite tribe, who were Hamites, and related to the Hittites and Amorites (Genesis 10:18; 1 Chronicles 1:16), descendants of Canaan; there are some faint traces of their having wandered from their northern settlements into mid and south Palestine. The Septuagint render Zemaraim by the same Greek as Samaria, Σομόρων.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOught ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-12. - The idea of Abijah in this religious harangue, addressed or supposed to be addressed to the kingdom of the ten tribes, was good, and the execution was spirited. While, however, he preaches well to others, there are not wanting signs that he can blind himself as to some failure of practice on his own part. The points of the argument running through his harangue are correct, skilfully chosen, and well and religiously thrust home on the heart of his supposed audience. The practical trust of himself and his army are testified to in vers. 14, 15, and abundantly rewarded. This sequel-practical trust is the best credential of the sincerity of his foregoing appeal and harangue. Verse 5. - Gave the kingdom... to David for ever. With the thrice-repeated \"for ever\" of what we call 2 Samuel 7:13-16, and the very emphatic language of the fifteenth verse in that passage, in the memory of Abijah, no one can say he was not justified by the letter and to the letter in what he now says. At the same time, how is it that Abijah does not in all fairness quote the matter of 2 Chronicles 6:16 last clause, and of its parallel, 1 Kings 8:25 last clause, and of Psalm 89:28-37; Psalm 132:12? Covenant of salt (see Leviticus 2:13; Numbers 18:19; Ezekiel 43:24; Mark 9:49). The use of salt was ordered first for the meal offerings, which, consisting mainly of flour, did not need it as an antiseptic; afterwards it was ordered for \"all\" offerings, including the \"burnt offering:\" as surely as leaven was proscribed, salt was prescribed (Leviticus 2:11). \"The covenant of salt\" meant the imperish-ableness and irrevocableness of the engagement made between the two parties to the covenant The widespread and deeply significant use of it among other and heathen nations is remarkable indeed, and is attested by Pliny ('Hist. Natal 31:41) in forcible words: \"Nulla (sacra) conficiuntur sine mola salsa\" (Her., 2 Sat. 3:200; Virgil, 'AEn.,' 2:133; Hom., ' Iliad,' 1:449). Some think it a sufficient explanation of the text, \"covenant of salt,\" that, especially in the East, solemn engagements and vows were often recognized and strengthened by hospitalities, as shown to guests, and of these salt was an indispensable element. It is true that some of the ancient indications and descriptions of friendship and close friendships turned on phrases (similar ones, indeed, still existing) into which the word \"salt\" entered, but that these phrases arose from the fact that salt was so general a constituent of human food seems insufficient explanation, where we can find one of a more direct and more directly religious, or, as the case might be (e.g. with heathen sacrifices), superstitious birth. Religion and superstition between them have been the most world-wide, incalculable, and untraceable originators and disseminators of half the possible phrases of human language!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The servant of Solomon. 1 Kings 11:28 is evidently the apter reference for this verse, rather than 26, as generally given.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Are gathered... have strengthened themselves. The aorist tense is needed for the rendering in both these cases; e.g. \"And vain men gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against him.\" Vain men; Hebrew, רֵקִים. This word, and one very slightly different in form, and their adverb, occur in all forty-one times; rendered in the Authorized Version \"empty\" nineteen times, \"vain\" eighteen times, and \"without cause,\" \"to no purpose,\" and \"void\" the remaining four times. It is the word that is used of the \"empty\" pit of Joseph (Genesis 37:24); of the \"empty ears\" of corn (Genesis 41:27); of \"empty\" pitchers and other vessels (Judges 7:16; 2 Kings 4:3; Jeremiah 14:3; Jeremiah 51:34; Ezekiel 24:11). And in all the other cases expresses metaphorically the emptiness of head, of heart, or of reason, with the same simple force of language appropriate, it appears, then as now. Children of Belial; Hebrew, בְלִיַּעַל. This word is found twenty-seven times, and, including seven marginal options, is rendered in the Authorized Version \"Belial\" twenty-three times; the four exceptions being \"wicked\" three times, and \"naughty\" once. The derivation of it marks the one expressive meaning of \"without profit.\" Young and tender-hearted. Hard as it is to put these objections to the credit of a man forty-one years of age (see our note, 2 Chronicles 10:8; 2 Chronicles 12:13) at all, yet, if so, they can only be explained as some do explain them, of a blamable ignorance, inexperience, and instability.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The five succeeding thrusts of these two verses, prefaced by the somewhat self-conscious but, nevertheless, validly pleaded orthodoxy of his own position, are well delivered by Abijah. Jeroboam is scathedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) for his confidence in a great multitude;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) for his golden calves for gods;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) for what amounted necessarily to the excommunication and repudiation of the priests of the Lord, time- and nation-honoured;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) for the mere manufacture of a new-fangled priesthood, and that after the modal of nations foreign and heathen;NEWLINENEWLINE(5) for the fact that, when these were made, they that made them, and the gods for whom they were made, were all three \"like to\" one another - no true people, no true priests, and no gods at all! A young bullock and seven rams The consecration sacrifice for the whole line of priests was \"one young bullock and two rams without blemish\" (Exodus 29:1, 15, 19; Leviticus 8:2). Of course, Jeroboam felt his own position in the matter so weak, that each false, illegitimate candidate for the priestly service must bring his sacrifice, and that a larger one by five rams than the divinely ordered one of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - The professions summarized in these two verses were confessedly formally true of the king and priests and nation, although Abijah and kingdom certainly did not carry a clean conscience in them (Matthew 15:8; Mark 12:33; 1 Samuel 15:22; Isaiah 1:11, 16, 19). They were, moreover, beyond a doubt really true of multitudes of individuals in the kingdom of Judah and Benjamin. And these were \"the salt of the\" kingdom (Matthew 5:13). They burnt... sweet incense (so our 2 Chronicles 2:4; Exodus 30:7; Revelation 8:3, 4). The pure table... the candlestick. Although ten of each of these were made, only one was used, or only one at the time (see our note on 2 Chronicles 4:8, compared with 2 Chronicles 29:18; 1 Kings 7:48). We have not forsaken him... ye have forsaken him. If all the difference that these words have it in them to express could have been put to the credit of Abijsh, what tremendous strength would have now belonged to his position and to his heart!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you.

Even if we accept for a moment the immense numbers written here and elsewhere as authentic, a considerable deduction may be made from our difficulty by virtue of the fact that this word need not mean to describe the actually slain. It occurs about ninety-one times. Of these, in our Authorized Version, it is found rendered, including marginal options, as many as fifteen times \"wounded,\" or by even a less severe meaning. However, whether \"slain\" or \"wounded and slain,\" the alleged, numbers of our present text are, in our opinion, incredibly enormous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Bethel. Abijah was, perhaps, the rather permitted to take this city as the head-quarters of Jeroboam's irreligious worship. Jeshanah. A place not known elsewhere in Scripture by this name, which by derivation means \"old.\" Grove (Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 1035) quotes Josephus ('Ant.,' 14:15.§ 12) as speaking of a place so named, the scene of a battle between Herod and Antigonus's general, Pappus, but Josephus does not assign its site. Ephrain; or, according to Chethiv, Epron. Grove (Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 569) says that conjecture has identified it with the Ephraim of 2 Samuel 13:23, with the Ophrah of Joshua 18:23, and with the Ephraim of John 11:54; possibly the modern El-Taiyibeh (Dr. Robinson, 1:44), about five miles from Bethel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Lord struck him; and he died. The writer of Chronicles here, for brevity's sake, and not to recur to his name again, records the death of Jeroboam, which, however, did not happen till after Abijah's death, in the second year of Asa's reign (1 Kings 14:20; 1 Kings 15:25). That the Lord struck him, may glance at the fearful announcement conveyed to him through his wife by Ahijah (1 Kings 14:6-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Waxed mighty.

In his days the land was quiet ten years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Buried... in the city of David (see our note, 2 Chronicles 12:16). Asa his son. If, according to the suggestion of our note, 2 Chronicles 10:8 and 2 Chron 12:13, the alleged forty-one years of the age of Rehoboam be made twenty-one, it will follow that Asa could not now be more than a boy of some twelve years of age. It is against that suggestion that there is no sign of this, by word or deed, in what is here said of the beginning of Asa's reign; the signs are to the contrary, especially taking into the question the indications given us respecting the tendencies, if not contradicted, of the queen-mother Maachah (2 Chronicles 15:16; 1 Kings 15:13), and it is not supposable that a boy of twelve years of age could contradict them. This point must be held still moot. In his days... quiet ten years. No doubt one cause of this was the defeat that Jeroboam and Israel had sustained at the hands of Abijah (2 Chronicles 13:18-20). It appears also, from 1 Kings 15:19, that after that defeat a league was instituted between Abijah and the then King of Syria: \"There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father.\" And these things, with Israel's new kings, and perhaps Asa's extreme youth, would have favoured the repose of the land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That which was good and right. Our Authorized Version does not omit to mark the first three words with italic type, the simple and emphatic original being, the good and the straight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The altars of the strange (gods); Hebrew, the altars of the stranger, meaning, of course, \"the altars of the gods of the stranger.\" This expression, \"strange gods,\" is found in the Authorized Version about thirteen times for the Hebrew גֵכָר, or הַגֵּכָר, and would be most correctly rendered, \"The gods [or, 'god'] of the stranger,\" i.e. of the foreigner, as it is rendered in the solitary instance of Deuteronomy 31:16. The high places. Comp. ver. 5 and 2 Chronicles 15:17, which says, \"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel;\" and 1 Kings 15:14, which says, \"But the high places were not removed,\" without limiting this non-removal to \"of Israel.\" On the question of this apparent inconsistency and surface-contradiction, see our Introduction, §7, pp. 16:1 and 17:2. Further, it may here be well distinctly to note how little is even the apparent discrepancy or contradiction alleged in this subject, throwing in the analogous passages in Jehoshaphat's history (2 Chronicles 17:6; 2 Chronicles 20:33), in case these may reflect any light on the question. Firstly, we will remove out of our way the parallel in 1 Kings 15:14, with the observation that it is evident from its immediate context that it corresponds with the last statement of our Chronicles (2 Chronicles 15:17), savouring of a retrospective summarizing of the compiler, not with the first statements (2 Chronicles 14:3, 5), which set forth Asa's prospective purpose of heart, his resolution, and, no doubt, his edicts. Secondly, we may notice that there is a plain-enough distinction made by the writer in vers. 3 and 5 respectively - the one saying that Asa \"took away the high places,\" without any further limitation; the other saying within two verses, \"Also out of all the cities of Judah\" (note by the way here the suggestive stress laid upon \"the cities,\" possibly as more easily coped with than country districts) \"he took away the high places.\" The only legitimate inference (taking into account both the words used, and the fact that the last written are found close upon the former, with the significant conjunction \"also\") must be that some different information was intended in the two places. Ver. 3 finds Asa as much master of \"Judah\" as ver. 5. Therefore the natural interpretation of ver. 3 must be that Asa at once abolished \"the high places\" nearest home, nearest Jerusalem, most within his own personal reach; then \"also\" that he did and ordered the same to be done in \"all the cities of Judah,\" and it was done at the time, if only for the time. Thirdly, include the statement of 2 Chronicles 15:17, if we do not insist (as we might insist very fairly when pressed on a point of alleged inconsistency or contradiction) on the fact that now the high places \"of Israel\" arc distinctly designated, and that therein those outlying parts of Asa's more or less acknowledged sway outside of Judah and his thoroughest control are designedly described, let us instead take the help of an exactly analogous (and analogously alleged) discrepancy (2 Chronicles 17:7 compared with 2 Chronicles 20:33), and we find there that the very key with which to unlock the difficulty is provided to our hand. Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 17:6) \"took away the high places;\" \"the people\" (2 Chronicles 20:33) did not faithfully and with a constant heart follow suit, but had failed to prepare, i.e. to turn \"their hearts unto the God of their fathers.\" How well the juxtaposition of these very words would tell, nay, do tell, with the emphatic words of 1 Kings 15:14! \"Nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days;\" and with our 2 Chronicles 15:17, \"Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.\" In both these passages the antithesis is patent between Asa's heart and the people's hearts, between Asa's \"all his days\" and the people's uncertainty and apostasy. The fidelity of Bible history and its non-cunningly, non-fabulously devised tenor are gratefully corroborated by the inquisition made into such a supposed \"discrepancy,\" inconsistency,\" \"contradiction.\" Notice once more the confirming indication, so far as it goes, of the one verb that commands the next verse, as there noted upon. Brake down the images; Hebrew, מַצֵּבות. It occurs in the Authorized Version thirty-two times, and is rendered \"pillar\" or \"pillars\" twelve times; \"image\" or \"images\" nineteen times; and \"garrisons\" once. It appears simply to have slipped from the signification of pillar into the rendering of the word \"image,\" by aid of the intermediate word \"statue.\" It is used of the pillar or statue of Baal in 2 Kings 3:2; 2 Kings 10:26, 27, with his name expressed; and in 2 Chronicles 18:4; 2 Chronicles 23:14, without that name expressed. Cut down the groves; Hebrew, וַיְגַדַּע אֶת־הָאֲשֵׁרִים. The verb here used implies the \"cutting,\" \"cutting down,\" \"pruning\" of trees. It is undoubtedly applied also to other cutting and cutting down, as of the \"breaking\" of a red (Zechariah 11:10), of an arm (1 Samuel 2:31), of horns (Jeremiah 48:25), of bars or bolts (Isaiah 45:2). It occurs in all twenty-three times. It is here employed to describe the destroying of what according to the Authorized Version arc called \"groves\" (Septuagint, ἄλσος; Vulgate, lucus) - a word which with little doubt misleads for the rendering of our אֲשֵׁרִים. Before this same word we have also another Hebrew verb for \"cutting,\" of very frequent occurrence in its simple and metaphorically derived uses included, viz. כָּרַת. The first uses of this verb with the above word are found in Judges 6:25, 26, 30. That word means literally \"fortune,\" but in its ultimate derivation \"straightness,\" and hence supposed to designate, in Phoenician and Aramaean idolatry, Astarte or the planet Venus, who is constantly associated in such idolatry with Baal (Judges 3:7). But see for the first occurrence of the word, Exodus 34:13, where there is no express mention of Baal, but where the idolatries of the Amorite, Canaanite, Hittite, Hivite, Perizzite, and Jebusite are being spoken cf. When we take into consideration the probable ultimate derivation of the word, the fact of the verbs that speak of \"cutting\" being uniformly applied to what it represents, the \"burning\" to which this was condemned (Judges 6:26) when cut down, and a series of statements that represent it as \"set up under every green tree\" (1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 17:10; see also 1 Kings 15:13; 2 Kings 21:7; 2 Kings 23:6; 2 Chronicles 15:16), it not only becomes perfectly certain that \"grove\" and \"groves\" cannot rightly render the word, but directs us with the light of those passages that speak of it coupled with Baal as an object of worship, and that speak of prophet and priest called by its name (Judges 3:7 (compared with Judges 2:13; 10:6; 1 Samuel 7:4); 1 Kings 18:19; 2 Kings 21:3; 2 Kings 23:4), to the strong conviction that it should be at once written with a capital letter, and rendered as a proper name; that it may possibly be a synonym with Ashtoreth, 1.q. Astarte, or a representation in wooden pillar, stock or trunk fashion, of some supposed aspect of her passion or dominion, very likely in the voluptuous or sensual direction (see the nevertheless very doubtful Septuagint and Vulgate, 2 Chronicles 15:16; and Vulgate, Judges 3:7). Conder, in 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 187, 2nd edit., speaks of \"Baal-peor (Numbers 25:3) as identified by St. Jerome with the classical Priapus;\" and adds \"the Asherah (rendered 'grove' in our version) was also apparently a similar emblem\" (2 Kings 23:7). The analogy of the sacred tree of the Assyrians sculptured on the monuments of Nineveh ('Nineveh and Persepolis,' p. 299, Fergusson), which was probably a straight trunk or stock garlanded at certain times with ribbons and flowers, has been opportunely pointed to (see also Professor Dr. Murphy's 'Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 115).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers. What an indication lies couched in this word \"commanded\" (confirmatory of the spirit of what is said above, in our previous verse-note) of the moral efforts of Asa, and that the efforts on which he may have largely relied for \"taking away the high places\" were moral efforts, rather than those of physical force.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The images; Hebrew, חַמָּנֹים. The images spoken of here are, of coarse, not the same with those (noted upon already) of ver. 3. The present khammanim are mentioned seven times beside, viz. Leviticus 26:30; 2 Chronicles 34:4, 7; Isaiah 17:8; Isaiah 27:9; Ezekiel 6:4, 6. Gesenius says Khamman is an epithet of Baal as bearing rule over the sun (חַמָה, \"heat,\" or \"the sun\"), in the oft-found compound expression, בַֹּעַל חַמָּן; he thinks the plural (חַמָּנִים), invariably found in the Old Testament, is short for בְּעָלִים חַמָּנִים. He does not agree with the translation of Haenaker ('Miscell. Phoen.,' p. 50), \"sun-image\" by aid of the word פֶסֶל understood, images said to have been of a pyramid form, and placed in the most sacred positions of Baal-temples. This, however, is the rendering adopted by not a few modern commentators (so 2 Chronicles 34:4). Gesenius would render \"the Sun-Bard,\" or \"the Sun-Lord,\" i.e. statues of the sun, representing a deity to whom (see ' Phoen. Inseript.') votive stones,were inscribed. In his 'Thesaurus' (p. 489) Gesenius instances the Phoenician inscriptions, as showing that our chemmanim denoted statues of both Baal, the sun-god, and Astarte, the moon-goddess.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He built fenced cities in Judah. Though it is not said so here, it is very probable that Asa did again the work of Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:5-12) which Shishak had done so much to undo (2 Chronicles 12:4, 5, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side.

In three successive verses the blessings of peace and quiet, and no war and rest, are recorded (Isaiah 26:1; Zechariah 2:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The \"ten years' quiet\" (ver. 1) begins to see its end. Targets (2 Chronicles 9:15); spears (2 Chronicles 11:12); for both, see 1 Chronicles 12:24. Out of Benjamin... shields and... bows. The minuter coincidences of the history are very observable and very interesting; for see 1 Chronicles 8:40; 1 Chronicles 12:2; and much earlier, Genesis 49:27; Judges 20:16, 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-15. - The remaining seven verses of this chapter are occupied with the account of the invasion of Zerah the Ethiopian, and the successful defence and reprisals of Asa. Verse 9. - Zerah the Ethiopian; Hebrew, זֶרַח הַכּוּשִׁי, the \"Ethiopian,\" Greek and Septuagint rendering for \"Cushite.\" In its vaguest dimensions Ethiopia, or Cush, designated Africa south of Egypt, but more concisely it meant the lands we now call Nubia, Sennaar, Kordefan, and part of Abyssinia. And these, roughly speaking, were bounded north, south, east, and west respectively by Egypt and Syene, Abyssinia, Red Sea, and Libyan Desert. When, however, Ethiopia proper is spoken of, the name probably designates the kingdom of Meroe (Seba, Genesis 10:7; 1 Chronicles 1:9); and the Assyrian inscriptions make the Cushite name of the deified Nimrod one with Meroe), which was so closely associated at different times with Egypt, that sometimes an Egypt king swayed it (as e.g. some eighteen hundred years before Shishak, Sesostris fourth king of the twelfth dynasty), and sometimes vice versa (as e.g. the three Ethiopian kings of the twenty-fifth dynasty - Shabak (Sabakhou), Sethos (Sebechos), and Tarkos (Tirhakah), whose reigning dates as between Ethiopia and Egypt are not yet certified). The name thus confined covers an irregular circular bulk of country between \"the modern Khartoum, where the Astapus joins the true Nile, and the influx of the Astaboras, into their united stream.\" From the language of Diodorus (1:23), harmonized conjecturally with Strabo (18:821), the region may be counted as 375 miles in circumference and 125 miles in the diameter of the erratic circle, its extreme south point being variously stated, distant from Syene, 873 miles (Pliny, 6:29. § 33); or, according to Mannert's book ('Geogr. d. Alt.,' 10:183), 600 miles by the assertion of Artemidorns, or 625 by that of Eratosthenes. Thence the \"Cushite\" extended probably to the Euphrates and the Tigris, and through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia. Some, however, think that the Cushite now intended was the Ethiopian of Arabia, who had settlement near Gerar (Dr. Jamieson, in 'Comm.') as a nomadic horde. Dr. Jamieson quotes Bruce's 'Travels' to support this view, which seems a most improbable, not to say impossible, one nevertheless. The question as to the people intended will perhaps best be found in the solution of the question for whom the name of their king stands (see following note). Zerah. Hebrew as above. It is noteworthy that the four previous occurrences of this name - Genesis 36:13 and 1 Chronicles 1:37, son of Reuel, grandson of Esau; Genesis 38:30 and 1 Chronicles 2:6, son of Judah and Tumor; 1 Chronicles 4:24, son of Simeon; 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26, Hebrew text, son of Iddo, a Gershonite Levite - show it as the name of an Israelite, or descendant of Shem. Our present Zerah is a Cushite, or descendant of Ham. The Septuagint forms of the name are Ζαρέ Ζαρά Ζαρές, or Ζαραέ Ζααραι, or (Alexandrian) Ἀκαρίας. Although Professor Dr. Murphy says ('Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 116) that \"it is plain that Zerah was a sovereign of Kush, who in the reign of Takeloth, about B.C. 944, invaded Egypt and penetrated into Asia,\" the balance of probability, both from the names themselves and the synchronisms of history, corroborated by the composition of Zerah's army (Cushim and Lubim, 2 Chronicles 16:8) and some other tributary considerations, is that our Zerah was Usarken II., the fourth king of the twenty-second dynasty (or possibly Usarken I., the second king of the dynasty). The invasion of the text was probably in Asa's fourteenth year, his reign thus far being dated B.C. 953-940 (or B.C. 933-920 if Manasseh's be taken at only thirty-five instead of fifty-five years). The alleged army of this Zerah was an Egyptian army, largely made of mercenaries (compare the description of Shishak's army, ch. 12:3). The present defeat of Zerah would go far to explain the known decline of the Egyptian power at just this date, i.e. some twenty-five to thirty years after Shishak. At the same time, it must be admitted that it is not possible to identify with certainty Zerah with either Usarken. Whether he is an unknown Arabian Cushite, or an unknown African Cushite of Ethiopia-above-Egypt, or one of the Usarkens, has yet to be pronounced. Mareshah (see our note, 2 Chronicles 11:8). It lay the \"second mile\" (Eusebius and Jerome) south of Eleutheropolis and between Hebron (1 Maccabees 5:36; 2 Maccabees 12:35) and Ashdod (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:08. § 6). The mention of the valley of Zephathah in the following verse will half identify its exact position. It is probable that Dr. Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:67) and Toblev in his interesting , Dritto Wand.' (pp. 129, 142), have reliably fixed the site one Roman mile south-west of the modern Beit-Jibrin. Mareshah is again mentioned in 2 Chronicles 20:37 and Micah 1:15, as quoted already, in references interesting to be consulted. A thousand thousand. Whether this number be correct or not, it may be noted that it is the largest alleged number of an army given in the Old Testament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. \"At\" some translate \"belonging to,\" some more suitably to the exact connection \"near.\" The Hebrew here for\" valley\" is גֵיא. It can scarcely designate necessarily a \"ravine.\" It is a valley in the sense of being a low, fiat region, in which springs of water \"broke out.\" From Numbers 21:20, the first occasion of its occurrence, to Zechariah 14:5 it is found fifty-six times, and is always rendered (Authorized Version) \"valley;\" it is the word used in the celebrated passages, \"Though I walk through the valley\" etc. (Psalm 23:4); and \"Every valley shall be exalted\" (Isaiah 40:4). The Septuagint, however, do not render it uniformly; but though they render it generally φάραξ, they also have ναπή κοίλας αὐλών, and in some cases the simple word γῆ, as e.g. ἐν γῇ (γε) Ἑννόμ, (2 Chronicles 28:3; 2 Chronicles 33:6), which, nevertheless, elsewhere they describe as φάραξ Ἑννόμ (Joshua 15:8). The full explanation may probably be that the word is used for the valley that narrowed up to a ravine-like pass, or gorge, or that opened out into one of the wide wadies of the country; but see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' Appendix, pp. 482, 483, new edit., 1866. It is supposed that Zephathah is not mentioned elsewhere, but see the Zephath of Judges 1:17; and comp. Numbers 21:3: 1 Samuel 30:30, which Keil and Bertheau think conclusively to be not the same.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Nothing with thee; Hebrew, אֵין־עִמְּך. In the passage of very similar tenor (1 Samuel 14:6) the exact rendering is more easily fixed, \"It is nothing to the Lord,\" i.e. it makes no difference to the Lord, \"to save by many or by few.\" Probably the correcter rendering of our present Hebrew text would be, \"It makes no difference with thee to help those whose strength is great or whose strength is nothing (between the much even to the none of strength).\" Keil and Bertheau would translate \"There is none beside thee.\" For another instance of the preposition גֵּין followed by ל, see Genesis 1:6; and comp. 2 Chronicles 1:13. The prayer must be counted a model prayer to an omnipotent Deliverer. It consists of opening invocation and the instancing of what postulates the crowning Divine attribute as the broad foundation for argument; of invocation repeated, warmed to closer clinging by the appropriating \"oar;\" attended by the defining, though very universal petition, Help us; and followed by the argument of the unbending fidelity of trusting dependence, For we rest on thee, and in thy Name we go against this multitude; and, lastly, of invocation renewed or still determinedly sustained, pressed home by the clenching challenge of relationship and its correlative responsibility and presumable holy pride. The antithesis marked in these two last clauses will not escape notice - one made all the bolder, with the marginal reading of \"mortal mall\" for the emphatic (a poetical, universal kind of) word here employed (ךאגושׁ) for man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - So the Lord smote the Ethiopians. As little as the real work was of the army of Asa, so little is said of even the mere human method by which this great victory was obtained for Asa and Judah. Again and yet again, in the following two verses, the glory is given to \"the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And the Ethiopians... before his host. It is evident that these words, with the clauses they include, should be placed in brackets, and so leave \"they,\" the subject of the verb \"carried\" in the last clause, to refer to its proper noun-subject, Asa and the people. Gerar. This place is mentioned as defining a full distant spot as the limit of the pursuit of the flying army. While it was nearly four hours south of Gaza, on the road to Egypt, it is calculated that it was more than twenty miles distant from Mareshah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The fear of the Lord came upon them; i.e. on the cities round about Gerar. This and the following verse illustrate in particular the very graphic character which attaches to the entire stretch of the description of the scene, introduced so suddenly in ver. 9 and closing with ver. 15. Much spoil. The Hebrew word here used for \"spoil\" (בִּזָּה) is found only in Chronicles, Ezra, Esther, Nehemiah, Daniel, and once in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 29:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The tents of cattle. This word \"tents\" (אָהֲלֵי, construct state) is used just 325 times, and this is the only time it is spoken of as the place of cattle; there are, however, four passages looking the same way (Genesis 13:5; Judges 6:5; 2 Kings 7:7; Jeremiah 49:29). It is the word used for the tabernacle of the wilderness many times, and many times for the place of abode that has highest associations (Psalm 15:1; Psalm 118:15), and of the usual abodes of people (2 Chronicles 10:16). The use of the word here, though unique, will occasion no surprise, considering the camping of the vast invading army. Camels in abundance. The mention of this spoil reminds us both where we are, on desert border (1 Samuel 27:7-10; 1 Samuel 30:16, 17), and what was the personality or nationality within some latitude of choice of the invaders. Returned to Jerusalem. The expression awakens inevitably, though inaptly, a reminiscence of Scripture language in strangest contrast - the climax in a description also, but of a victory infinitely vaster and grander and for ever (Luke 24:52; Acts 1:12). This return of \"Asa and the people that were with him\" to Jerusalem dated the commencement of a period of comparative internal peace and reform for the kingdom of Judah, that lasted twenty-one years, and yet more of exemption from Egyptian attack, that lasted about three hundred and thirty years (B.C. circ. 940-609). It was a doubtful benefit, but Judah and Egypt came to be found in alliance against Assyria (2 Kings 17:3-6; 2 Kings 18:20, 21, 24; Isaiah 30:2; Hosea 7:11). The 'Speaker's Commentary' points out the interesting fact that this was one of the only two occasions known of the Jews meeting in open field either Egypt or Assyria (the other occasion being the unfortunate one of Josiah against Necho, 2 Chronicles 35:30), and adds, \"Shishak, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, and Ptolemy I., were either unopposed or only opposed from behind wails.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Spirit of God came. For \"came,\" read the literal Hebrew \"was,\" as also in our 2 Chronicles 20:14, where instead of \"God\" (אְלֶהִים), we find \"the Lord\" (יְהוָה). In our 2 Chronicles 24:20, we have again \"God,\" with the verb \"clothed\" (לָבְשָׁה). The grand original of the expression is, of course, found in Genesis 1:2, where the name is \"God.\" Compare Pharaoh's question in Genesis 41:38; Exodus 31:3; Exodus 35:31; Numbers 24:2; Judges 3:1; Judges 6:34 (the verb \"clothed\" is used in this last); five other times in Judges we have the Spirit of the Lord; in Samuel six times, and \"the Spirit of God\" another six times; in Kings, three times \"the Spirit of the Lord.\" These passages exhibit incontestably the function, and the manifold function, of the Spirit! Azariah the son of Oded. The Vulgate and Alexandrian Septuagint read here simply Oded; and Movers (p. 261) has suggested that \"Oded the son of Azariah\" is the correct reading for what now stands in the text; these are contrivances to meet the difficulty which the eighth verse occasions, and they are not so simple certainly as the proposal of Keil and Bertheau (following the Arabic Version) to omit altogether from ver. 8 the repetition of the name of the prophet, under the plea that the words, \"of Oded the prophet,\" may so conceivably be owing to a copyist's meddlesome marginal reminiscence of ver. 1. It would have been, perhaps, a yet simpler method of overcoming the difficulty to account that the words, \"Azariah the son of,\" had through a copy error slipped out of the text, except that the previous word, \"the prophecy,\" is not in the construct state, and this favours Keil and Bertheau's suggestion (see our 2 Chronicles 9:29), or rather the suggestion of the Arabic Version, which before them omits the words, \"of Oded the prophet.\" The Vatican Septuagint has the readings in beth verses as Englished in the Authorized Version. Some think Oded may be one with Iddo of 2 Chronicles 9:29; 2 Chronicles 12:15; 2 Chronicles 13:22; pointing out that the Hebrew characters would permit it, if we suppose a vau added to the name Oded. This conjectural attempt to give this Prophet Azariah for son to Iddo seems to gain no great point. Of this Azariah nothing else is known; he is described as \"son of Oded\" probably to distinguish him from Azariah the high priest, son of Johanan (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142, second column, 3). (For the rest on this subject, see note on ver. 8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He went out to meet him; literally, into his presence; but the Authorized Version rendering is very correct, as well as happy in expression (see 1 Chronicles 14:8; also see the remarkable and interesting verse, 2 Chronicles 28:9). The prophet was the leader, the teacher, the suggester of the right and opportune thing to the people, but to the prophet the Lord himself was Leader, Teacher, Prompter, and it was exactly so now. To the very moment, the quickened moment of new thought and for new deed, divinest instruction and suggestion are ministered. The Lord is with you... will forsake you. The original occasion of the beautiful language and word of covenant in the heart of this second part of the verse is enshrined in Deuteronomy 4:29 (see also 1 Chronicles 28:9; 2 Chronicles 24:20; Jeremiah 29:11-14). It is just conceivable that these words by themselves are what are designated \"the prophecy\" (and \"the prophecy\") in ver. 8. They may be in the first place regarded as ancient quotations. They are also characterized by a certain self-containedness and weightiness of matter as compared with the historic illustrations of the following four verses. No corroborative external evidence of this conjecture, however, is forthcoming.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now for a long season. This translation is wrong; translate rather first, And many the days to Israel to not have true God, and to not have teaching priest, and to not have Law. So far no tense is limited, however naturally through the very drift of the passage it may seem that experience is being challenged, and so necessarily the past tense desiderated, not, however, in aorist shape, but in what some French grammarians call present perfect. For Azariah may well contemplate his illustration as good from long of old, to the very moment he was speaking. The unfortunate wealth of illustration to hand of his position may pardon the doubtfulness of commentators as to the source from which it may be supposed he would have drawn his most effective instances. It will not be the unlikeliest guide to follow the triple description of the alleged apostasy, misfortune, or iniquity \"of Israel,\" e.g. (say) it happened to them to not have the true God; happened to them to not have teaching priest; happened to them to not have the Law (this meaning, to not have it authoritatively proclaimed, taught, ministered). When did these three things happen altogether most notoriously? They describe, not the transgressions of an individual king, but the state of the people and kingdom as a whole. If it were possible to conceive the description as a flagrant anachronism, a retrospective post-Captivity amplification, which the writer (in his glow of work and thought) was unconsciously and irresistibly betrayed into putting into the lips of the Prophet Azariah, all doubt would end; for the description would suit no state of things and no period better than that of the divided kingdoms, especially applying to the career of the separate kingdom of Israel. Our account, unfortunately, is unchecked just here by a parallel. It is, however, impossible to suppose this without any tittle of external authority for it, much less enough to proceed upon. Some so crave the illustration that they are prepared to suppose all the tenses of these verses present and future rather than past and \"present perfect.\" But, in fact, no doubt the history of Israel since the death of Moses illustrated the language of Azariah passim to a degree beyond all \"that is written\" or that we know. And then we may certainly consider theft the expression chosen, \"many days\" (which some translate \"many a day,\" \"many a time \"), even the word \"years\" not being employed, leaves it open to us to go to short episodes of an irreligious and disastrous character in the history of Israel. Lastly, the long stretch of fully three hundred years, extending throughout the Book of Judges (its last five chapters in right order or wrong)into the opening seven chapters of 1 Samuel, provides one running comment, superabundant almost to repetitiousness, for the illustration of our vers. 3-7; in many cases absolutely picking out the very colours to match (e.g. Judges 5:6; Judges 20:29, 31, compared with our ver. 5). To distinguish and separate the very numerous references that might be made is merely supererogatory, and spoils the unmatched mosaic work of the history (Judges 2:15, 18, 19; Judges 3:12-15; Judges 4:1-3; Judges 5:6, 19-21, 31: 6:1-5, 7-10; 9:32-37; 10:6-16; 11:19, 20; 12:5, 6; 17:5, 6, 13; 20:29, 31; 1 Samuel 2:30 -35; 1 Samuel 4:9-22; 1 Samuel 7:3, 8; 1 Samuel 13:19-22). It is a long-stretched-out history of a practically atheistic, priest-less, lawless life; divided into narratives of invasion, oppression, servitude (sevenfold, the Mesopotamian, Moabite, Canaanitish, Midianitish, Ammonitish, Philistine, and, it may be added, in order to comprehend all internal strife, Ishmaelitish larger and lesser, yet surprisingly general), smart, cry for help manifestly more the cry of pain and cowardice than of penitence and repentance, resolution and vow, and - for another trial and still another - of Divine pity, forbearance, and deliveranceNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Among other patent instances, not the least remarkable are found in Judges 20:35-45; Judges 9:44-47; these forecast and heralded that final rupture of Rehoboam and Jeroboam, which showed the \"house divided against itself,\" and the sure consequences thereof.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Work... rewarded (so Jeremiah 31:16; Ecclesiastes 4:9; Proverbs 11:18; and compare with them the crown of all the rest, Genesis 15:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - These words and the prophecy. In addition to what is said under ver. 1 on the question of the occurrence here of the name Oded, where we should have looked for the name Azariah, it may be noted that it is open to possibility that \"these words\" certainly referring to the language of Azariah, the \"prophecy\" may have in view some quotation more or less well known from Oded, satisfied by the latter part of ver. 2 or By ver. 7. This is not very likely; still, the conjunction \"and\" would thereby better account for itself. Nevertheless, it would still remain that the word \"prophecy\" is not in construct but absolute state, and we cannot count the difficulty removed, comparatively unimportant as it may be. He took courage, and put away, etc. These words may express either Asa's accomplishing of the reforms spoken of in the former chapter (vers. 3-5), or quite as probably his perseverance and renewed diligence and vigour in the same; the language, \"he took courage,\" favours this latter view. The cities which he had taken from, etc. Some say that the reference here and in 2 Chronicles 17:2 also must be understood to be to Abijah's victory and spoils (2 Chronicles 13:19), and that these two places must accordingly be in slight error. If this passage had stood alone, this view might have been more easy to accept, but the words in 2 Chronicles 17:2 explicitly state that Asa had taken such cities, and the mere fact that the history does not record when, nor even show any very convenient gap into which Asa's taking of such cities after conflict with Israel might well fit in, can scarcely be allowed to override the direct assertion of 2 Chronicles 17:2 (comp. 2 Chronicles 16:11). At the same time, the work that would devolve on Asa in holding the cities his father Abijah had first taken, may easily account for all, and have been accounted Asa's taking, in the sense of taking to them, or retaking them. Renewed the altar. The altar, the place of which was before the porch, was the altar of burnt offering. The Hebrew for \"renewed\" is חִדֵּשׁ. The Vulgate translates insufficiently dedicavit. Bertheau thinks the renewal designs simply the purification of it from idolatrous defilements, although he admits that this is to assume that it had been defiled by idolatrous priests. Keil says the altar might well need genuine repair after the lapse of sixty years from the building of the temple. Of the nine occurrences of the word. five are metaphorical(as e.g. Psalm 51:10), but of the remaining four distinctly literal uses, including the present, three must mean just strictly \"repair\" (2 Chronicles 24:4, 12; Isaiah 61:4), and the probability may therefore be that such is the meaning now. Many, however, prefer the other view. The work of Ass, as described in 2 Chronicles 14:3-5, was one of taking away, breaking down, and cutting down; but this item shows it now, in his fifteenth year, become also one of renewing. and repairing.

It is a significant comment on the estranging effect of religious schism (for the schism was religious even beyond what it was national) that so comparatively soon these of the tribes of Israel should have become called \"strangers\" by the side of Judah and Benjamin. They fell to him... in abundance. Another significant comment on the sameness of human nature in all time; the weak and the multitude will see, learn, do duty, less under pure conviction of right, than under the strong commanding influence of observation of where and with whom success goes, even if that success necessitate the owning of the Divine blessing as its cause (2 Chronicles 11:16 and 1 Chronicles 12:19). It should be noted, not for the sake of satire of human nature, but for the inculcation of the infinite importance of godly influence and example. Out of Simeon (see also 2 Chronicles 34:6). The \"lines\" of the Simeonites fell to them originally (Joshua 19:1) within Judah. The difficulty suggested by their being called, apparently, \"strangers,\" and being certainly classed with the comers from \"Ephraim and Manasseh,\" may be variously overcome, either by supposing that they had become more estranged from Judah in religious position than it was possible to them to have become in merely geographical; or that they had in some degree outgrown their own proper habitat, and had to some extent colonized a more northerly region (Genesis 49:7); or that, though, indeed, our compiler's composition undoubtedly places the Simeonites summoned, among the strangers, through mentioning them after Ephraim and Manasseh, yet this location of their name be held accidental, rather than due to special design.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In the third month.

It has been conjectured from ch. 14:1 that Zerah the Ethiopian, or Cushite, invaded Judah in Asa's eleventh year. The present sacrificial festival, in his fifteenth year, evidently was held very shortly after the close of Asa's victory over Zerah This infers a rather longer duration of the war than is otherwise to be gathered from the face of the history. The interval, it is true, may be explained by supposing that Ass lingered long to restore the state of things where Zerah's vast host had unsettled it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - These offerings were probably chiefly of the nature of peace offerings (Leviticus 7:11-21).

This, probably, literally translated, says, an hideous fright for, i.e. in place of Asherah, i.e. Ashtoreth, or Astarte; but some translate to Asherah. The word we translate \"an hideous fright\" (מִפְלָצֶת) occurs only here and in the parallel (1 Kings 15:13), and its derivation root guides to this rendering; but some give it the idea of an object of reverent fear among idols. Asa cut down. So it was enjoined (Exodus 34:13-15). And stamped it; Hebrew, וַיָּדֶק; hiph. of דָקַק; the meaning being \"stamped it\" in the dust, from its upright position, finally burning it. The word is used in 2 Chronicles 34:4, 7; 2 Kings 23:6, 15; Exodus 30:36; Micah 4:13. The word used in the parallel is \"cut off;\" or \"cut down; of course also preparatory to burning. At the brook Kidron. The Kidron was a torrent rather than a brook. It flowed between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and finally emptied itself into the Dead Sea. The references to Kidron in the Old Testament are interesting, but all reinvested with heightened interest from those in the New Testament (John 18:1, compared with what the parallels infer; Mark 14:26; Luke 22:39). The first two references in the Old Testament are 2 Samuel 15:23; 1 Kings 2:37. Passing these, the present place, with its parallel, brings the Kidren valley next under notice as, the place of destruction for Maachah's obscene phallic abomination, and then (2 Kings 11:16) as the place where Athalish was destroyed. Its associations are similar when spoken of in 2 Kings 13:4, 6, 12; 2 Chronicles 29:16; 2 Chronicles 30:14, becoming the \"regular receptacle for the impurities and abominations of the idol-worship, when removed from the temple and destroyed by the adherents of Jehovah.\" In the time of Josiah, this valley was the common burying-place of the city (2 Kings 23:6; Jeremiah 26:23; Jeremiah 31:40). (For Robinson's description of the modern state of the Kidron valley, see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:14-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The high places were not taken away out of Israel. It is possible, but scarcely tenable, that, by Israel, the northern kingdom may be here intended. But for the apparent discrepancy with those places which say that Asa did take away \"the high places\" (2 Chronicles 14:3, 5), see notes under them, and §7. 1, pp. 16, 17, of 'Introduction to 1 Chronicles.' \"The high places\" were hills on which sacrifices were illegitimately offered instead of at the chosen place - at Jerusalem. The heart of Asa was perfect all his days. The words, \"with Jehovah,\" following after the word \"perfect\" in the parallel (1 Kings 15:17), makes the already plain plainer. The exact meaning is that Asa was consistently free from idolatry to the end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Except for an unimportant difference of the Keri and Chethiv kind in one word, this verse is identical with the parallel (1 Kings 15:15). The silver, gold, and vessels were, of course, for the repair, restoration, and replacing of the revered fittings and ornaments of the temple. From what sources and after what victories the father of Asa and Asa himself had drawn these supplies is not given either here or in the parallel, but it is natural to suppose that Abijah's victory over Jeroboam (2 Chronicles 13:16) and Asa's over Zerah would have been the chief occasions to finnish them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - There was no more war. The Hebrew text should be adhered to, which simply says, there was not war unto, etc The five and thirtieth year. There can be little doubt that the text originally said \"twentieth,\" not \"thirtieth\" (see also 2 Chronicles 16-1). The parallel, after the identical words Of the previous verse already noted, goes on emphatically to speak of the fact that \"there was war between Asa and Baasha all their days;\" and the same statement is repeated in the thirty-second verse of the sa1 Kings 15:16, 32). The following verse (33) says that Baasha's twenty-four-year reign began in Asa's third year. Putting the various and apparently somewhat varying statements together, they must be held to say, first, that a state of war was, indeed, chronic between Asa and Baasha (which way of putting need not disturb the correctness of 2 Chronicles 14:5, 6, and of the fifteenth verse of our chapter), but that in the six and twentieth year of Asa, which would be the last or last but one of Baasha's life, latent war gave place to active hostilities, and Baasha (2 Chronicles 16:1) came up to Judah to invade it, and to build Ramah - a course of conduct which was the beginning of the end for him (comp. 1 Kings 16:8; our ver. 10; and 2 Chronicles 16:1, 9).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - For the six and thirtieth year, read six and twentieth. Ramah belonged to Benjamin (Joshua 18:21, 25, 28), and lay between Bethel and Jerusalem, about five or six Roman miles from each; but Keil and Bertheau, by some error, call it thirty miles from Jerusalem, having very likely in their eye Ramah of Samuel, in Ephraim. The word signifies \"lofty,\" and the present history speaks the importance of its position, and would infer also that Israel had regained Bethel, which, with other adjacent places, Abijah had wrested from Jeroboam (2 Chronicles 13:19). The reference of Isaiah 10:28, 29, 82 is exceedingly interesting, and bespeaks the fact that Ramah commanded another intersecting route from Ephraim. When it is said here that Baasha built (וַיִּבֶן) Ramah, the meaning is that he was beginning to strengthen it greatly, and fortify it. The object of Baasha, which no doubt needed no stating in the facts of the day, is now stated by history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The writer of Chronicles omits the pedigree of this Benhadad King of Syria, given in the parallel \"the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion.\" Benhidri is the name of Benhadad in the Assyrian monuments. The Septuagint gives Ader, which tallies with it, For Damascus, we have here Dar-mesek, instead of the more usual Dammesek of the parallel and Genesis 15:2; the resh representing (as in Syriac) the dagesh forte in men. The parallel (1 Kings 15:18) says that Asa took all the silver and the gold left in the treasures, etc.; but the reading \"left\" should very possibly (see Septuagint Version) be \"found,\" the Hebrew characters easily permitting it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The alliance of the King of Syria was sought now by one kingdom, now by the other. On what occasion Abijah made league with the king, the history does not say, either here or in the parallel, nor when he or his son resigned it. For there is, read \"Let there be a league between me and thee, as between my father and thy father;\" the short cut which Area thought to take now to his object was not the safe nor right one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Benhadad was apparently not very long in making up either his mind or his method. The bribe that tempted him, drawn from \"the treasures\" described, well replenished (2 Chronicles 15:18; and parallel, 1 Kings 15:15), was probably large. His method was to create a diversion in favour of his new ally, by \"smiting\" certain picked and highly important cities of Israel, mostly in northern Galilee, by name \"Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtalli.\" Ijon. In Naphtali, mentioned only now, in the parallel, and when a second time taken (2 Kings 15:29) by Tiglath-Pileser. Dan. The colonizing of this city is given in Judges 18:1, 2, 29-31; it was originally called Laish, and became the northern landmark of the whole country, as in the expression, \"from Dan even to Beersheba\" (Judges 17:29; 20:1). Abel-maim. This place was situate at the foot of the Lebanon; in the parallel (1 Kings 15:20) it is called Abel-beth-maachah. It is again mentioned as attacked by Tiglath-Pileser, who wrested it from Pekah (2 Kings 15:29). In 2 Samuel 20:18, 14, 15 it is called Abel by itself, but in the last two of these verses Beth-maachah is mentioned in close connection with it. After this name the parallel gives also \"all Cinneroth\" (Septuagint, \"all the land of Cinnereth\"). The name is the original of the New Testament Gennesaret. It was a city (Joshua 19:35) that gave its name to the sea and western region of the lake, sometimes called so (Numbers 34:11; Joshua 11:2; Joshua 12:3). If there were a little more external evidence of it, we should incline to the opinion of Movers, that the \"all Cinneroth\" of the parallel is the כָּל־מִּסְכְּנות (\"all the store-cities\") of our present verse. But at present we may take it that the two records supplement one another. All the store-cities of Naphtali (see 2 Chronicles 32:28; 2 Chronicles 8:6 and its parallel, 1 Kings 9:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And let his work cease. The parallel has not this, but follows the exact previous sentence with this, \"and dwelt in Tirzah.\" It is the happy suggestion of one commentator (Professor James G. Murphy, 'Handbook: Chronicles') that this sentence may betray that it had been Baasha's intention to reside in Ramah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The affair seems thus to have come to an unbloody termination. The parallel (1 Kings 15:22)is so much the more graphic that it contains the two additions that Asa \"made a proclamation throughout all Judah,\" and one that \"exempted none\" from joining in the duty of moving all the stones and all the timber from Ramah, and diverting' them to the use of building Geba and Mizpah. This greatly contributed to command the road from the north to Jerusalem. Geba. This was Geba of Benjamin, as clearly stated in the parallel. It was a position north of Ramah, whether opposite Michmash and the modern Jeba is not certain, as some think this answers to Gibeah of Saul (1 Samuel 14:2, 5). Mizpah (see Jeremiah 41:2, 3, 9, 10). This Mizpah is not that of the Shefelah (Joshua 15:38), but was situate about two hours, or a short six miles, north-west of Jerusalem, on the Samaria route, and is probably the modern Neby Samwil (see also 2 Kings 25:22-26; Jeremiah 40:5-41:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. The very impressive episode of four verses begun by the seventh verse is not found in the parallel. The fact furnishes clear indication that our compiler was not indebted to the writer of Kings for material. And the moral aspects of the matter here preserved by the compiler of Chronicles show the paramount reasons why he would not miss bringing it to the front for the returned people's better religious education. Presumably Hanani the seer is the father of that other faithful seer and prophet Jehu, who appeared to Baasha (1 Kings 16:1, 7) and to Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 19:1, 2). Therefore is the host of the King of Syria escaped out of thy hand It is plain that, reading the lines only, this expression (remarkable considering its following close upon successful help given by Benhadad, and help unaccompanied, so far as we are told, by any infidelity or untoward circumstance), suggests option of explanation, and would engender the supposition that something very threatening was on the horizon, at any rate. But reading between the lines, and giving due weight to the significance of the illustration adduced of the combined Ethiopians and Lubim (2 Chronicles 14:9-15), we may warrantably judge that Hanani's inspired language went a cut deeper, and meant that if the alliance had been not broken between Benhadad and Baasha, both would surely have been taken in one net (Psalm 124:7), as they would have entered into the conflict in alliance. A decisive victory over the King of Syria would have been any way a grand day in the history of Judah; But such a victory over the Kings of Syria and of the northern schismatic kingdom would have been more than a doubly grand day; it would have been a tenfold demonstration of God's judgment, that \"though hand join in hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished\" (see particularly same Hebrew verb used of a bird escaped in Psalm 124:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWere not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou shalt have wars. Although this language at first seems to be intended for very specific application to Asa, yet as we do not read of individual wars occurring after this in his own time, it is quite within a just interpretation of it if we read it as referring to the inevitable experience of the kingdom. Its head and king had just thrown away the opportunity of blocking out one ever-threatening enemy. What more natural consequence than that wars should rush in the rather as a flood, in the after-times?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A prison-house; literally, Hebrew, the house of the מַהְפֶכֶת; i.e. \"of the twisting or distortion;\" i.e. \"the stocks.\" The word occurs three other times only, all of them in Jeremiah viz. 20:2, 3; 29:26. (For a forcible parallel, see 1 Kings 22:27.) And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time. This may throw some explanatory, though no exculpatory, light on Asa's wrath and violence towards Hanani; for it probably marks that either some goodly portion of the wiser of the people had anticipated of their own common sense the matter of the message of Hanani the seer, or that they had not failed to follow it with some keenly sympathetic remarks For our Authorized Version, \"oppressed,\" read a stronger verb, as \"crushed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - This verse, with the following three, is represented by the very summarized but sufficiently significant parallel of 1 Kings 15:23, 24. Note that the reference work cited in this verse as the book of the kings of Judah and Israel, is in the paralled cited as \"the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.\" Of course, the latter citation was much the earlier in point of time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - His disease was exceeding great Perhaps a somewhat more literal rendering will more correctly express the emphasis of the original, e.g. his disease was great even to excess. For yet, read emphatically, and also; the historian purposing to say that as, in his fear of Baasha, he had not sought the Lord, but Benhadad, so, in his excessive illness also, he had not sought the Lord, but the physicians!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Amid the frequent uncertainties of the chronology, we are glad to get some dates fixed by the agreement of testimonies. E.g. this place and the parallel state clearly that Asa's reign was one that lasted to its forty-first year. The parallel, however (1 Kings 15:23), makes this date one and the same thing with his \"old age,\" while no manipulation of dates can make him (the grandson of Rehoboam and son of Abijah) more than about fifty. And it is somewhat remarkable that, when introduced to us as succeeding to the throne, nothing is said of his tender youth (as, for instance, is said in the case of Josiah, 2 Kings 22:1; 2 Kings 24:1-3). Nevertheless, the apparent prominence of Maachah awhile would tally with the circumstance of Asa's youth at his accession. Another correspondence in Josiah's career is noticeable; for it is distinctly said that when he was only twelve years of age (2 Chronicles 34:3) \"he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places,\" etc. At a similarly youthful age Asa, therefore, may be credited with doing the like, while later on he took more stringent measures, as for instance with Maachah, the queen-mother.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In his own sepulchres; Hebrew, קִבְרֹתָין; fem. plur. of קֶבֶר. The plural designates, of course, the range of burial compartments that formed the tomb of one person or family. So Job 17:1, where the masc. plur. is used, קְבָרִים לִי. In the city of David (see note on 2 Chronicles 12:16). In the bed; Hebrew, מִשְׁכָּב. The use or associations of this word (found about fifty times) are almost entirely, if not entirely, those of the bed of nightly rest, even when not at the time speaking of nightly rest; and this is the first and only occasion that it is employed to link the grave in kindly analogy with the couch of bodily repose during lifetime. The fact might have suggested Bishop Ken's lines in the evening hymn -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Teach me to live, that I may dreadNEWLINEThe grave as little as my bed.\" In the present instance, however, the writer, whoever he was (query, was he the compiler of our Chronicles, or his original?), is doubt-leas led to the analogy by considerations mere earthly than those enshrined in Ken's hymn, viz. by the somewhat \"vain show\" of attractiveness and fragrance (probably designed partly for preservative purposes) with which the place was filled, and which were among even patriarchal indications of faith in a future state. Sweet odours; Hebrew, כְּשָׂמִים. Of the twenty-nine times that this word occurs in Exodus, Kings, and Chronicles, Esther, Canticles, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, it is rendered in the Authorized Vermon \"spices\" twenty-four times, \"sweet cinnamon\" once, \"sweet calamus\" once, and \"sweet odours\" or \"sweet smell\" three times. The chief and determining references are those in Exodus 25:6; Exodus 30:23; Exodus 35:8, 28. And divers kinds; Hebrew, וּזְנִים; plur. of זַן; from the root, זָנַן; unused, but probably one with an Amble root, meaning \"to shape;\" hence our noun, meaning a kind or species, used here and Psalm 144:13 (where the margin renders literally, \"from kind to kind\"), and in the Chaldee of Daniel 3:5, 7, 10, 15. Prepared; Hebrew, מְרֻקָּחִיס; solitary occurrence of pual conjugation of the root רָקַח, \"to spice,\" i.e., to spice, season, or prepare oil for ointment purposes. This root occurs in kal future once (Exodus 30:33); in kal part. poel five times (Exodus 30:25, 35; Exodus 37:29; 1 Chronicles 9:30; Ecclesiastes 10:1); and in hiph. infin. once (Ezekiel 24:10). By the apothecaries' art; Hebrew, בְמִרְקַחַת מַעֲשֲׂה. Translate the clause, and divers kinds compounded by the compounding of art, which means to say spices skilfully treated and wrought into ointments by professional hands. A very great burning; literally, and they burned for him a burning great even to an exceeding extent. The burning is not the burning of 1 Samuel 31:12, 13 (comp. 2 Samuel 21:10-12; 1 Chronicles 10:12), but the burning of spices, indicated by the language of our 2 Chronicles 21:19 and Jeremiah 34:5.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jehoshaphat. In 2 Chronicles 20:31 and 1 Kings 22:41, 42 we are told that Jehoshaphat was now thirty-five years of age. He must, therefore, have been born when Asa was in the sixth year of his reign, and presumably not under sixteen years of age. His reign extended to twenty-five years, i.e. from B.C. 914 to B.C. 889. The name signifies \"whom God judges,\" or \"pleads for.\" Ahab is now in the fourth year of his reign, and the symptoms he manifests (1 Kings 16:30-33) are those that the rather urge Jehoshaphat to strengthen himself, i.e. strengthen the defences of his kingdom on the Israel side.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He placed forces; literally, he gave (Genesis 1:17) forces, or a force, or host, or army: חַיִל (Exodus 14:28; 2 Samuel 24:2).

The marginal \"was enencouraged may be superseded with advantage by \"took courage\" (Isaiah 40:29-31). The groves.

This deeper fathoming of the needs of the time, and of what constituted its real safety, was greatly to the spiritual credit of Jehoshaphat. The references (2 Chronicles 15:3; 2 Chronicles 35:2-4, 10-12) are full of point. None of these princes, or Levites and priests, are elsewhere mentioned by name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The moral effect of this peaceful war of Jehoshaphat is manifestly great.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The presents were probably enough in the nature of tribute, the \"fixed rate\" of which is sometimes alluded to (1 Kings 4:21; 1 Kings 10:25; 2 Samuel 8:2), but it is doubtful whether the word מַשָּׂא purports to say this. The word means \"bearing\" or \"carrying,\" and then \"a burden, load, or weight.\" The expression (2 Chronicles 20:25), \"more than they could carry away,\" where this word is used, favours the idea that the meaning here is \"silver of great weight.\" Probably the moral significance and historical interest, whether of this statement respecting the Philistines, or the following respecting the Arabians, lies in the fact that both of them brought, without more ado, their payments, and did not seek to slip out of their engagements with Judah and Judah's king. Note, for confirmation of this view, 2 Kings 3:4, 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Castles. This rendering, better than \"palaces\" (margin), wound bear improving to the rather stronger word \"fortresses,\" Hebrew, בִּירָנִיּות, found only here and in 2 Chronicles 27:4, plur. of בִּירָנִית connected with the Chaldee and later Hebrew, בִּירָה, of Ezra 6:2; Nehemiah 1:1; Esther 1:2; Daniel 8:2, Cities of store (see note under 2 Chronicles 8:4; see also 1 Kings 9:19; Exodus 1:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Much business; Hebrew, מְלָאכָה. The meaning of the word is \"service?' \"labour bestowed;\" and the verse reads, \"And there was to him much labour in the cities of Judah, and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem;\" i.e. He bestoweth much pains on the cities of Judah, and had, etc. The word \"were,\" Authorized Version italics, is incorrectly inserted. The former half of this verse would better constitute the end of ver. 12. Keil, however, maintains the rendering \"substance;\" \"property,\" for מְלָאכָה: (Exodus 22:7, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This verse, with the following four, gives us the names of five captains, chiefs, princes, or military officers for the kingdom's service, with the numbers of the troops they severally commanded. The numbers of them (see note under 1 Chronicles 23:11); Hebrew, פקֻדָּתָם. The better English rendering to carry at once the signification would be, The muster of them, etc. The captains... the chief, In both cases the Hebrew is the familiar word for\" prince\" (שָׂר); in the former without article, in the latter with article. The numbers of this and following four verses are not only absolutely unreliable, but in themselves impossible. According to the house of their fathers; i.e. the quotation is drawn from an army catalogue, arranged carefully by fathers' houses (Numbers 1:18, 22, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The captain. So again read, the prince.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Amaziah, the son of Zichri. This man is not titled at all. The description of him as one who had willingly offered himself unto the Lord, not elucidated by the context or any effective parallel, will mark something honorable in his history. Possibly he comes from an unexpected quarter, and is a man of approved skill. Nothing further is known of these three men. Meantime it has been suggested (Professor Dr. J. Murphy, of Belfast, ' Handbook to Chronicles ') that the first of the three was for Judah proper the second for that contingent of Judah that hailed from Dan and the Philistines; and the third for that of Simeon and the Arabs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Of Benjamin... armed men with bow and shield (see 2 Chronicles 14:8, and note thereunder).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - While Eliada of last verse was for Benjamin, Professor Dr. Murphy supposes that Jehozabad was for the annexed part of Ephraim. But no suppositions of this kind can avail to explain the numbers in the text, which is no doubt corrupt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles17:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - These waited; Hebrew, הַמְשָׁרְתִים, plur. piel part. of שָׁרַת. The verse states that this enormous fivefold army, with its five princes (counting, in our corrupt text, one million one hundred and sixty thousand), was the king's Jerusalem standing army, while other separate regiments or bands of troops were spread through all Judah, where they might be most needed for defence.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The purport of the verse is to let us into the secret that the riches and honour in abundance of Jehoshaphat were, in fact, the snare by which he was led to entangle himself with one who, probably only on that account, was willing to be entangled by affinity with him (2 Chronicles 21:6; 2 Chronicles 22:2-4; 2 Kings 8:25-29). It is not hard to see how they would both lead him, if not always out of big and patronizing thoughts, to seek and also lay him open to be sought. When this verse says Jehoshaphat joined affinity, etc., it means that he had done so. to wit, not fewer than nine years before, in promoting or allowing, whichever it was, the marriage of his son Jehoram with Ahab's and Jezebel's daughter Athaliah. For the issue of this marriage, Ahaziah, took the throne at the age of twenty-two years, thirteen years hence from this seventeenth year of his grandfather Jehoshaphat's reign, the year of Ahab's death. But as we are told that Ahaziah was the youngest son of Jehoram and Athaliah (for explanation of which see 2 Chronicles 21:17), the \"joining affinity\" must have been something earlier than nine years, and very probably came yet nearer the prosperity of the earlier years of Jehoshaphat's reign, with which would agree well the keynote touched again significantly here from our 2 Chronicles 17:5. Comp. 2 Kings 8:17, 26; 2 Chronicles 21:20; 2 Chronicles 22:2 (which needs the correction of twenty-two to forty-two). Although it is certain that the act of Jehoshaphat was wrong in principle, disastrous in practice (2 Chronicles 19:2, 3), and threatened fatal consequences to himself (2 Chronicles 18:31, 32), yet it is not impossible to suppose his motives were for the most part good, and he may naturally have thought that the sunshine of his own peace and abundance might be the set time to win influence in and over Israel, rather than strengthen Israel in its ungodly independence. On the other hand, nothing could justify Jehoshaphat risking such intimacy of relationship with such a family, heedless of consequences, looking towards idolatry, which he should have known were overwhelmingly probable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - After certain years he went down. In lieu of the italic type \"certain\" here, the English idiom, \"years after,\" would aptly reproduce the facts of the case. This journey to Samaria to see Ahab was made in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign (1 Kings 22:51; comp. 2 Chronicles 20:35 and 2 Kings 3:1). What were the precise antecedent circumstances of this visit of Jehoshaphat to Ahab it is interesting to surmise - whether it were the fruit of an invitation direct from Ahab, who had his own designs, or whether it were for diplomatic reasons, that worked in the mind of Jehoshaphat as well as of Ahab, in view of Syria. It is evident that Ahab promptly determined to improve this conference of kings. Persuaded him; i.e. he took steps to induce him. This is the uniform signification of the word here used in the eighteen times of its occurrence, and mostly in doubtful, or worse than doubtful, matter. The form is the hiph. of סוּת, in which conjugation only the verb occurs. The Revised Version renders \"moved.\" The visiting and cooperating of Jehoshaphat and Ahab made a novel departure in the history of the rended kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and continued till the time of Jehu. Ramoth-Gilead. This important city of Gad (Joshua 20:8; Joshua 21:38), in Palestine beyond Jordan, comes into question as one not surrendered to the king-dora of Israel in good faith, according to the promise of Benhadad (1 Kings 20:34; comp. 1, 4, 7, 11, 20, 30, 33), Benhadad's father having taken it from Omri, father of Ahab. For \"all the might that he showed,\" and presumably in conflicts with Syria, Omri was evidently a heavy loser. Ramoth-Gilead means \"the heights of Gilead.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I am as thou, etc. The same unqualified kind of language was used By Jehoshaphat on another occasion (2 Kings 3:7), two years later, when Jehoram, son of the deceased Ahab, also asked his help against Moab. Whether on the one occasion or the other, it is quite possible that Jehoshaphat thought he was serving common interests, and the cause of his own kingdom, as well as of Israel; nevertheless \"Jehu the son of Hanani the seer\" ignores the supposed justification (2 Chronicles 19:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The wording of this verse is identical with that of the parallel (1 Kings 22:5). Jehoshaphat, if even not quite conscious of it, is throwing some sop to his conscience in essaying to become, and posing as, the godly counsellor of \"the ungodly\" (2 Chronicles 19:2). At any rate, his counsel is right, even to the point of urging to-day, and significantly deprecating procrastination. It is not, however, so clear that he was, in the first instance, as decided in respect of the necessity of inquiring the will of the Lord at the mouth of a true prophet, in distinction from a prophet merely of Israel, though they should be \"four hundred\" in number! Compare the following two verses, however, which show as though he was holding himself quite prepared and on the look-out for the expected occasion of having to rein Ahab up!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - These four hundred prophets, as Keil justly notes, were not prophets of Ashe-rah, nor of Baal, but strictly of Israel, i.e. of the images of the calf (1 Kings 12:26-33). Their word speedily showed itself not the word of the Lord, but the word that was made up to order of the king, and to suit his known wish at any time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Revised Version well at-ranges the words of this verse, \"Is there not here besides a prophet of the Lord?\" The conscience of Ahab successfully made a coward of him, that he took so quietly this pronounced slight put on his kingdom s prophets (prophetae vitulorum) by his brother-king Jehoshaphat!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The same is Micaiah. This true prophet of the Lord is known only here in recorded history, but it is evident he was otherwise well known to his generation and to Ahab (ver. 25). The outspokenness of Ahab and the sustained courtesy of Jehoshaphat are alike agreeable to notice in this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The contents of this and the following two verses narrate either what had already taken place, or the continuation of the scene that had not come to its end, but had been interrupted in order to carry out fully the urgent exhortation of Jehoshaphat \"to-day,\" so that Ahab sent at once there and then a messenger for Micaiah. Any way, the unreal prophets have their full opportunity and their say at least twice over, as also Micaiah below (vers. 14, 16, 18-22, 27). A void place; i.e. a level floor; Revised Version, an open place. The Hebrew word designates often just a \"threshing-floor,\" גּרֶן; but quite possibly here, a recognized court at the gate of the city, used for judgment, is intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Zedekiah (named son of Chenaanah to distinguish him from some now unknown contemporary, or, perhaps, because the father was in some way distinguished) was one of those who knew the truth, nor feared to put it on his lips at the very time that his life. did not incorporate it (Deuteronomy 33:17). For other particulars of him, borrowed from the doubtfulness of Josephus, Bee Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1836. Had made him horns of iron. It would seem as though Zedekiah had made these \"horns of iron\" at some previous time, or, perhaps, now simulated some very rough presentation of horns of an impromptu kind. The horns were the symbol of power, and the iron of a power invincible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This verse bespeaks very clearly the rotten condition of Church and state, prophets and king and \"officers\" (ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This first reply of Micaiah, given in the latter haft of the verse, does not stand for untruth or deceit, but for very thinly veiled, very thinly disguised, very keen taunt and reproof. It has been well described as the ironical echo of the language of the unreal prophets. Micaiah begins by answering a fool according to his folly, i.e. according to his own heart's desire. He had just come from some place of imprisonment or punishment (ver. 25). And he so spoke or so looked that the king should know he had not spoken his last word in answer to the inquiry addressed to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The brief parable smote the very heart of Ahab (Numbers 27:17); and Ahab felt it, like \"the sentence of death\" in him; in a way all different, indeed, from that in which an apostle of many a century afterward felt it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Ahab's language in this verso shows that, though he had adjured Micaiah, he did not wish to seem to believe that he could speak anything but his own temper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Who shall entice, etc.? Hebrew piel future פָתָח. This and the following three verses must have told, manifestly did tell, with fearful force of faithful preaching, upon the unreal prophets and the wicked king. How it was that their contents did not avail with Jehoshaphat to throw full energy again into his conscience, and to enable him to break at once with Ahab and his expedition, is inexplicable (and the more as it was his own pressing suggestion that the true prophet should be summoned), except as another illustration of the fearful difficulty that lies so often to human weakness, in the way of retracing a false step. Both these visions (vers. 16, 18-22) well illustrate how God revealed his truth, will and specific messages to his true prophets in vision. The vision of the throne, grand in all the majesty of its simplicity, of the psalmists (9, 11, 45, 103.), of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1-5), of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:26), of Daniel (Daniel 7:9), of Stephen (Acts 7:56), of St. John (Revelation 4:2), is part of heaven's own stamp of authentication of the Bible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the LORD said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The vision culminating as regards its practical object in this verse is Micaiah's bold explanation of how it comes to pass that he has to boar the brunt of Ahab's \"hate,\" on account of the uniformly unfavourable character of his answers to him, instead of four hundred other men sharing it with him. He declares, on the authority of his rapt vision, that it is because they are possessed by a lying spirit (Romans 1:25, 28; 1 Thessalonians 2:12). And, like the true prophet of all time, he declares it at all hazards and at all cost.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee? This question of Zedekiah, and Micaiah's answer to him in the following verse, arc both obscure and of doubtful interpretation, but their drift not at all so. Keil and Bertheau correctly say, - in that Zedekiah used the force and the language that he did, it is not a bad sign that he was under a spirit's influence, but in that it was physical force which he used in a moral subject, this was a conclusive sign of the character of the spirit that he was amenable to. Among many possible suggestions as to the exact meaning of the question, \"Which way,\" etc.? it is possible that a sceptical taunt best explains Zedekiah's words, and that he meant that he did not believe the Spirit of the Lord went any way to Micaiah. He will not yield to a doubt or to a suspicion thrown upon it that the Spirit had been with himself, and he will fain throw great doubt, whether he had proceeded from him to Micaiah!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - So also, probably, this verse would purport to tell us beforehand distinctly what is not told after the issue of the battle and Ahab's death, that Zedekiah and his co-prophets did what they could, however vainly, to hide and to elude the vengeance of Jezebel (1 Kings 20:30; 1 Kings 22:25; 2 Kings 9:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Carry him back. The last of these three words tells, of course, its own tale, of what had already been the treatment accorded to Micaiah. Amon the governor... Joash the king's son. This latter person is found only here and in the parallel, and the designation given him probably does not intend a personal relationship to the king, but an official; so see again 2 Chronicles 28:7; and note the conjunction again of the governor of the house, in the next clause. The Vulgate translates the Hebrew for \"the king's,\" as though it were a proper name, \"Amelech.\" See also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' under the name \"Maaseiah\" 17. Nor is Amon the governor known elsewhere except in the parallel (1 Kings 22:26), but these designations, as through some chinks, throw a little scanty light into the subject of the internal administration at this time of the kingdom of Israel. In this kingdom subsequent to the separation, decentralization seems to have been carried to a further point than in Judah, and considering its greater extent, its far inferior metropolitan force, its double place of worship and sacrifice, these largely idolatrous, and in all this the undoubted degraded authority of its central government, this is very explainable. It is true that in both kingdoms history speaks equally of such offices and officers as were distinctly military or looked that way, but it can scarcely be without a reason that for the numerous allusions in Israel (1 Kings 16:8-10; 1 Kings 18:3; 1 Kings 20:7; 1 Kings 21:7-13; 2 Kings 1:8-17; 2 Kings 3:6; 2 Kings 10:5) to councils of elders (well known before the disruption), and governors of palaces, of cities, of houses, and of provinces, there is scarcely one in the records of Judah. Here possibly enough the executive would be more vigorous, more compact, and more direct and close in its action from headquarters, while in both divisions of what should have been the one kingdom, royalty was by profession constitutional, and in its devolution hereditary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Only the slightest differences are noticeable between this verse and the parallel, this latter using the sign of the objective case (which in this instance would probably lend some contemptuousness of expression), and using the word \"come\" instead of return.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The courage and fidelity of Micaiah, in not deserting either his prophet-message or his prophet-Master, are admirable, and for his determined appeal to all the people, which was made in the very face of the king or kings, see again Micah 1:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - It must remain doubtful which of the kings carried with him the uneasier heart. What Jehoshaphat might have gained in less element of personal and physical fear, he by rights should have lost in sensitiveness of conscience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Ahab does not seem disposed to lose anything again for want of asking, and even vouchsafing apparently (but it is exceedingly likely that this arises from our failing to appreciate exactly the force of the Hebrew forms in the text) to use the tone of directing, to his brother-king of the better part and kingdom. It must be presumed that there was something to relieve Ahab's language of the barefaced disregard for the safety of Jehoshaphat and regard for his own, which lie on the surface of the words he uses. Quite possibly, for instance, both knew that Ahab was to be the mark of the shooters. Also Ahab's disguise may have meant a heavy price to pay to his pride, while Jehoshaphat's dignity was saved intact. So, too, Ahab may have merely purported to say, \"You can, without any special risk, wear your royal apparel; but I,\" etc,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Our had commanded stands rendered in the parallel not so explicitly \"commanded,\" but in both cases the Hebrew text is the same (צִוָּה). Therefore, if the place of vers. 29, 30 were inverted, what reads like the cool suggestion of Ahab in ver. 29 would seem more tolerable. Mean. time, Benhadad's command argues the intensity of his resentment towards Ahab, and not less ungrateful forgetfulness for the ultimate consideration that Ahab had allowed to him (1 Kings 20:31-34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Comparing this and following verse minutely with the parallel (1 Kings 22:32, 33), the exact correspondence of the latter of each pair of verses only the more clearly points the significance belonging to the two clauses of foreign matter interposed so characteristically by the writer of Chronicles for his own unvarying special objects, viz. the Lord helped him; and God moved them. What the cry of Jehoshaphat was remains uncertain; whether a cry to his own bodyguard and soldiers, or a cry to those who were beginning \"to compass him about as bees,\" to let them know at any rate that he was not the king they sought, or whether most improbably, a cry to the Lord is meant. The cry fulfilled its purpose, and if Jehoshaphat had a sneaking love for Ahab (see the significant \"love them,\" etc., of Jehu in second verse of next chapter), he evidently had not any idea of needlessly dying for him. The happy distinction of perceiving in next verse, as compared with seeing in this verse, is not warranted by the Hebrew text (in both cases כִּרְאות), though it is by the gist of the connection and English idiom,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - At a venture; Hebrew, לְתֻמּו; i.e. \"in his innocence.\" The root is the familiar root expressive of uprightness, perfectness, simplicity, and the meaning here is that the shooter was innocent of what a distinguished deed he was doing, of the personality of the man at whom he aimed (for it is not necessary to suppose his shot was quite at random), and of the skill that gave the arrow to reach its ultimate destiny. Between the joints of the harness; literally, between the joints and the harness, i.e. that part called the breastplate. The arrow went through, or by the side of one of the actual articulations of the armour-mail worn. Ahab's direction to the chariot-driver at the spur of the first wounded moment to turn and carry him out of the host, was evidently qualified, when he found that the wound was not immediately fatal. As the heat of the battle grew, and victory did not at once turn one way or the other, he was the more anxious to give the moral support of his presence to the last to his army, and, unable to stand by himself, he was supported by his own orders (so our rendering is not inconsistent with that in the parallel \"was stayed\" (1 Kings 22:35) in the chariot till he died in the evening. Although the spirit of Ahab, and his fidelity to his own army, kingdom, and self, cannot but appear to advantage in these last incidents of his unworthy life, yet it is probable that they find their record here for the sake of giving clear statement to the fact, that in the chariot his life-bleed collected according to the saying of the parallel (ver. 35 compared with ver. 38). Note, therefore, particularly the truncated history of the writer of Chronicles in this instance. He, no doubt, consciously omitted, and with a purpose, his own usual purpose; but light is lost, and the cross light tends rather to misleading, except for that only correct user of Scripture, which teaches us to compare one Scripture with another, and balance one part against another - a thing easy to do in matters of fact, but too often forgotten in the weightier matter of doctrine. Here our eighteenth chapter closes, less the mention of the proclamation for the self-disbanding of Ahab's army (ver. 36 of the parallel chapter) which should fulfil the prophecy of our ver. 16, and less any mention of Ahab's burial, of the washing of his chariot in the pool of Samaria, of the dogs licking up of the blood there, and of his ivory house, etc. (vers. 37-40 of the parallel chapter). All of which omittings accord well with the one clear ecclesiastical and religious intent of the Chronicles, in place of the pursuit of matters of general and merely graphic historic interest, however charged with instruction they too might be.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles18:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.VERSEENDNEWLINE","2Chr.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In peace. Compare the use of the phrase in vers. 16 and 26, 27 of last chapter. The only peace in which it could be reasonably supposed Jehoshaphat returned to his house and the metropolis was that of freedom from war, and of present \"assurance of his life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. For Hanani, the faithful father of a faithful son, see 2 Chronicles 16:7-10, where we read that he \"came to Asa King of Judah,\" etc. Also for Jehu, see 1 Kings 16:1-4, where we read of his commission at the word of the Lord to rebuke Baasha the King of Israel, at a date upwards of thirty years before the present; and see 2 Chronicles 20:34, which would lead us to infer, though not with certainty, that he outlived Jehoshaphat. The book called by his name, however, was not necessarily finished by him. It is evident that neither the word of the Lord nor the messengers and prophets of the Lord were bound by the orthodox limits of the divided kingdom. The powerful character and the moral force of the true prophet is again seen (comp. 2 Chronicles 15:1-8) in the way in which he was wont to go out to meet the evil-doer, though he were a king. We are accustomed to set the whole of this down to the account of the special inspiration of the prophet of old; yet that was but typical of the intrinsic force that truth faithfully spoken should wield in its own right in later times. Religion is established in the nation and people that know and do this, by the accredited teachers of it, vie. the plain rebuke of the wrong. Shouldest thou... love them that hate the Lord? Strong suspicion must attend upon Jehoshaphat, that he had been not a little misled by answering to some personal fascination in Ahab. The prophet's rebuke is not that Jehoshaphat helped both Israel and therein Judah also against a common foe, but that he helped the ungodly, etc. Therefore wrath upon thee, etc. The significance of this sentence was probably not merely retrospective, glancing at the fact that Jehoshaphat returned to Jerusalem minus the victory for which he had bid, but was probably an intimation of troubles that should ripen, were already ripening for Jehoshaphat, in the coming invasion of his own kingdom (2 Chronicles 20:1-3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Nevertheless; Hebrew, אֲכָל one of the few particles that were affirmative in the earlier Hebrew (Genesis 42:21), but adversative in the later (2 Chronicles 1:4; Daniel 10:7, 21). It may be well rendered, \"on the other hand.\" The expression here recalls the less favourable \"notwithstanding\" of Revelation 2:20. There are good things found in thee (see 2 Chronicles 17:1-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - From Beershsba to Mount Ephraim. The length of the good land is not to be quoted, as of old, the undivided \"Dan to Beersheba,\" but Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (2 Chronicles 13:16-19). Jehoshaphat makes another conscientious and vigorous endeavour to reform his own kingdom, to keep it steadfast in the worship of God, and free from idolatry. It is to be noticed that he does not turn away his ear from the rebuke which had been given him, but turns his heart to it. As it does not appear that he broke with Israel and Israel's kings (2 Chronicles 20:35, 37; 2 Kings 3:7, 14, 24), it is possible, especially in view of ver. 37 in our ch. 20, that the severity of the Divine rebuke was understood to apply to the occasions which found Jehoshaphat in alliance with a king notably bad, and for some supposed chance of advantage to himself. This last element of consideration will difference sufficiently the two cases just cited, to wit, the case in which Jehoshaphat joined himself with Azariah, and is sternly \"prophesied against,\" and that in which he helped Jehoram, and through Elisha's intervention gained him the day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Judges... fenced cities. Jehoshaphat proceeds from direct religious reforms to that which is of importance only second in the life of a nation - reform in the matter of civil administration of justice. The skeleton here given of what should be the character of a judge, and why, harmonizes well with the uniform stress laid in Scripture upon \"justice and judgment.\" It is hard indeed to see, rather impossible, upon what foundation a sure structure of civil growth and stability can be laid, except on that of positive religion. Note the positions and the succinct arguments of vers. 6, 7; and how unequivocally they are based upon faith in a personal God, and upon his revealed character. It can scarcely be that this was the first time of judges being set in the cities of Judah but possibly the meaning intended to be conveyed with emphasis is, that now, looking well round his kingdom, he took care that all the cities should be properly provided with the necessary judges, while of late some had been, and some had not, and some, though they had been officered with judges, had found them not what judges ought to be. The immense majority of the \"six thousand\" Levite \"officers and judges\" of David's regulation (1 Chronicles 23:4; 36:29) had, with their superiors, kings and prophets, gone astray. With our present passage may be compared Deuteronomy 16:18-20, where the original enactment of judges and officers is narrated. Fenced cities. Hebrew for \"fenced,\" בְּצֻרות; kal passive part. plur. The word occurs twenty-six times from the Book of Numbers to the Book of the Prophet Zechariah, and is rendered in the Authorized Version \"fenced\" or \"defenced\" twenty-two times, \"walled\" twice, \"strong\" once, and \"mighty\" once. The \"gates\" of the original institution in Deuteronomy are now (probably still the gates of) fenced cities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - The statement of the Divine principles laid down in these verses for the foundations of the \"kingdom of heaven\" on earth, and the doing of God's \"will on earth, even as it is in heaven,\" stretch from Moses and Job (Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 1:17; Deuteronomy 10:17; Deuteronomy 16:19; Job 34:19) to SS.

Of course every father was head of his own family, but only one (such as in modern times by primogeniture the eldest son) the representative head of the entire family, and under this expression is no doubt naturally set forth only those families that were of some relative consideration or distinction. For the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies. Considering the plainer distinction in the language of vex. 11, there can be no doubt that the words, \"for the judgment of the Lord,\" do not intend simply to describe godly judgment, but point to dues payable to the Lord in some religious aspect: \"Render to Caesar... and to God the things that are God's\" (Matthew 22:21; Mark 12:17; Luke 20:25); while the words, \"and for controversies,\" point to the mutual strifes of the people. When they returned; Hebrew, \"and they returned.\" It has been proposed to remove this clause so as to begin the next verse with it (and so the Revised Version shows as a clause by itself, \"And they returned to Jerusalem\"), and, to make this fit the better, the word did in the first line of the verse is changed into \"had.\" It is, however, possible to render the clause, \"And they dwelt in Jerusalem,' which would make a far mere coherent sense, and would mark the permanence and stationariness of this chief court.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Come... of your brethren... in their cities. These words confirm our foregoing note, and point to the appeal character of the Jerusalem court. Note also the clear connection of the verse with Deuteronomy 17:8, 10, 11; Exodus 21:12-27. Law ... commandment, statutes... judgments. It might sometimes need to be shown how the particular commandment flowed from main and essential law; and the written statute is easily distinguishable from those judgments, which were more like \"judge-made\" law. Ye shall not trespass; Revised Version, more correctly, ye shall not be guilty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.

This expression, or one very closely resembling it, is frequently found both in Chronicles and elsewhere, so far as the English Version is concerned. But the verb in its present form (hithp. conjugation) is found in Chronicles, omitting other books, just fifteen times, and rarely, if ever, to the level of the mere passive voice. It carries rather the idea of a person who exerts himself, and does all that in him lies to nerve himself with strength for any object (1 Chronicles 11:10; 1 Chronicles 19:13; 2 Chronicles 12:13; 2 Chronicles 13:7, 8, 21; 2 Chronicles 15:8; 2 Chronicles 16:9; 2 Chronicles 17:1; 2 Chronicles 21:4; 2 Chronicles 23:1; 2 Chronicles 25:11; 2 Chronicles 27:6; 2 Chronicles 32:5). It may suggest to us that Solomon threw the force of moral energy and resolution into his work and life at this period. The Lord his God was with him; i.e. Jehovah his God was with him. The parallels of this very simple and natural expression are too numerous for quotation. Some of the earliest are found in well-known connections in the Book of Genesis, as e.g. Genesis 21:22; 26:28; 28:15, 20; 31:3. Again, Numbers 14:14, 43; Numbers 23:21; Joshua 14:12; Judges 6:13; Ruth 2:4; 1 Samuel 17:37; 2 Samuel 5:10; 1 Chronicles 11:9; 1 Chronicles 22:11, 16; 2 Chronicles 15:9; 2 Chronicles 19:11; 2 Chronicles 36:23; Amos 5:14. The beautiful New Testament equivalent occurs in 2 Thessalonians 3:16, and elsewhere. Like some other of those earliest concisest religious expressions, brevity and simplicity are fully charged with suggestion. And the above quotations will be found to furnish examples of the manifold practical use of the Lord's presence with any one. That presence may infer the help just of companionship, or of sure sympathy, or of needed counsel, or of strength in the hour of temptation, or of absolute practical help, or of the highest revealings of faith. The whole circle of need, of human and Christian need, the Divine presence \"will supply\" (Philippians 4:19). The \"need\" of Solomon in his present position was patent and pressing. Would that he had always kept by the true supply of it! Magnified him exceedingly. This verb in its piel conjugation, signifying \"to make grow,\" occurs twenty-six times in the various books of the Old Testament, some of the more characteristic occurrences of it being found in the following passages: Genesis 12:2; Numbers 6:5; Joshua 3:7; Joshua 4:17; 1 Kings 1:37, 47; 2 Kings 10:6; 1 Chronicles 29:12, 25; Esther 3:1; Job 7:17; Psalm 34:4; Psalm 69:31; Isaiah 1:2; Isaiah 44:14; Ezekiel 31:4; Daniel 1:5; Hosea 9:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This verse and the following four supersede the one verse, 1 Kings 3:4; and the five together give us, of course, a much fuller view of the events of the sacrifice. Our present verse purports to show the representative components of \"all Israel\" in a fourfold classification. Captains of thousands and of hundreds (see first 1 Chronicles 13:1; 1 Chronicles 27:1; 1 Chronicles 28:1; and then Exodus 18:21, 25; Numbers 31:14, 48, 52, 54; Deuteronomy 1:15; 1 Samuel 8:12; 1 Samuel 17:18; 1 Samuel 18:13; 1 Samuel 22:7; 2 Samuel 18:1; 2 Kings 11:9, 15, 19). The judges. The office and the person of the judge were held in high honour among the Jewish people from the first, and perhaps, also, with a noteworthy uniformity, even in the more degenerate periods of their history. Their commencement in patriarchal simplicity can be easily imagined, and receives illustration from such passages as Job 29:7, 8, 9; Job 32:9. Their more formal development may be considered to date from the crisis related in Exodus 18:14-24. And the allusions to the judge and his office thenceforward sustain our impression of the honour in which they were held, arising, no doubt, largely from the deep-felt necessity for them, the more society crystallized (Numbers 25:5; Deuteronomy 16:18; Deuteronomy 19:17; Deuteronomy 21:2; Joshua 8:33; 1 Chronicles 23:24; 1 Chronicles 26:29; 2 Chronicles 19:8-10). In 1 Chronicles 23:24 we are told how David set apart \"six thousand Levites\" to be \"officers and judges.\" Every governor. The word employed here (נָשִׂיא) is rendered by five different words in our Authorized Version: \"prince\" (Genesis 17:20, passim), \"ruler\" (Exodus 16:22, passim), \"captain\" (Numbers 2:3, passim), \"chief\" Numbers 3:24, passim), and \"governor\" in the present passage only. It is evidently a term of generic signification, used of a king (1 Kings 11:34; Ezekiel 12:10); of leaders of the Ishmaelites (Genesis 17:20); of the captains of the tribes of Israel (Numbers 7:11); of the chiefs of families (Numbers 3:24); while the use of it (Genesis 23:6) to set forth the position of Abraham as one raised to eminence so high and undisputed that it might be clearly said to be God's doing, is sufficient to determine its central signification. The chief of the fathers; i.e. the heads of the fathers. The first occurrence of the expression, \"the heads of their fathers' houses\" (Exodus 6:14), and of \"the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families\" (Exodus 6:25), sufficiently explains the original and perfectly natural meaning of the phrase. The great importance and significance of the position of the heads \"of families\" and \"of houses\" and\" of fathers\" in early patriarchal times must necessarily have declined by the time of Solomon, when the nation had received so much more of civil form and system. But the name remained, and the family and social position did not fail to make themselves felt, and finally the official recognition of them in David's time is evidenced by 1 Chronicles 27:1, and in Solomon's time both by the present passage and 2 Chronicles 5:2 with its parallel 1 Kings 8:1. Our present use of the expression ought probably to show it, in close apposition with the foregoing words, \"to all Israel\" (wrongly translated \"in all Israel\" in the Authorized Version), and which itself is a repetition of the \"to all Israel\" in the beginning of the verse. Although the existing Hebrew pointing of the verse does not favour the supposition, it may be that the writer means to emphasize Solomon's summons as made both to the kingdom as such, and to the people also as a united people. We are not, indeed, told here, in so many words, what it was that Solomon said \"to all Israel.\" But there can be no doubt as to his object, as betrayed in the first clause of the following verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All the congregation; i.e. in the persons of their captains, judges, princes, and family representatives. The high place... at Gibeon. It may readily be allowed that even nature and instinct would suggest a certain fitness in selecting high places, and the impressive grandeur of groves, for the worship of the High and Lofty One and for the offerings of sacrifice to him. It was not otherwise historically (Genesis 12:7, 8; Genesis 22:3, 4; Genesis 31:54). However, first, it was part of the education of a nation (situated in the heart of the young world) in the unity of the one God, that its worship should be offered in one place, and the smoke of its sacrifices ascend from one altar; and secondly, it was not difficult to foresee that the very force that lay in the associations, which dictated the choice of some places (not least, certainly, \"the grove\"), would constitute their weakness and snare. The prohibitions, therefore, of the Mosaic Law (Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26), witnessed to by such corroborations as are found in commands to obliterate certain Canaanitish traces, that looked long time a different way (Leviticus 17:8; Leviticus 26:30; Numbers 33:52; Deuteronomy 33:29; Joshua 22:29; 1 Kings 20:23), approve themselves as in thorough harmony with what all would feel to be the genius of the religious education of Israel, and, through Israel, of the nations of the world. The wonder that impresses us is rather that means were not found to abide by the \"letter\" of the Law to a far greater degree during all the generations that elapsed before the people were settled in their land, and were gathered in their temple so typical. Is it not possible to regard this as an impressive instance of how, even in a system that sought to be of the closest and most exclusive, the \"spirit,\" by force of circumstances, resented the tyrannous bondage of the \"letter\"? Anyway, for ages from the time of that prohibition, the nation had the moral principle as their guide rather than any possibility of keeping safe within a commandment's \"letter\" (so see Judges 6:25, 26; Judges 13:17-24; 1 Samuel 7:10; 1 Samuel 13:9; 1 Samuel 16:5; 1 Samuel 10:5; 1 Chronicles 21:26; 1 Kings 18:30). Even now, accordingly, the prohibited is still the observed, and by Solomon, too, in the steps of David, even if it be necessary to describe it as the \"winked at.\" And to the \"high place\" at Gibeon Solomon and all the representatives, the congregation of Israel, have to repair in order to do sacrifice. The tabernacle was now at Gibeon, whither it had come from Nob (1 Chronicles 16:39, 40; 1 Samuel 21:1, 6; from which latter reference, speaking of the \"shew-bread,\" it comes that we know the tabernacle to have resided at Nob awhile; for the circumstance is not positively narrated in any passage of the history (but see also 1 Samuel 22:9, 11). Gibeon was one of the four Hivite cities, the other three being Beeroth, Chephirah, and Kirjath-jearim. It had its first fame from its \"wiliness\" (Joshua 9:3, 4, etc.). By the directest road, it was five miles distant from Jerusalem, in the direction of the sea. It was further noted for the encounter between Joab and Abner (2 Samuel 2:12-17). Again, for the slaying of Amasa by Joab (2 Samuel 20:6-10), and for the death of Joab himself at the hand of Benalak, at the very horns of the altar (1 Kings 2:28-34). Although the exact date of the lodging of the tabernacle at Gibeon is not told us, nor even the person who was answerable for briging it there, yet there can be no reasonable doubt that it was David, as we read (1 Chronicles 16:40) of his appointing the priests to offer \"the daily sacrifices\" there, on the brazen altar of Moses, when Zadok was at their head, and Heman and Jeduthun were their resident musicians. In what particular part of Gibeon or of its immediate neighbourhood the tabernacle was stationed cannot be said with any certainty. Amid a considerable choice of likely places, one forming part of Gibeon itself, and just south of El-Tib, seems the likeliest, and to be preferred to the suggestion of Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 216), of Neby-Samuil, which is a mile distant. The present imposing occasion is the last of any importance on which Gibeon is brought before us (see also 1 Kings 8:3; 1 Chronicles 9:35). There was the tabernacle. The removal of the tabernacle to Gibeon no doubt followed immediately on the destruction of Nob by Saul (1 Samuel 22:9; 1 Chronicles 16:39, 40, compared with 37; 21:28, 29). Moses... made in the wilderness (see Exodus 25, 26, 27, 33:7-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But the ark. Again, as in 1 Chronicles 16:39, the writer emphasizes the fact of the temporary divorce that had obtained between the ark and the tabernacle (so 1 Samuel 6:20; 2 Samuel 6:2-19; 1 Kings 3:2, 4, 15; 1 Chronicles 13:3-14; 1 Chronicles 15:1-3, 12-15, 23-29). David's pitching of the tent for it is recorded emphatically 1 Chronicles 15:1; 1 Chronicles 16:1; 2 Samuel 6:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The brazen altar. This statement is introduced to lay stress on the fact that, though the ark indeed was not with the tabernacle, the brazen altar of burnt offering assuredly was there, this constituting the place, the proper spot, for sacrifice and worship. (For the account of the brazen altar and its making, see Exodus 27:1-8; Exodus 38:1-7; also Numbers 16:38, 39.) This altar of burnt offering is often spoken of as the altar, to distinguish it from the altar of incense (Exodus 30:1; Exodus 39:38; Numbers 4:11). Bezaleel. (For detailed genealogy, see our 1 Chronicles 2:3-20; also Exodus 31:2-5; Exodus 35:30-35.) He put before. The reading (שָׁם), \"was there before,\" is to be preferred, tallying as it does exactly with Exodus 40:6. This was the reading understood by the Septuagint and Vulgate. The majority of manuscripts, however, and the Syriac Version, have שָׂם. Sought unto it. The analogy of the use of this word would make to be preferred the translation \"sought him,\" i.e. the \"Jehovah\" just spoken cf. But whether the object of the verb be in this place Jehovah or the altar, it would seem probable that the clause purports to say that Solomon and his people were accustomed to repair thither, while now they were about to repair thither with a very vast burnt offering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A thousand burnt offerings. The first instance of the burnt offering is Genesis 8:20, and thereafter in the same book Genesis 15:9, 17; Genesis 22:2, 7, 13. It was manifestly the chiefest of the eucharistic kind of sacrifices, and for manifest reasons also was preceded by a \"sin\" offering (Exodus 29:36-38; Leviticus 8:14, etc.). (For full details of the ceremonial, sac Leviticus 1, 6, 7, 8, passim) The extraordinary number of the burnt offerings on this and some similar occasions may well excite our wonder (Numbers 7:3, 17; 1 Kings 8:64; 2 Chronicles 4:1 compared with 2 Chronicles 7:7. See also Herod., 'Hist.,' 7:43). The priests, of course, performed the sacrifices at the command of Solomon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-12. - The vision and prayer of Solomon, and God's answer to that prayer. (Comp. 1 Kings 3:5-15; 1 Kings 9:2.) Verse 7. - That night. This can mean no other night than that which followed the day (or the days) of sacrifices so multitudinous. The parallel account in 1 Kings 3:5 tells us the way in which \"God appeared to Solomon,\" viz. by dream. The words of God's offer, Ask what I shall give thee, are identical in the parallel place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father. These also are the exact words found in the parallel place, but they omit the words, \"thy servant,\" before \"David,\" found there. And hast made me to reign in his stead. This concise expression takes the place of two equivalent expressions, found at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh verses in the parallel passage, the former of which passages also describes it as \"this great kindness,\" i.e. kindness on the part of God - a description very much in harmony with David's own grateful acknowledgment to God (1 Kings 1:48). Up to this point our present account differs from its parallel in cutting out Solomon's eulogy of his father (\"According as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee\"), and his humbler disparagement of himself (\"And I, a little child, know not how to go out or come in\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established. This challenge on the part of Solomon, intended, without doubt, most reverently, is not given in the parallel place, and forms not only a distinctive but an interesting additional feature of the present account. It is thought by some that the \"promise \"here challenged is not very distinctly recorded anywhere, but surely passages like 1 Chronicles 17:12-14; 1 Chronicles 22:10; 1 Chronicles 28:6, 7 amply meet the case. See also 2 Samuel 7:12, 15. King over a people like the dust. It is noteworthy that, though the equivalent of this phrase is found in the parallel, the distinctiveness of this simile is not found there. (For the use of the simile to express a vast number, see Genesis 28:14; Numbers 23:10; Zephaniah 1:17; Zechariah 9:3.) It is not at all of frequent use in Scripture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Give me now wisdom and knowledge. The force of the opening of this verse, and the relation of it to the former, are both prejudiced by the \"now\" (עַתּה) being deposed from its right position as the first word in the verse. For the rest of this verse, the parallel passage has \"an understanding heart\" in place of our \"wisdom and knowledge;\" and \"that I may discern between good and bad,\" in place of our that I may go out and come in before this people. In using the words, \"wisdom and knowledge,\" Solomon seems to have remembered well the prayer of his father (1 Chronicles 22:12). (For the pedigree of the simple and effective phrase, \"know how to go out and come in,\" see Numbers 27:17; Deuteronomy 31:2; 1 Samuel 18:13, 16; 2 Samuel 3:25). It is at the same time refreshing to revisit the times when the most exalted nominal ruler was also the real ruler, as being the leader, the judge, the teacher in the highest sense, and \"the feeder\" of his people. Nor is it less refreshing to notice how, in Israel at least, the fact was so well recognized and honoured, that justice and to judge just judgment lay at the deepest foundation of civil society.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - With this verse the answer to Solomon's prayer begins. It is here concisely given in two verses, but occupies five (vers. 10-14) in the parallel place, including the verse not found here, which says, \"The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.\" Otherwise there is no essential difference of any importance, though it may be noted that the parallel gives voice to the promise of \"length of days,\" on the condition of Solomon fulfilling his part in showing obedience to the Divine will, and in following the steps of his father. Riches, wealth (עשֶׁרנְכָסִים). The most elementary idea of the former of these two words seems to be \"straight growth,\" \"prosperity;\" of the latter, \"to gather together\" or \"heap up.\" The former is found first in Genesis 31:16; and in the verb (hiph. conjugation) in Genesis 14:23. Afterwards it is found in almost all of the historical books, in the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and in the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel. The latter word occurs only five times (Joshua 22:8; in this and the following verses; and in Ecclesiastes 5:19; Ecclesiastes 6:2). Its Chaldee form is also found in Ezra 6:8 and Ezra 7:26. A comparison of these passages scarcely sustains the supposition of some, suggested by the derivation of the word, that it marks specially those stores of useful things which constituted largely the wealth of Old Testament times. Wisdom and knowledge. The distinction between these is evident, as also that they are needful complements of one another for the forming of a catholic, useful, sound character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Such as none of the kings... before thee, neither... after thee. These words were sadly ominous of the short-lived glory of the kingdom Only two kings had reigned before Solomon in Israel, and the glory of the kingdom too surely culminated in his reign, and even before the end of it (2 Chronicles 9:22, 23; 1 Chronicles 29:25; Ecclesiastes 2:9). On the other hand, the gratuitous and spontaneous fulness of promise in the Divine reply to a human prayer that \"pleased\" the Being invoked is most noticeable, and preached beforehand indeed, the lesson of the life of Jesus, \"Seek ye first the kingdom... and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matthew 6:33). The contents of this verse are followed in the parallel by the words,\" And Solomon awoke; and behold it was a dream.\" There can be no doubt that what is here rehearsed did not lose any force or anything of reality from its transpiring in a dream, of which the abundantly open statement of the method of it, as in \"sleep,\" and in \"a dream,\" may be accepted as the first cogent evidence. But beside this, the frequent recital in the Old Testament of occasions when significant and weighty matters of business import were so conducted by the Divine will forms ample ground and defence for the other class of occasions, of which more spiritual matter was the subject (Genesis 28:12; Genesis 41:7; Genesis 20:3; Genesis 31:10, 24; Genesis 37:5; Genesis 40:5; Genesis 41:32; Judges . 7:15; Job 33:15; Daniel 2:3; Daniel 7:1; Matthew 1:20; Matthew 2:13, 22; Matthew 27:19). On the other hand, side by side with such passages are those that refer to dreams for their emptiness and transiency of impression, when similes of this kind of thing are required (Job 20:8; Psalm 73:20; Psalm 126:1). This is not the place to enter into any argument of a metaphysical or physiological character respecting dreams, and what they may or may not avail. But as some persons know even too well how dreams have brought them most vivid, most torturing, and most exquisite experiences in turn, there will seem, to them at least, the less difficulty in admitting utterly their availableness for communications of highest import, not only from God to man, but under certain conditions from man to God. Without doubt, certain disabilities (and those, perhaps, more especially of the moral kind) attach to our mind in dreams. But do not dreams also find the scene of the keener activities of mind pure? Granted that the mind is then under ordinary circumstances without a certain control and self-commanding power, yet is it also in some large respects much more at liberty from that besetting tyranny of sense with which waking hours are so familiar! Hence its consummate daring and swiftness and versatility in dream beyond all that it knows in the body's waking state.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Solomon's return after sacrifice from Gibeon to Jerusalem, and from \"before the tabernacle of the congregation\" to \"before the ark of the covenant of the Lord\" in Mount Zion. (1 Kings 3:15) This verse not merely bears the trace of a slightly corrupt text in the presence of the Hebrew preposition: before בָּמָה, where there can be no doubt the preposition ְ should stand, but also suggests (keeping in view our ver. 3, and comparing 1 Kings 3:15) the condensed and cut-down method of Chronicles, and its strong preferences for selecting out of the various material at its command. The tabernacle of the congregation. This styling of the \"tabernacle\" is of very frequent occurrence. It is found above thirty times in Exodus, and fully as often in Leviticus and Numbers. Afterwards it is sprinkled more rarely in the historical books. The reason of its being styled \"the tabernacle of the congregation\" (מועֵר) is doubtful - perhaps because of the gatherings of the people in front of it, or possibly because of its being the place where God would meet with Moses. The other name, the tabernacle of \"witness\" or \"testimony\" or covenant\" (עֵדוּת; Numbers 9:15, etc.), is not unfrequent. Hence the LXX. σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου; the Vulgate, tabernaculum testimonii; and Luther's Stifisuitten. This verse very much stints the information contained in the parallel, to the effect that Solomon forthwith took his place before the ark of the covenant in Mount Zion, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and gave a feast to all his servants (2 Samuel 6:17-19; 1 Chronicles 16:1-3; Deuteronomy 14:26-29). And he reigned over Israel. These words seem nugatory both in themselves and as placed here. They probably stand for 1 Kings 4:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-17. - The attraction to Jerusalem of the signs of wealth - chariots, horses, etc. - on the part of Solomon. The excitement attending the great sacrifices at Gibeon, and before the ark in Jerusalem, had now subsided. And we obtain just a glimpse of the range of thought and purpose present to the mind of the reigning king. The largo expenditure of money would infer without fail the show of brilliant prosperity in the grand city for the time. Whether this would last, and whether it would not infer oppressive taxation somewhere or other (1 Kings 9:15, 21, 22; 1 Kings 10:25) among the people, time would show. Had this expenditure been all to record, none could suppose the commencing of the practical part of the king's reign either sound or auspicious. But, of course, it is to be qualified by other things that were transpiring, with which the parallel acquaints us (e.g. 1 Kings 3:16-28), only in different order. We now, however, begin a rapid and self-contained sketch of the reign of Solomon to his very death (ch. 9.) - the sketch one of marked characteristics, and in consistent keeping with the presumable objects of this work. For it is very much monopolized by the account of the temple. Verse 14. - The contents of this and the following three verses are identical with the parrallel 1 Kings 10:26-29, except that the words, \"and gold,\" of our ver. 15 (2 Chronicles 9:20) are not found there. The position of these four verses in the parallel, towards the close of the account of Solomon, would seem more natural than their position here, which has somewhat the appearance of a fragment interpolated, as on the other hand the account of the harlot-mothers there. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. The chariot was no institution of Israel (so Deuteronomy 20:1), neither of their earliest ancestors, nor of those more proximate. The earliest occasions of the mention of it (Genesis 41:43; Genesis 46:29; Genesis 50:9) are in connection with Egypt, and almost all subsequent occasions for a long stretch of time show it in connection with some foreign nation, till we read (2 Samuel 8:4; 1 Chronicles 18:4) of David \"reserving horses\" unhoughed \"for a hundred chariots,\" apparently also \"reserved\" out of the very much larger number which he had taken in battle from Hadadezer King of Zobah. The very genius of the character of God's people, a pilgrim-genius, as well as their long-time pilgrim-life, quite accounts for the \"chariot,\" though it be a war-chariot, having never ranked among their treasures (Deuteronomy 17:16; 1 Samuel 8:11). Now, however, Solomon thinks it the time to make it a feature of the nation's power and splendour. He gives the large order for fourteen hundred chariots apparently to Egypt (ver. 17; also ch. 9:28), the appropriate number of horses to which would be probably four thousand (2 Chronicles 9:25; comp. 1 Kings 4:26, where note the corrupt numeral forty thousand, 10:26). Solomon's fourteen hundred chariots were probably intended to exceed the numbers of the Egyptian king (2 Chronicles 12:3; comp. 2 Chronicles 14:6), of Hadadezer's (2 Samuel 8:4; 1 Chronicles 18:4), and of the Syrians (2 Samuel 10:18). But, on the other hand, see 1 Samuel 13:5 and 1 Chronicles 19:7, unless, as seems very probable, the numerals in these places are again incorrect. Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible' contains an interesting article on the chariot (vol. 1:295). For significant allusions to the horsemen, reference may be made to 1 Samuel 8:11; 1 Kings 20:20; 2 Kings 2:12; Isaiah 21:7. Twelve thousand horsemen. These probably purport what we should call horse-soldiers, or cavalry. And. it is likely that they come to designate these in virtue of the Hebrew word here used (פָרָשִׁים) meaning horses of the cavalry sort (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub voce). The chariot cities. In 2 Chronicles 8:5, 6 we are expressly told that Solomon \"built\" purposely these cities, for the chariots and for the horsemen, just as he built the \"store\" cities (see also 1 Kings 9:17-19; Xenoph., 'Anab.,' 1:4. § 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And gold. The omission of these words in the parallel (1 Kings 10:27) is remarkable in the light of what we read in 2 Chronicles 9:20. We find the contents of this verse again in 2 Chronicles 9:27; as also in the parallel (1 Kings 10:27), just quoted with the exception already named. Cedar trees. The meaning is felled trunks of cedar (1 Chronicles 22:4) (אֲרָזִים). Whether the wood intended is the cedar of Lebanon (Pinus cedrus, or Cedrus conifera), \"tall\" (Isaiah 2:13; Isaiah 37:24; Amos 2:9), \"widespreading\" (Ezekiel 31:3), odoriferous, with very few knots, and wonderfully resisting decay, is considered by authorities on such subjects still uncertain. Gesenius, in his 'Lexicon,' sub voc., may be consulted, and the various Bible dictionaries, especially Dr. Smith's, under \"Cedar;\" and Dr. Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' under \"Eres.\" The writer in Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary' suggests that under the one word \"cedar,\" the Pinus cedrus, Pinus deodara, Yew, Taxus baccata, and Pinus sylvestris (Scotch pine) were referred to popularly, and were employed when building purposes are in question. That the said variety was employed is likely enough, but that we are intended to understand this when the word \"cedar\" is used seems unlikely (see for further indication of this unlikeliness, the instancing of \"firs\" occasionally with \"cedars,\" 1 Kings 5:10; 1 Kings 9:11; 2 Chronicles 2:8). Sycomore trees (שִׁקְמִים). This word is found always in its present masc. plur. form except once, Psalm 78:47, where the plur. fem. form is found. The Greek equivalent in the Septuagint is always συκάμινος; but in the New Testament, and in the same treatise, i.e. the Gospel according to St. Luke, we find both συκάμινος and συκομωρέα (Luke 17:6 and Luke 19:4 respectively). Now, the former of these trees is the well. known mulberry tree. But the latter is what is called the fig-mulberry, or the sycamore-fig; and this is the tree of the Old Testament. Its fruit resembles the fig, grows on sprigs shooting out of the thick stems themselves of the tree, and each fruit needs to be punctured a few days before gathering, if it is to be acceptable eating (Amos 7:14; Isaiah 9:10). In the vale; i.e. in the lowland country, called the Shefelah. This is the middle one of the three divisions in which Judaea is sometimes described - mountain, lowland, and valley. This lowland was really the lowhills, between mountains and plain, near Lydda and Daroma (the \"dry,\" 1.q. Negeb, Deuteronomy 34:13), while the valley was the valley of Jordan, from Jericho to Engedi (Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' pp. 302, 309, 2nd edit.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Horses brought.., out of Egypt. Later on we read that horses were imported from other countries as well (2 Chronicles 9:24, 28), as, for instance, from Arabia and Armenia (Ezekiel 27:14). Linen yarn. The words are without doubt wrong here. But it is impossible to say with any certainty what should be in their place. The Vulgate shows here from Coa, presumably meaning Tekoa, a small place on the road from Egypt to Jerusalem. It might not have been easy to surmise, however, so much as this, but for the fact that the Septuagint shows in the parallel place, \"And from Tekoa\" (Amos 1:1). The Septuagint, however, has for the present place, Καὶ ἡ τιμὴ τῶν ἐμπόρωντοῦ βασίλεως πορεύεσθαι καὶ ἠγόραζον The Hebrew word here translated \"linen yarn\" is מִקְואֵ (i.q. מִקְוֶה niph. of קָוָה, \"to be gathered together\").' Gesenius, followed by De Wette (and others), and himself following Piscator (born tire. 1480) and Vatablus (born circ. 1546), would translate the word \"company,\" and read, \"a company of the king's merchants took a company (of horses) at a price.\" Others would translate the word \"import;\" and read, \"the import of the king's merchants was an import at a price,\" i.e. in money. Neither of these renderings can be considered really satisfactory. Some slight corruption of text still baulks us, therefore.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Six hundred shekels of silver. Some add up in this amount the vehicle itself, harness, horse or horses necessary to it, and the expense of carriage of the whole. Whether or no horses are included may be doubtful. The amount added up reaches, according to various estimates, £90 or £70. If we take the silver shekel at 3s. 4d. according to one of the later authorities (Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 81, 2nd edit.), the amount will be £100; and so for a horse £25. For all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria; see 2 Chronicles 8:7, 8; 2 Chronicles 9:14, 23, 24, 26; 1 Kings 4:21, 24; 2 Kings 7:6; which last place in particular suggests that Solomon would be the more willing to assist neighbouring peoples in the purchase of horses, etc., who might be already tributary to him, or even vassals, or who might in future be in the better position to help him, when either required or hired to do so.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The children of Moab.

It is very possible that Psalm 83, which is a psalm of Asaph, and which mentions the enmity of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, may be synchronous with this history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The battle is not yours, but God's; i.e. God will do the fighting (see ver. 17, first and third clauses); so also 1 Samuel 17:47.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The cliff of Ziz. Read with Revised Version, the ascent of Ziz (or probably Hazziz), a place named only here. The Hebrew word here rendered \"cliff ' is the familiar מַעֲלֵה, meaning \"an ascent,\" or \"a rising ground.\" It is replaced in the Septuagint by both ἀνάβασις and πρόσβασις. Stanley, in an interesting note on the word ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 500, edit. 1866), says it is applied to several localities in Palestine, viz.:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The \"Ascent of Akrabbim,\" i.e. scorpions (Numbers 34:4; Judges 1:36; Joshua 15:3), on the south border of Judah and probably the same as the Pass of Safeh.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"The going up to (or of) Adummim,\" i.e. the \"ascent of the Red,\" near Gilgal, on border of Judah and Benjamin (Joshua 15:7; Joshua 18:17), probably the same with the \"Pass of Jericho.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The\" going up to Gut\" (2 Kings 9:27).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Our present text.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The \"mounting up of Luhith\" in Moab (Isaiah 15:5; Jeremiah 48:5). The word is also applied to the steep pass from Gibeon to Beth-heron (Joshua 10:10; 1 Macc. 3:16); to the road up the Mount of Olives (2 Samuel 15:30); and to the approach to the city in which Samuel anointed Saul (1 Samuel 9:11), i.e. \"the hill up to the city.\" The passage, Judges 8:13, Authorized Version \"before the sun was up,\" Revised Version \"from the ascent of Heres,\" possibly designates a rising ground, named . 'the Ascent of the Sun,\" or, \"of Heres.\" The following extract from Keil, with its quotations from Robinson, is interesting. \"The wilderness Jezreel was without doubt the name of a part of the great stretch of fiat country bounded on the south by the Waddy El Ghar, and extending from the Dead Sea to the neighbourhood of Tekoa, which is now called El Hassasah, after a waddy on its northern side. The whole country on the west side of the Dead Sea,\" where it does not consist of mountain ridges or deep valleys, is high table-land sloping gradually towards the east, wholly waste, merely covered here and there by a few bushes and without the slightest trace of having ever been cultivated' (Robinson's 'Palest.,' sub voce). Our present ascent of Ziz, or Hazziz, has perhaps remained in the Waddy El Hassasah Robinson takes it to be the pass, which at present leads from Ain-jiddy to the table-land. Yet it is described by him as a 'fearful pass,' and it can hardly be thought of here even if the enemy like the Bedouins, now when on their forays, may be supposed to have marched along the shore of the sea, and ascended to the tableland only at Engedi; for the Israelites did not meet the enemy in this ascent, but above upon the table-land.\" Josephus translates הַצִּיצ by ἑξοχῆς, but with no legitimate justification. The end of the brook; i.e. rather the end of the brook-way, or course of the brook when there was water to make one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Stand... and see the salvation of the Lord with you. The grand original of these words (Exodus 14:13) would be known to both Jahaziel and Jehoshaphat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The infinite relief to the mind of Jehoshaphat and his people finds now fit expression in simple adoration. Would that such first gratitude were but sustained to the end more frequently than it is common to find the case!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Of the children of the Korhites; i.e., with Revised Version, of the Korahites, who were the best of the Kohathite family (1 Chronicles 6:22; also at head of Psalm 42-49, Authorized Version and Revised Version). Keil would translate, \"Of the sons of Kohath, yea, of the Korahites.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The wilderness of Tekoa. The king and people, army and prophet and Levite singers, start early for the wilderness of Tekoa, not less than ten miles' distance south of Jerusalem, and from it a waddy running to the Dead Sea. So shall ye be established. (So Isaiah 7:9.) Jehoshaphat's own faith and zeal make him nervously anxious that his people should not fall behind him, and fall short of their duty and the grandeur of the occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And when he had consulted with the people; i.e. possibly simply \"conferred with\" those who were over the singers, as to who should be the most prominent in leading the service of praise, or as to what should be the words sung and other like matters of detail; or more probably, considering the exact form of language used, the reference is to what we are told Jehoshaphat had just done, to wit, counselled well the people and given good advice to them. Praise the beauty of holiness. The rendering should no doubt be in the beauty of holiness, i.e. in garments of beauty (1 Chronicles 16:29; Psalm 29:2; Revised Version margin,\" in holy army \"). Praise the Lord; Revised Version, give thanks to the Lord (2 Chronicles 5:13; 2 Chronicles 7:3, 6; Psalm 106; Psalm 136.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Set ambushments. The Hebrew is נָתַן מְאָרְבִים, i.e. \"set persons lying in wait,\" or \"in ambush\" (piel part. plur. of אָרַב). So Judges 9:25, but kal participle with apparently future equivalent meaning occurs eighteen times in Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Ezra, Jeremiah, and Lamentations. Who the persons were, supernatural or not, or what their mode of operation, is not told, and is not plain. The effects are quite plain - that first the two confederates, Moab and Ammon, thought they saw reason to fall on them \"of Mount Seir,\" and secondly, having this done, to fall on one another to the end of mutual extermination. They were smitten. The marginal, \"they smote one another,\" may be better, but it is not at all necessary, the meaning being that collectively they became the smitten instead of the smiters!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - This verse proceeds to explain how this resulted in a kind of triangular duel on large scale.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The watch-tower. See 2 Chronicles 26:10, where, however, the ordinary מִגְדָּל, and not the present word (only found, except as a proper name, here and Isaiah 21:8), is employed. It is scarcely likely that a built watch-tower is intended even here, but rather a lofty site and point of view from which a large number of people could see. The proper names Mitzpeh (Mizpeh) and Mitzpah (Mizpah) are of course familiar. They looked unto the multitude. Judah and its army and heralding Levite singers would see now in new significance the thing said by Jahaziel in our ver. 16, \"Ye shall find them at the end of the brook-course, before the wilderness of Jeruel.\" And none escaped; i.e. \"without an exception.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Both riches with the dead bodies. The Hebrew text reads literally, both riches and dead bodies (no article). The וּפְגָרִים of the text, however, appears in several (\"old authorities,\" Revised Version) manuscripts, as וּבְגָדִים (\"garments\"), and the versions of both Septuagint and Vulgate lend their authority to this reading. Jewels. The Hebrew term is כְלֵי, the most frequent rendering of which is \"vessels,\" so rendered, that is, a hundred and sixty times out of about three hundred and eight times in all of its occurrence. It is, however, a word of very generic quality, and is rendered as here \"jewels\" about twenty-five other times. It would seem nugatory to tell us that there were \"dead bodies,\" in the bald rendering of \"and dead bodies.\" Our Authorized Version rendering, \"riches with the dead bodies,\" of course both ingeniously glosses the difficulty and makes a sufficiently good meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Berachah. This is just the Hebrew fern. subst, from a verb. It is used in 1 Chronicles 12:3 as the name of a man. The present name of the valley survives in the Waddy Bereikat on the Hebron road, beyond, therefore, the date unto this day of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The Lord had made them to rejoice. Note the extremely similar and almost identical language of Ezra 6:22 and Nehemiah 12:43, and add also to the comparison the last sentence of our ver. 29.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - With this verse compare particularly vers. 10, 11 of ch. 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - His God gave him rest (so see 2 Chronicles 15:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - With this verse recommences the parallel of 1 Kings 22:41-50. In this verse we find the addition in the parallel very naturally to be accounted for, of \"began to reign in the fourth year of Ahab King of Israel.\" Otherwise the verses are almost identical. Of Azubah nothing more is heard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Howbeit the high places... the people had not prepared. The statements so precisely made in this verse evidently serve the purpose of distinguishing between the wishes and orders of the king and the unequal conduct of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, etc. These \"acts of Jehoshaphat\" are said in this verse to find their record in the book of Jehu... mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. The parallel has, \"in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.\" For our \"mentioned,\" note margin, literal, made to ascend and Revised Version \"inserted.\" The \"book of the kings of Israel\" may (note also the remarkable apparent misnomers of our writer, as illustrated by 2 Chronicles 12:6; 2 Chronicles 21:2, 4) very possibly be one with the parallel, \"book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah\" (see our 'Introduction,' 1 Chronicles, pp. 7, 8.). Of this larger collected cyclopaedia of royal biography, Jehu's account (דִּבְרֵי) of Jehoshaphat was one component part. Though Jehu's (דִבְרֵי) book is not mentioned elsewhere, he himself is particularly in 1 Kings 16:1, as well as in our ch. 19:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And after this. The historical episode of these three verses (35-37) is evidently misplaced. As Ahaziah succeeded his father Ahab in Jehoshaphat's seventeenth year, we of course are at no loss to fix the time of Jehoshaphat's \"joining himself with Ahaziah.\" He had \"joined himself\" with Ahab, and had smarted for it, and yet \"after\" that, he \"joined himself\" with his son Ahaziah. We do not doubt that the \"who\" of this verse refers to Ahaziah, not, as some think, to Jehoshaphat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - This verse tells us the object with which Jehoshaphat had joined himself with Ahaziah, and 1 Kings 22:49 tells us how at last, by a point-blank refusal to Ahaziah, he withdrew from the very brief commercial alliance after he had not merely been witnessed against by the Prophet Eliezer spoken of in our next verse, but more decisively witnessed against by the shattering of his ships. To go to Tarshish. This clause, even if the text is not corrupt, yet cannot mean what it seems to say; but in the word \"to go\" (Hebrew, לָלֶכֶת) must mean, of the sort that were wont to go to Tarshish, i.e. that were used for the Tarshish trade. We are guided to some such explanation by 1 Kings 22:48, where it is said the ships were \"ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir\" (1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chronicles 8:18). That the ships could not be to go to Tarshish is plain from the fact of the place, Ezion-geber (2 Chronicles 8:17, 18; 1 Kings 9:26), on the Red Sea, where they were built. Some, however, have suggested that some other Tarshish (e.g. in the Gulf of Persia)than that of Spain (Tartessus) may conceivably be meant. The clear statement of the parallel saves the necessity of any such supposition, however.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles20:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah. Nothing beside is known of this prophet. For Mareshah, see 2 Chronicles 11:8, and note there. The ships were broken; i.e. presumably by some storm. One general remark may be made upon these verses (34-37), together with vers. 45-50 of 1 Kings 22, viz. that the dislocation of both manner and matter, observable in both, of them, probably betrays something out of order for whatever reason or accident, in the more original source, from which both drew, the apparently disjointed mixture of matter in the parallel being the more patent of the two.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The parallel for this verse is 1 Kings 22:50; and, with the exception of one word, it is an exact parallel. To understand the questions set in motion by the last clause of the verse, comparison must be made of 2 Kings 1:17; 2 Kings 3:1; 2 Kings 8:16. For anything that appears here, we should take for granted that Jehoram now first began to exercise any royal authority and enjoy any royal dignity. But the first of the just-quoted passages says Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded his wicked brother Ahaziah in the second year of Jehoram (of Judah), son of Jehoshaphat. In the second of the above-quoted passages, however, we are told that the same Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded to the throne in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, which date tallies with our parallel of last chapter (1 Kings 22:41), to the effect that Jehoshaphat himself began to reign in Ahab's fourth year, and Ahaziah in Jeho-saphat's seventeenth year. While, lastly, the third of the above-quoted references says that in the fifth year of Joram (of Israel), \"Jehoshaphat being then King of Judah\" (which, however, is itself an unfaithful rendering of what must be a corrupt text), his son Jehoram \"began to reign.\" It has therefore been conjectured that the royal name was given Jehoram (of Judah) by his father in his father's sixteenth year, and that in his twenty-third year he further invested him with some royal power (our ver. 3 gives some plausibility to this conjecture), from which last date Jehoram's \"eight years\" (2 Kings 8:17; 2 Chronicles 21:5, 20) must be reckoned; this was not less than two years before the death of Jehoshaphat. Were it not for the countenance that our third verse (describing the cut-and-dried arrangements that the father made for his sons) gives to the tenableness of the above conjectures, we should prefer the conjecture that the passages commented upon are so much corrupt text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Though in our version two Azariahs appear among the six sons of Jehoshaphat here given, the Hebrew text shows עֲזַרְיָה in the one place and עֲזַרְיָהוּ in the other. Nothing is known of the previous history of these six, now so cruelly murdered by their eldest brother. It will be observed that Jehoshaphat is styled King of Israel, probably merely generically. Into this way the writer of Chronicles would run, at any rate, more easily than the writer of Kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The father's foreseeing care issued very differently from what he had thought, waking now the greed and murderous intent of Jehoram. Jehoshaphat, nevertheless, was but following in the wake of the head of the separated kingdom of Judah, Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:22, 23), wherein he is said to have \"dealt wisely;\" even the parallel (in the matter of one son Abijah, sen of Maachah, the favourite wife, being appointed king) obtaining there in an aggravated form, as he was not the eldest son. This case, with those of Solomon and Jehoahaz (by the favour not of the parent but of the people, 2 Kings 23:30), formed the exceptions to the usual observance of and honour done to the principle of primogeniture (Deuteronomy 21:15-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Slew all his brethren... and also of the princes of Israel. It may be, as suggested by the genius of the last clause of our yet. 13, that Jehoram's wicked heart prompted him the rather because his own works were evil and his brothers' righteous. He may have thought their practical witness against him, and that of the \"princes\" who shared their fate, would be growingly inconvenient, and would work in them a necessary disloyalty (Judges 9:1-5). On the ether showing, the \"princes\" now cut down may have shown partiality and affection to the six brothers, one or other of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He reigned eight years. This rejoin dates to begin with the twenty-second or twenty-third year of the reign of his father Jehoshaphat, according to note on ver. 1, above. The parallel of 2 Kings 8:17-21 may be consulted for our vers. 5-11; our vers. 11, 13 expound in clearer detail the \"evil\" that Jehoram wrought than the narrative of Kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The daughter of Ahab to wife. That is, Athaliah, called (2 Chronicles 22:2; 2 Kings 8:26) the daughter, that is, granddaughter, of Omri.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The covenant... a light... his sons for ever (so 2 Samuel 7:12, 13, 15, 16; 2 Samuel 23:5; 1 Kings 8:20, 24, 25; 1 Chronicles 22:10; Psalm 132:11, 12; Isaiah 55:3; Acts 13:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In his days the Edomites revolted... made themselves a king. The expression, \"in his days,\" scarcely fails intending to accentuate the mournful change now as compared with the state of things depicted in our ch. 17:5-11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - With his princes. The parallel, 2 Kings 8:21, reads, \"to Zair.\" Of any such place nothing is known, and it has been proposed to supersede the word there by \"Self,\" which a certain amount of similarity of the Hebrew characters might countenance. Possibly by some mishap, not so readily explainable by misoccurrence of characters simply, our words, \"with his princes,\" should stand in place of \"to Zair.\" It must be noted that the two first clauses of the verse in the parallel become something inconsequential (which is not the case with the reading of our text), in that it says, \"The king and chariots went forth to a place, and rose up by night,\" etc. The dislocation is, perhaps, not serious, but our text avoids it in reading, \"The king, princes, and chariots went forth, and rose up by night and smote,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Libnah... because he had forsaken. The parallel states the revolt of Libnah also, but does not make the closing remark of our verse. Ver. 11 - Caused... to commit fornication. Perhaps the meaning is exclusively here the infidelity of idolatry, but at any rate it includes this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A writing. The Hebrew is מִכְתָּב, noun, from verb כָתַב. This noun does not occur very frequently, but is found in the following passages, viz.: Exodus 32:16; Exodus 39:30; Deuteronomy 10:4; 2 Chronicles 35:4; 2 Chronicles 36:22; Ezra 1:1; Isaiah 38:8. A note in Grove's interesting article, \"Elijah\" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' vol. 1. p. 580), says that the word is almost identical with the Arabic word of the present day, while the ordinary Hebrew word for a \"letter\" is סֵפֶד oftener rendered \"book.\" There came. That this is the precise language used rather helps the persuasion that it was the well-known Prophet Elijah of Israel, who, not resident in Judah, and perhaps very near the end of his life, and in sight of his translation, was taught and directed divinely to send this message of rebuke and terror for Jehoram. Elijah the prophet. Some hold that it certainly was not the well-known prophet of the northern kingdom who is here intended. \"Time, place, and circumstance,\" says Professor Dr. James G. Murphy, of Belfast ('Handbook to the Books of Chronicles,' p. 127), difference him \"from the Tishbite.\" And he confidently considers him (with Cajetan) another Elijah (Ezra 10:21), or Eliah (1 Chronicles 8:27; Ezra 10:26; for the form rendered so), or Eliyahu, in which form the Hebrew name appears (אֵלִיָּה. or אֵלִיָּהיּ, being the forms of the name found), on the grounds that the Tishbite was translated in the time of Jehoram's father Jehoshaphat (2 Kings 3:11); that his sphere was in the northern kingdom, and himself more of one who wrought mighty works and spoke otherwise than as a prophet; and that the designation \"the prophet\" need by no means denote him exclusively. He adds that a \"writing\" from a prophet is nothing strange, which may be easily conceded but poorly instanced by 1 Chronicles 28:19; better by Jeremiah 36:1, 2, 6. On the other hand, Grove (in article above quoted) and others find no invincible difficulty in accepting this Elijah for the famous prophet. His mention here is, of course, exceedingly interesting. as the only mention of him in Chro-nicles - a fact which very remarkably falls in with the abstinence as well as the fulness of the compiler of Chronicles. Josephus pronounces that the letter was sent during Elijah's life ('Ant.,' 9:05. § 2), surmises to the contrary having been made. While Elijah's translation seems to have taken place before Jehoshaphat's death, from what we read of Elisha (2 Kings 3:11), we may well account that Elisha had begun his ministry before his master's translation. Not only the ether passages that confirm, but in especial the passage (2 Kings 1:17) which tells of Jehoram's being, before his father's death, on the throne of Judah at the time of Elijah's interview with Ahaziah (a passage that occurs immediately preceding the account of Elijah's last acts), might have led us to suppose that Elijah's letter was before Jehoshaphat's death, during the joint reign, but for the mention of the slaying of his sons. Bertheau, in our text in his 'Chronik,' points out the resemblance which the \"writing\" shows to the matter of the speeches of Elijah, while in certain respects of style, and the very insulated sort of introduction it has here, it greatly differs from the narrative in which it is now set. Although the calculation may seem rather a fine one, the circumstances described accurately point to the \"writing\" of Elijah reaching Jehoram before the chronologically misplaced translation of Elijah as given in 2 Kings 2:1-11. This question may be instanced as one of the interesting moot points by no means compassed with insuperable difficulty, but challenging careful study and patient comparison of chronological and historical passages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - See note in previous verse on Jehoram's slaying of his brethren, and the conclusive proof this statement allows that Elijah's letter must have been subsequent to the death of Jehoshaphat. The better thin thyself probably points to the fact that they had not fallen into idolatrous practices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A great plague; Hebrew, מַגֵּפָה, Out of the twenty-six occurrences of this word, it is rendered (Authorized Version) twenty-three times by the word \"plague,\" twice by the word \"slaughter\" (2 Samuel 17:9; 2 Samuel 18:7), and once \"stroke\" (Ezekiel 24:16). It is not the word (גֶגַע) which about sixty times (chiefly in Leviticus)describes the physical plague, but both of the words are applied to the plagues, e.g. of Pharaoh, and to the suffering that came of any severe smiting of the people. As no physical affliction in the shape of disease visited, so far as we know, the people, wives, and children of the king, and as his goods are reckoned in for the great plague, the general opinion is probably the correct one, that the invasions spoken of (vers. 16, 17) fulfilled the punishment now announced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Therefore against Jehoram and Judas Iscariot and Herod was it decreed that their very bowels should bear witness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The moreover of this verse is simply the conjunction \"and;\" it is not the m of ver. 11, for instance. Our Authorized Version \"moreover\" obscures the purport of the verse. Better the simple \"and,\" as in the Revised Version. The Lord stirred up. Reference may again be made to 2 Chronicles 17:10-12. The things then gained are now being lost. The Arabians... near the Ethiopians. The Ethiopians, i.e. Cushites, fully fifteen centuries before the date of those original treatises from which the writers of Kings and Chronicles respectively borrowed their materials, or some of them, are recorded both genealogically and geographically in Genesis 10:6-8. They had their location very early in the south of Arabia, as also to the south of Egypt, speaking generally, with the Red Sea on the east, the Libyan desert on the west, and Abyssinia on the south, whilst Syene marked conspicuously a site on the line of the northern bounds between them and Egypt (Ezekiel 29:9-11; Isaiah 18:1, 2; Isaiah 45:14; Zephaniah 3:10). They are almost invariably connected with Africa, from whence it is now that stress is laid upon those of them to whom the Arabians, on the other side of the Red Sea, were contiguous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Brake into it; Hebrew, kal future of בָּקַע (compare the other four significant and expressive occurrences of this exact form, Judges 15:19; 2 Samuel 23:16; 1 Chronicles 11:18; Isaiah 48:21). The elementary idea of the root is to divide; and it occurs in one conjugation or another fifty-one times, there being no more typical occurrence than that of Genesis 7:11. Carried away. The Hebrew uses the word \"carried captive\" (וַיִּשְׁבּוּ); possibly the order of ver. 14 is inadvertently neglected, which puts the living beings before all the substance, or, goods (כָּל־הָרְכוּשׁ). His sons also. From 2 Chronicles 24:7 we note that the sons were not punished for their father's sins alone, but for their own. Jehoahaz. This person is called Ahaziah in 2 Chronicles 22:1 (the syllables of the name being reversed) and Azariah in 2 Chronicles 22:6, which cannot be explained, but must be supposed an error. The Jehoiachin of 2 Chronicles 36:9 is written Jeconiah, or Jechoniah, in 1 Chronicles 3:16, 17; Coniah in Jeremiah 22:24, etc.; and Jechoniah in 2 Chronicles 24:1, etc. The two parts of the word combined in either order make the same meaning. On account of the express mention of the camp in 2 Chronicles 22:1, some think that the slaughter and the plunder were all such as might have been wrought in the royal quarters there; others that we are to infer the taking by assault of Jerusalem itself and what was therein.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - An incurable disease; i.e. it was so severe that it was in this case incurable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - After the end of two years. That \"two years'\" space began at the end of nearly two years after his father's death. Two years' warning and space for repentance subsequent Jehoram had turned to no account, and even affliction and suffering brought him no 'amendment. No burning (see our note on 2 Chronicles 16:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Departed without being desired; literally, without desire. The closing commentary, so quietly written, becomes the more pathetically mournful The \"desire\" spoken of is the desiderium of Horace, of nearly nine centuries later ('Odes,' L 24). But there was now no \"desiderium... tam cari capitis,\" for want of room for this latter description. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings (see again our note on 2 Chronicles 16:14; and comp. 2 Chronicles 24:25; 2 Chronicles 28:27).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This verse does not so much purport to say how the inhabitants of Jerusalem proceeded to appoint Ahaziah, in default of any previous appointment on the part of his father, but merely that whereas they appointed him, the youngest son, it was because they had no choice, the elder brothers having been slain (2 Chronicles 21:17). though the deceased Jehoram possibly might not have known up to the time of his death, for certain, of their several deaths. This, if we may judge from the particular language here used, had been brought about at the bands of the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp, now first particularized. The parallel (2 Kings 8:25), wanting both of these items, states that this reign began in the twelfth year of Joram of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Forty and two; read, twenty and two, and see parallel, 2 Kings 8:26; and note on our 2 Chronicles 21:5.

In this and the following two verses stress is laid on the evil counsel and the sources of it that prejudiced Ahaziah to his ruin. Although the parallel wants these direct statements, perhaps it scarcely says less, when it says (ver. 27), \"For he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellers after the death of his father to his destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He... went with Jehoram the son of Ahab. So the evil example of even the good lives after them. See Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 22:29; 2 Chronicles 18:8) followed by his son Jehoram first (2 Kings 3:9), and now by his grandson Ahaziah. The words of this verse and the next are almost identical with the parallel (2 Kings 8:28, 29). Ramoth-Gilead. It will be remembered that Ahab failed when he solicited and obtained the help of Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 22:3-36; 2 Chronicles 18:3-34) in his enterprise against Ramoth-Gilead. The present attempt, however, seems to have had a different issue (2 Kings 9:14, 15). The Syrians; Hebrew, הָרַמִּים. The initial radical here should be א, from neglect of observing which the Septuagint has translated \"archers\" (relate).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Both places (this and the parallel) tell first that Ahaziah went with Joram against Hazael; then that Joram, being smitten, returned for healing to Jezreel; next that Ahaziah, out of compassion in some sort, went down to see Joram in Jezreel; and lastly, it is here signalized that in that very deed of his, Providence brought it about that Jehu lighted upon the track of him (vers. 7-9), and he met his end. This feature of the history the writer of Chronicles wishes to exhibit, as usual. Ramah; i.q. Ramoth-Gilead. Jezreel. This was a town in the Plain of Jezreel (Esdraelon), belonging to the tribe of Issachar. For Azariah read Ahaziah; compare אֲחַזְיָהוּ (Ahaziah) and יְהואָחָז (Jehoahaz), the meaning of both being \"held\" or \"upheld of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He went out with Jehoram against Jehu. The \"against\" is the simple preposition אֶל, and need intend nothing more than \"to meet\" Jehu; not to meet him hostilely. What the manner of the meeting was, however, we know from 2 Kings 9:21, 22, 27, 28. The history of this and following two verses is here given very briefly; much must be filled in to give its full explanation, as in 2 Kings 9:11-29. Whom the Lord had anointed to out off the house of Ahab; i.e. had raised him to the throne, possessed of the characteristic qualities which he had for this purpose (2 Kings 9:1-7; 1 Kings 19:16). Jehu the son of Nimshi. Strictly, \"the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi\" (2 Kings 9:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Executing judgment upon the house of Ahab. The description of all this is sufficiently graphically scattered along the verses of 2 Kings 9:24 - 11:20. And found the princes of Judah (see especially 2 Kings 10:7, 11; 2 Kings 11:13-20). And the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah. This both explains and is explained by 2 Kings 10:12-14. That ministered to Ahaziah. Even this enigmatical little clause receives its probable explanation from the last clause of ver. 13 in last quotation foregoing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him... brought him... buried him. This verse, which at the first sight seems at variance with 2 Kings 9:27, 28, is perhaps a simply surprising instance of undesigned corroboration of history by the treatment of different historians. The verse, e.g., corrects the italics of 2 Kings 9:27; expunging them throws their proper force into the words, \"at the going up to Gur,\" showing that Jehu reckoned on that steep kill to enable his pursuing warriors to overtake Ahaziah; makes a sufficiently possible harmony, to say the least, in respect of the remaining incidents narrated of his life - that he made for the time a successful flight to Megiddo, afterwards sought to hide in deeper retirement in Samaria, was thence brought to Jehu at Megiddo, there eventually slain before his eyes, and by his own servants, who must be supposed to have had some attachment to him, but probably with the sanction of Jehu himself, conveyed \"in a chariot to Jerusalem\" for sepulture \"in the sepulchre of his fathers in the city of David\" (2 Kings 9:28). The fact that he received decent burial being due to the God-fearing character of his grandfather, and that this should find its record on the page of the book that will last while the world lasts, that very page already two thousand five hundred years old, is a most touching consideration. Megiddo was on the Esdraelon or Jezreel plain, that stretched between the hills of Galilee and those of Mount Ephraim or Samaria. Had no power to keep still the kingdom. The undoubted meaning of this clause is that there was no one of the house of Ahaziah who could succeed him. The Hebrew text does not say, \"no one left,\" etc. But the allusion can scarcely be to anything but the fact that transpires in our ver. 11 (where only Joash is mentioned as a son, and with him a nurse), viz. that his only surviving son was an infant, The king's sons (presumably sons of Ahaziah and grandsons of her own) were among the \"seed royal,\" whom the wicked Athaliah had \"destroyed.\" Gesenius says that the words that wrap in them the slight ambiguity, עָצַר כֹחַ, are a phrase peculiar to the later Hebrew, and he instances nine examples, all of which come from Daniel or Chronicles, the virtue of the phrase amounting to the ports ease of the Latin. Translate, And there was no one of the house of Ahaziah able for the kingdom, the exacter conditions of the case not being recorded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But when Athaliah. For parallel to the end of the chapter, see 2 Kings 11:1-3. The words, of the house of Judah, are here carefully supplied, wanting in parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - After of the king, the parallel conveniently certifies the name, Joram, and adds, \"sister of Ahaziah\" (very possibly half-sister, though), and afterwards particularizes the hiding, as from Athaliah, as in the latter part of this verse. We are here told, what is not mentioned in the parallel, that Jehosheba was \"wife of Jehoiada the priest,\" probably the high priest. Nor is this negatived by the fact that the name is not found (1 Chronicles 6.) in the line from Aaron to Jozadak; for this is only the line of Jozadak's ancestors, all of whom were not high priests. Joash is to be heard of again (2 Kings 11:21; 2 Chronicles 24:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - With them hid in the house of God six years. During this time evidently Athaliah reigned. There were in the \"house of God\" chambers sacred to the use of either priests or temple officials (1 Kings 6:5-10).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jehoiada strengthened himself (see our note, 2 Chronicles 12:1; 2 Chronicles 13:7). He nerved himself with courage, and that courage which results from conviction of duty and of ripe time to achieve it. The captains of hundreds (or, centurions of the royal guards) are not mentioned in the parallel by name, but the significant mention there (2 Kings 11:5-7) of five detachments (three \"third parts,\" plus \"two parts\" of another body) tally with the number five, who are here mentioned by name. The five detachments probably summed up a force of nominally five hundred. It is interesting to note how often high religious enterprises have been due to the trusting mutual co-operation of very few to begin with, and them awakened and led by one. Of no one of these five named here is anything known more to his honour than this - that his name is here recorded. It is said with the most perfect simplicity of even Hebrew language, that he took them with him in covenant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - No mention is made in the parallel of the Levites, whom our writer is sure to signalize. The fathers of Israel. The sacredness of the phrase made it dear, above the narrowness of the distinctive appellation Judah, though the worthies all were gathered, as just;implied, out of \"Judah.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All the congregation; i.e. all who have been mentioned in vers. 1 and 2; for so the parallel makes plain. Made a covenant. This was the second wider and more embracing covenant. This covenant is between all the gathered representatives and the young king, Jehoiada no doubt putting all things into shape. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign. The he is Jehoiada, as of course. In view of the last clause of ver. 4 - in the parallel, \"Jehoiada showed them the king's son \" - the likelier rendering of our text here is, Behold the king's son; he shall reign, as, etc. As the Lord hath said of the sons of David (see 2 Chronicles 6:16; 2 Chronicles 7:18; 2 Samuel 7:12; 1 Kings 2:4; 1 Kings 9:5). The hereditary nature of the monarchy (2 Samuel 7.), pervaded ever by the spirit of the covenant, is evidently glanced at. It is probable that the existence of Joash was news to those to whom Jehoiada, as the parallel has it, \"showed... the king's son,\" so that double significance lies in the word \"showed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The first thing that is to be observed is the distinct and repeated mention of the Levites, as those on whom the critical and onerous service that came of Jehoiada's resolution was devolved, while the parallel does not so much as mention them. It may next be noted that our first and second verses state the part that \"the captains of hundreds\" were called to perform in collecting the requisite number of Levites from the provincial cities of Judah. And once more it may be noted that whereas, while we abide close by our own text alone, nothing in the description of our vers. 4-10 occasions material difficulty, even when the perplexity, which is considerable, does enter, on consulting and endeavouring to reconcile the parallel, it is with extreme probability due to our not making sufficient allowance for the fact that the matter of the two accounts does not so much offer itself for reconciliation as for concurrent acceptance. We have now to follow the description of our own text. Of you entering on the sabbath; i.e. of you who enter on your period of duty on such a sabbath. See ver. 8, the \"men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath.\" This alludes, as the next clause definitely says, to the weekly courses of the Levites, as described in 1 Chronicles 9:25; 1 Chronicles 24; 1 Chronicles 25. - the incoming and outgoing companies. Porters of the doors; i.e. \"keepers of the doors of the temple\" (1 Chronicles 9:19). This may correspond with the middle clause of ver. 6 in the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A third part... at the king's house. It seems impossible to refer this to the royal palace, as some suppose from ver. 19 in the parallel. It probably designates the place where the child had been living in concealment. This portion of the description appears to correspond with the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel. At the gate of the foundation. The Hebrew text here is יְסוד (Exodus 29:12; Leviticus 4:7; Habakkuk 3:13); in the parallel סוּר, a name only found there, and unintelligible - probably a corruption of the other word. The gate of the foundation is supposed to have stood at that corner of the area which was strengthened by additional works, where was the ravine separating Moriah and the hill to the south. All the people. Evidently the miscellaneous outside people are not here intended, who were not entrusted with the secret and the surprise that was to be, but the same all the people as are unmistakably designated in ver. 10; i.e. all who were appointed to officiate. The last clause in each of vers. 5, 6, 7 in the parallel go strongly to confirm the position that\" the king's house \"so far does not intend the royal palace, but such part of the house of the Lord as had been, and then still was, \"about the king\" (ver. 7, parallel); in order to keep watch \"about the king,' they were set to keep watch of a certain part of \"the house of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But let none come... save the priests. Through this little chink we get some light confirmatory of the concurrent jurisdiction of the account in the parallel The express caution of this clause shows that there were others about, and others officiating, beside the Levites, who only have been mentioned hitherto in our text, except under the most generic designation (as before, so again in last clause of this verse) of \"all the people.\" The last clause of this verse may cover the contents of ver. 7 in the parallel. The distinction between \"the courts of the house of the Lord\" (ver. 5), and \"the house of the Lord\" (ver. 6) is, of course, quite apparent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And the Levites shall compass the king. The matter of ver. 8 in the parallel suggests nothing inconsistent with the express mention of the Levites here, but rather that the word \"Levites\" is desiderated there, and its significance perhaps accidentally overlooked, when the writer of Kings was using the original authorities and sources of his history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - All Judah; i.e. all those of Judah's provincial cities who had been honoured with summons to join in this great and solemn enterprise. Dismissed not the courses; i.e. the provincial Levites cooperated with the regulars of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Shields... King David's ... in the house of God. Some think these may have been the shields of gold that King David took from the servants of Hadadezer (2 Samuel 8:7, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All the people; i.e., again, all those, not being Levites and priests, who had been trusted to assist. The parallel (ver. 11) summarizes them under the name the guard. It may be just noted, in passing, that, while the Hebrew text has in both places \"shoulder,\" i.e. for the \"side\" of this verse, and the \"corner\" of the parallel, the Revised Version has harmonized the rendering, electing the rendering side. From the right side of the temple to the left side. This is equivalent to saying, those composing the guard were placed on the south and north sides. Along by the altar. This was the altar of burnt offerings in front of the perch, and close by which the young \"king stood at his pillar,\" or on his pedestal (ver. 13), the rows of the guard bristling with weapons before and behind and round about him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Then they brought out. The parallel (ver. 12) has, \"he brought out,\" etc. The last clause of our verse harmonizes even this simple point, indicating that the \"they\" designates \"Jehoiada and his sons;\" of which group Jehoiada himself was, of course, the greatest part. It will be noted that it is not said from what exact place Joash was brought out. Put upon him the crown and... the testimony. It is quite unnecessary, at any rate, to suppose that the testimony, as well as the crown, was put on the head of Joash. It may be taken for granted that the testimony was put into his hands (Deuteronomy 17:18-20; Deuteronomy 31:24-29). If something new and so out of the way as resting the testimony (i.e. the book of the Law) on the head were purported, it is likely that a distincter point would have been made of it. God save the king!

The parallel (2 Kings 11:13-16) shows only two differences of any noteworthiness, and these will come under notice next verse. The noise; Hebrew, the voice; i.e. no doubt the voices of the people. Praising. The Hebrew is the piel participle; our corresponding phrase would be, \"singing out the praises of the king,\" i.e. not any personal praises, but such as the cries of \"Long live the king!\" or, as our Authorized Version has it, \"God save the king I\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - At his pillar (see note on ver. 10). At the entering in. The parallel (2 Kings 11:14) has \"as the manner was\" (ךשׂךשׁ כַּמִּשְׁפָּט בַּמָּבוא). The reading in the parallel is quite explainable by such references as 2 Kings 23:3; 2 Chronicles 34:31). Such as taught. Piel participle of יָדַע; the meaning here probably being not literally the teaching confraternity as such, but the leaders, and in particular those who were appointed on this occasion to lead. Treason! קֶשֶׁר; interesting references are 2 Samuel 15:12; 1 Kings 16:20; Isaiah 8:12; Jeremiah 11:9; Ezekiel 22:25. The idea of the word is conspiracy, and Athaliah's eye read this at once, and not less promptly, that it amounted to treason to her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Brought out, וַיּוצֵא, for \"commanded\" in the parallel, וַיְצּו; and this is probably right, the Hebrew in our text probably a clerical or copyist's error. The ranges; שְׂדֵרות. This word is found only in three other places, viz. twice in the parallel (its vers. 8, 15), Revised Version \"ranks,\" and in 1 Kings 6:9, where it is rendered in the Authorized Version \"the boards,\" but in the Revised Version \"the planks,\" and margin \"rows.\" The ranges are commonly supposed to mean the ranks or rows of soldiers. The Vulgate (septa templi) has understood them to mean the precincts of the temple. The indications of the remarkable but not uncommon prepositional expression, אֶל־מִבֵּית (enjoying the analogy of ether compounded prepositional expressions, as אֶל־מִחוּצ אֶל־מִגֶּגֶנ) favours the idea that Jehoiada said, Have her forth from inside \"the house of the Lord\" (ver. 12), to within your ranks, and there take care to make a way for her, no one with immature zeal following to slay her there, at the jeopardy of his own life, for under no case let her be slain in the house of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Between him. The Revised Version reads \"himself,\" which is the evident meaning. The parallel leaves out, however, mention of Jehoiada as party to the covenant, viewing him rather as the promoter of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The house of Baal. It becomes plain that some building had been actually reared alongside, so to say, of the very temple itself, for Baal. Slew Mattan (Deuteronomy 13:6, 9). Brake... his images; Hebrew, צְלָמָיו; this is the more pronounced word, distinguished from מַצְּבות.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Jehoiada appointed; i.e. reappointed or restored. The offices; פְקֻדות.

There should, no doubt, be found the conjunction \"and\" after this word and before \"the Levites,\" whom David had distributed (so 1 Chronicles 24:1-19; 1 Chronicles 25:8-31). In the Law of Moses (Numbers 18:1-7; 38:2). With rejoicing... singing...

There is some doubt as to what this gate was, whether the temple gate of 2 Chronicles 27:3, the chief gate of the outer court, or whether it was merely a palace gate, and not identified also with the precincts of the temple. It is called in the parallel \"the gate of the guard.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINE","2Chr.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJoash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - His mother's name... Zibiah of Beersheba. We do not read, in the brief account of Ahaziah, Joash's father, whom he married. Nothing is as yet known of Zibiah, but there must be some significance underlying the mention of her name and native place, or known place of residence. The references Amos 5:5 and Amos 8:14 may possibly contain the clue, in holding up Beersheba as the most idolatrous of idolatrous places. Beersheba offers another reference of unhappy associations (1 Samuel 8:2). As a terminus of the land, \"Dan to Beersheba\" (Judges 20:1; 2 Samuel 24:2; 1 Chronicles 21:2); as a terminus of the divided Judah, \"Beersheba to Mount Ephraim\" (2 Chronicles 19:4), \"Geba to Beersheba\" (2 Kings 23:8); and as a terminus of this Judah yet reduced after the Captivity, \"Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom\" (Nehemiah 11:30);-its mention is notorious. The references Genesis 21:31 and Genesis 26:18, 31-33 are full of interest, as bearing on the way in which the spot is first known in Bible history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - All the days of Jehoiada. Of the \"forty years\" mentioned in the former verse, these \"days of Jehoiada\" will cover, some, at any rate, say, two years more than \"twenty-two years;\" for compare our vers. 6, 12-15 with the parallel, 2 Kings 12:6, 7, 9, noting the thenceforward silence there respecting Jehoiada, and even making ample allowance for it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - That special note is made of Jehoiada's selecting of the wives may at any rate point to the suggestion that he was all a father to Joash, and both for his own sake and the kingdom's sake anxious as to the character of the women by whom a new kingly seed should take rise in place of that destroyed by Athaliah (2 Chronicles 22:10). Our 2 Chronicles 25:1 leaves it probable that \"Jehoaden of Jerusalem\" was one of these, though it is likely enough that Joash married, whether her or some one else, before he had reached the age of twenty-one. It is also quite likely that we may read between the lines, that in selecting two wives for his young and loved ward, Jehoiada hoped and prayed that Joash might not fall by sin like Solomon's (1 Kings 11:3) and that of others of the kings of both Judah and Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - To repair. The idea of this verb (חָדַשׁ) is that of making new.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - To repair. The idea of this verb (חָזַק) is that of making strong. From year to year. The compound adverbial expression חָדֵּי, here used for \"from,\" era-braces the idea of\" unfailingly from year to year.\" The command given here to the priests and Levites is expressed very differently, though in no degree contadictorily, in the parallel (see its vers. 4, 5). The addition is there found, \"every man of his acquaintance;\" this expression may glance at the very supposable circumstance that the priest and Levite collecting deputations would naturally go respectively to the towns and cities where they had been located beforetime. A slight ambiguity is perhaps occasioned by the impression that the fourth verse (in the parallel) produces - that the priests and Levites should wait to receive, e.g., in Jerusalem. This, however, is sot what is said, and need not, therefore, be made into a difficulty. Howbeit the Levites hastened not. We are not told why this delay was, nor does the subsequent narrative seem to elucidate it, further than this - that the delay somehow seemed to rest with Jehoiada, as the king appealed to him for explanation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Jehoiada the chief; so. priest, for comp. our ver. 11; 2 Chronicles 19:11; 2 Chronicles 26:20. In each of those instances the Hebrew text shows הָראשׁ, and the Authorized Version \"chief\" except inconsistently in our ver. 11. Revised Version \"chief\" in all the instances. The name \"priest\" occurs just about six hundred and sixty-six times in the Old Testament, the title \"high\" or \"chief priest\" only about twenty-six times, the first occurrence being in Leviticus 21:10, the last Zechariah 6:11; and both set forth by the Hebrew adjective גָּדול, as also in fifteen other of the occurrences. Seven times the word רלֺאשׁ is the word employed, and שָׂרֵיthe other two times. In these last two cases, however (Ezra 8:24, 29; Ezra 10:5), it is not \"high priests\" nor \"chief priests\" that are perhaps even really intended, but the \"princes\" of the priests, or those who, for whatever reasons of personal characteristics, were chief. Out of Judah and out of Jerusalem. The statement here is precise, that the call of money was to be made both in the cities of Judah and in the metropolis Jerusalem. The collection; Hebrew, מַשְׁאַת; Revised Version, better, the tax of, etc. Of this we read in Exodus 30:13-15; Exodus 38:25, 26; Numbers 1:30. It was of the uniform amount of half a sanctuary shekel, for rich or poor, and was ordered to be set apart \"for the service of the tabernacle of the conregation,\" here called in the Authorized Version the tabernacle of witness; Revised Version, the tent of the testimony. Exodus has מועֵד for our חָעֵדוּת. This source of money for the holy design of Joash is again most specifically stated in our ver. 9. The version of this whole transaction seems rather confusing as given in the parallel, where ver. 4 mentions three sources of money, without any quotation as such of the ordained tax of Moses, which was apparently the first of those three, and where ver. 8, at first blush at any rate, might seem to imply recusant priests. The meaning, however, is probably the contrary, the verse purporting that the priests consented to forego what they had been accustomed on receiving to apply to some personal or current-funds purpose, and who consented to forego the superintending of the outlay of the money on. the repairing, that it might be done with more expedition by \"scribe\" and high priest\" (ver. 10; comp. ver. 16; both of the parallel). All these details the writer of Chronicles passes over, only pursuing the essential business, Joash's pious resolve, the delay in its execution, and how he finally overcame the obstructive delay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The sons of Athaliah. This verse's testimony against Athaliah's sons explains 2 Chronicles 21:17, and is explained and corroborated by it. That wicked woman; Hebrew, הַמִּרְשַׁעַת; fem. noun, derivative of רַשַׁע; meaning strictly in the abstract, \"the wickedness,\" equal to that incarnation of wickedness. All the dedicated things; i.e. the holy vessels, treasure, and holy furniture of the house of the Lord, had they desecrated, and robbed' them thence to squander them on their various Baals (2 Chronicles 17:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - A chest; Hebrew, אֲרון אֶחָד, \"one chest.\" This is more accurately described in ver. 9 of the parallel. Without at the gate of the house of the Lord; i.e. in the court opposite the porch, and, as we learn from the parallel, by the side of the altar of burnt offering. Now, not the priests generally, but simply those who kept the door (probably the north door, Ezekiel 11:35), receiving the contributions of the people at their hands, into their own hands deposited them in the one chest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - (See notes on ver. 6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Until they had made an end; Hebrew, לְכִּלֵּה, piel infin. The meaning can scarcely be till enough was obtained, because day after day, as the next verso tells us, the chest was brought; but either till those who had come that day to give had all given in their contributions, or, as some think with much less probability, till the chest was full for the day. At the same time, the clause, occupying only one word in the original, may quite possibly purport to state summarily by anticipation that the same system was observed to the end, and the method of the chest not departed from.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Unto the king's office. Not \"office\" in the modern technical business sense; the meaning is the care, charge, or custody of the king, the Hebrew word being פְקֻדַּת; nor does this necessitate the supposition of the personal care of the king. The body of this verse leaves it quite open to possibility, in harmony with the usage of the Hebrew language and its idiom, that the process described took place, if necessary, more than once in a day, and, on the other hand, not necessarily every evening. The change of the number of the verb in \"they emptied,\" etc., and the apparent statement that those who emptied also carried back the chest, betoken that while the king's scribe (1 Kings 4:3) and the high priest's officer stood by, the usual Levite functionaries did the work. The phrase, day by day, is not necessarily equivalent to every evening, but to time after time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Gave it to such as did the work of the service; i.e. the persons responsible for the work, or \"that had the oversight of it\" (2 Kings 12:11). Carpenters. It is preferable to render here literally workmen or workers. Probably this clause purports that those responsible, as above, hired masons and workmen. And also such as wrought. Supply the preposition found in the Hebrew text, \"to\" before \"such,\" and render again the same word (חָרָשֵׁי) literally, workers of iron and brass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The work was perfected by their hands. The margin gives the literal rendering, \"healing\" or health, or, i.e., recovery, \"went up upon the work.\" The lively figure of the Hebrew word used (אֲרוּכָה) is very intelligible. The term is employed in only five other places, viz. Nehemiah 4:7 (Authorized Version, \"The walls were made up;\" Revised Version better, The repairing of the walls went forward); Isaiah 58:8; Jeremiah 8:22; Jeremiah 30:17; Jeremiah 33:6; in each of which four instances, in both Authorized Version and Revised Version, the literal rendering \"health\" or \"healing\" is found. In his state; equivalent to in its stateliness, perhaps the idea of the Hebrew word מַתְכֻּנְהּו [only used four other times, and then rendered once \"tale\" (Exodus 5:8), twice \"composition\" (2 Chronicles 30:32, 37), once \"measure\" (Ezekiel 45:11)], being measure, or proportion, or rate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And to offer withal. The insertion of the italic type in the Authorized Version \"withal\" unnecessarily helps suggest uncertainty in this rendering, while the Revised Version gives that word in the ordinary type; margin, both Authorized Version and Revised Version, gives \"pestles.\" The Hebrew word is (הַעֲלות) the hiph. turin, of the familiar verb עָלָה or plural of עֲלי with article prefixed; this word, however, seems to occur only once (Proverbs 27:22), and then in the singular number. The rest of the money... made vessels for the house of the Lord. This passage may harmonize not unsatisfactorily with the parallel (2 Kings 12:13), and on the very suggestion of the circumstantial evidence that arises from the place in which the information of our own text is found, by laying emphasis on the expression,.\"the rest of the money.\" The writer of Kings meant that nothing interfered with, nothing whatsoever ran even with the execution of the substantial work of reparation of the building, and he neglects to record that finally a remanet of money being available, vessels were made of it for the inner furnishing of the house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But Jehoiada... died; an hundred and thirty years old. This good man, husband of Jehoram's daughter (2 Chronicles 22:11), only comes to view in virtue of what his wife did, and what he did,; on behalf of Joash the infant and Joash the king for the good of the nation or kingdom of Judah. We seem to know too little of him, and the parallel supplies considerably less than our text in Chronicles. His age, as stated in this verse when he died, seems very improbable, and for a very clear and admirable putting of the case, see Lord Arthur C. Hervey's article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:944. There is, however, no manifest or even suspicious symptom of corruptness in the text just here, supported as it is by the Septuagint and Josephus, by the stress laid on his old age, whether it showed a hundred and thirty years, or thirty years or fifty years (as have been variously suggested) fewer; the little fact, otherwise looking very significant, that the expression, full of days, is used beside only of Abraham, Isaac, Job, and David, loses its pertinence in that very circumstance that it is used of David, whose age was in no way extreme. The age of the other three, however, exceeded this reputed age given to Jehoiada!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The honour done Jehoiada well belonged to him, not only for his goodness, his greatness, his practical services to the kingdom, but for the fact that those practical services had entailed the necessity of his standing in loco regis for some time. His royal alliance with Jeheram's daughter, and, if it were so, his extreme patriarchal age, may all have contributed to the honour now put upon him. Little stress can be laid, however, upon this last consideration, failing any other allusion to it, or any emphasized statement of what we have in our ver. 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The princes. These turned aside from the better part they had performed (2 Chronicles 23:13, 20). Made obeisance; Hebrew, יִשְׁתַּחֲווּ. This is the word that is used of the sheaves of the brethren of Joseph bowing down, according to his dream, to his sheaf; it is also the repeatedly used word of the worship paid to Jehovah the true God, and to idols and false gods. The word occurs nearly two hundred times. The obeisance of these princes, therefore, on this occasion lacked nothing of the most pronounced character, and the worst species of flattery gained its disastrous ends. Joash must have been now about thirty-six years of age; he was seven years old when he began to reign, he had reigned twenty-three years before the restoring of the temple (2 Kings 12:6), and a few years had elapsed since. The words of the princes, to which Joash hearkened, are not supplied by the parallel, which indeed at once proceeds to speak of the threatening attitude of the Syrian king Hazael, and of how Joash bought him off. Our next verse, however, shows to what end those words tended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Served groves; Revised Version, the Asherim, correctly (see note, 2 Chronicles 14:3). For this their trespass. Comparing the emphatic language of ver. 23,\" destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people,\" we may conclude that stress is to be laid on the pronoun \"their\" in the present verse. The worship of the true God was not left by the whole people, and we are not told it was by the king; but (very probably through want of moral courage) he incurred the severest sort of blame, and was without even the excuse of strong personal temptation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Prophets. The name of only one, Zechariah, as in next verse, is given (see by the side of this verse the emphatic and touching language of 2 Chronicles 36:14-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Came upon; margin, clothed; Revised Version margin, clothed itself with (1 Chronicles 12:18). Compare the beautiful expression of Revelation 1:10, I was in the Spirit;\" it was not merely that the Spirit deigned to visit St. John in Patmos, but so possessed him that he was in the Spirit. The son of Jehoiada; i.e. very possibly grandson of Jehoiada (Jehoiada's great age the rather countenancing this interpretation) and \"son of Barachias\" (Matthew 23:35). That ye cannot prosper. The Hebrew text says, \"and ye will not prosper.\" This clause may read all the more forcibly if kept under the dominance of the why of the former, reminding us of such appeals as \"Why will ye die?\" etc. (2 Chronicles 15:2; Deuteronomy 18, throughout). Reading these two clauses in the preterite or present tense will make them neither less forcible nor less correct, so indicating that they, the princes and the nation, were already beginning to eat the fruit of their ways, and \"rumours of war,\" if not war itself, were on them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Stoned him. Yet this was their Law's punishment for themselves, for idolaters (Leviticus 20:2). At the commandment of the king. The king, who had yielded to the flattering obeisance and worship of the princes, is now driven on a grievous length further. In the court of the house of the Lord. So Matthew 23:35, \"between the temple [Revised Version, 'sanctuary'] and the altar.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Remembered not the kindness (Genesis 40:23). The Lord look upon it, and require it. So, too, the Revised Version, which also, according to its custom, removes the italic type from the two neuter pronouns \"it.\" But probabaly a better and correcter rendering is, \"The Lord will see and will require\" (for it is not necessary to regard this as a prayer of Zechariah); and thus bring it into comparison with those divinest prayers of the Saviour and of St. Stephen. The words on dying Zechariah's lips were perhaps rather the vivid reminiscence of his own well-versed knowledge of the Law, or \"the Scriptures\" (Genesis 9:5; Genesis 42:22). The sentence of the dying priest and prophet in one, is, by the writer of Chronicles at any rate, directed in its fall with fearful straightness to the door of Joash the king himself. Remarkable as is the absence of the matter of this and the five preceding verses from the parallel, it will not escape notice how it is implied in vers. 17,18 there, while the inclusion of it here is again in patent harmony with the great object of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - At the end of the year; Hebrew, תְּקוּפַת; margin, both of the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, revolution. The word is found three other times, Exodus 34:22; 1 Samuel 1:20; Psalm 19:7. The versions, of course, express correctly what is meant, but probably the season of spring is also conveyed (2 Samuel 11:1; 1 Chronicles 20:1). The host of Syria. Their king was Hazael (2 Kings 12:17), whether actually with them is perhaps not certain, but the last clause in the verse just quoted would seem to convey that impression. He was King of Damascus (Aram, or Syria), and having already temporarily mastered Israel (2 Kings 13:3, 4, 22), the way was paved to Gath (2 Chronicles 11:8; 2 Chronicles 17:11), whence wistful eyes were bent on Jerusalem, nearly thirty miles distant thence. Destroyed all the princes of the people; i.e. as in the next verse. And sent all the spoil. Whether intended so here or not, probably the strict subject of the verb in this clause is Joash and his counsellors (ver. 18 in parallel), in their fright - and just fright - helpless after the slaughter chronicled in our following verse, bribing off Hazael and his host, as in parallel. The suggestion is most plausible that tidings of Zechariah's martyrdom and of the occasion of it were the very incentive to Hazael's incursion, and an illustration of the \"means\" by which God works, and by which he wrought his purpose in this instance. The spoil of them. If this means only the spoil of the defeated army strictly, then our text gives no trace of the contents of ver. 18 in parallel just alluded to; but the frequent dislocation incident to copied extracts and matter borrowed from original sources, and so often evidenced in the present history, when we have been comparing the two derived accounts to which we are indebted for it, incline us to the above view, as one quite open at any rate to possibility.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Came with a small company... the Lord delivered a very great host (so Leviticus 26:8; Deuteronomy 28:25, etc.). So they executed judgment against Joash. The Hebrew says literally, \"and on Joash they executed judgments.\" What the judgments were we do not read, but surely it is probable that they are glanced at in the next verse, \"For they left him in great [or, 'many'] diseases,\" or perhaps \"in great illness\" (2 Chronicles 21:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They left him in great diseases. See note above, and observe further that this parenthetic clause, as treated in both Authorized Version and Revised Version, prepares the way for what follows, and especially for the fact that it was on his bed that they slew him. Render thus, And after they had betaken themselves away, whereas they left him sorely ill, his own servants conspired... and slew him in his bed. His own servants. These had the opportunity the rather at hand, in that he was so ill and in bed. That he died by the conspiring together of a couple of servants, whose foreign and heathen maternity is particularly recorded, was the more ignominious end for him, who had commanded Zechariah to be openly stoned - a death highly honourable in comparison. The parallel (2 Kings 12:20) adds that it was in \"the house of Mille, which goeth down to Silla\" (for the explanation of which passage, see note ad loc.), that the servants' conspiracy to kill Joash took effect. The sons of Jehoiada. We know of only one son, Zechariah; there may have been other sons, or other lineal relations of Jehoiada may be covered by the word \"sons.\" We are not obliged to interpret the avenging act of the servants as one to which their own pious and patriotic zeal led them, which, considering their maternal pedigree, is perhaps something unlikely, though of course not impossible, but one to which they were incited by the retributive providence of him who held their hearts also in his hand. In a word, it was a deed done for the bleed - required (see note and references under ver. 22). Not in the sepulchres of the kings. See note on ver. 16, and references there quoted; as also the ambiguous expression of the parallel (ver. 21), \"They buried him with his fathers in the city of David.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Zabad. The name Jozachar of the parallel is probably the correct word, and a copyist's corruption may with some plausibility be argued as the cause of the form Zabad in our text. The parallel omits the names of the mothers' nationality. Shimrith. The parallel has Shomer, probably an Hebraized form of the Moabitish name of our text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles24:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - His sons. We only know of one, Amaziah, his successor. The burdens laid upon him. Some explain this expression of the tribute and bribe Joash had to pay Hazael; others of prophetic \"burdens\" uttered against him; and others (much favoured by the position of the clause just before the repairing of the house, etc.) of the task which he had so voluntarily undertaken, the money-raising and all (Ezekiel 24:25; comp. our vers. 6, 9, 11). The repairing; Hebrew, וִיסור. Render, with the Revised Version, the rebuilding. The story of the book of the kings. The Revised Version renders the Hebrew text (מִדְּרַשׁ סֵפֶר) \"the commentary of the book of the kings,\" probably to be followed by the words, \"of Judah;\" the parallel has \"the book of the Chronicles [סִפֶד דִּבְרֵי הַיָמִים] of the kings of Judah\" (see our Introduction, 1 Chronicles, § 5, pp. 7-10.). The word rendered \"story\" or \"commentary\" in our text is employed only once beside (2 Chronicles 13:22). Its verbal root, however, is found about a hundred and sixty-two times, invariably in the sense of inquiring, and almost invariably rendered in the Authorized Version by the word \"inquire,\" or \"seek;\" so that perhaps the word \"study\" or \"pursuit\" might, idioms being allowed for, be the nearer rendering. It is rabbinic literature mostly that has determined the preference for the word \"commentary.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Twenty and five years old... reigned twenty and nine years. Glance at notes on vers. 1, 15, 17 of foregoing chapter, from which it appears that, as Joash died aetat. forty-seven, and Amaziah was now twenty-five, he must have been born when his father was twenty-two years old, and Jehoaddan correspondingly likely to have been one of the two wives Jehoiada selected for Joash, at the age, on other data, of twenty-one years. Of Jerusalem. This affix to the mother's name may perhaps carry credit to the memory of Jehoiada, for having been careful to select a woman of the honoured city rather than of any provincial or even less worthy city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Not with a perfect heart. This is illustrated by his coming \"to set up the gods of Edom\" (vers. 14-16, 20); also by what the parallel supplies, that he resembled Joash rather than David, and did not suppress \"the high places, sacrifices, and in-cense-burning\" (2 Kings 14:3, 4). In almost all cases, the not perfect heart speaks of that which began well, but did not \"endure unto the end.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Was established to him; Hebrew, חָזְקָה. This is kal conjugation of the verb, which we found in piel in ver. 5 of foregoing chapter, and there rendered \"repair.\" The kal force of the word is simply to \"be strong\" (Genesis 41:57; Joshua 17:13; 2 Kings 14:5). The hiph., to \"make strong,\" or \"confirm,\" as it is rendered here, is found in 2 Kings 15:19. Again and again the disorders of the kingdom and the violent deaths of prophets and kings must have greatly contributed to nervous apprehensions, in fact only too just, when a new king ascended the throne. In the parallel and in passage last quoted the words, \"in his hand,\" follow the verb. Amaziah both needed to get his own hand in, according to modern phrase, and to get things well into his hand. His servants. It may be held surprising that they should have been found \"in the place,\" or should now be his servants at all. The explanation may be either that their guilt had not yet been known, or, if known, had not been fixed upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Slew not their children. Emphasis (the emphasis of mention, at any rate) is laid upon this, perhaps partly to show that Amaziah did in some measure walk by \"the Law of the Lord,\" and partly because of numerous cases that had grown up to the opposite (2 Kings 9:8, 26; Joshua 7:24, 25, where, however, very possibly all were more or less aiders and abettors of the wickedness). For Moses' clearly written rehearsal of \"the commandment of the Lord,\" on this subject, see the marginal references, Deuteronomy 24:16; Jeremiah 31:29, 30; Ezekiel 18:4, 19, 20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This and the following five verses are entirely omitted in the parallel, which contents itself with giving in its ver. 7, in fewer words, but with the supplement of other matter, what is contained in our ver. 11. Found them three hundred thousand. Compare Asa's \"five hundred and eighty thousand\" (2 Chronicles 14:8), and Jehoshaphat's \"eleven hundred and sixty thousand\" (2 Chronicles 17:14-19; see note, however, on these verses, and the improbability of numbers so high). The Hebrew text of the second clause of this verse simply says, \"he set them\" (יַעֲמִידֵם), or placed them according to... fathers' houses, under captains, etc., glancing most naturally at Numbers 1:2-2:34. Twenty years old and above (comp. 1 Chronicles 27:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Out of Israel. The next verse tells us that \"all the children of Ephraim\" (which was strictly the northern Israel's chief tribe) are hereby designated. It is not quite clear that this Israel is exactly conterminous with the Israel of 2 Chronicles 13:3, the identity of which, however, with Joab's Israel (2 Samuel 24:9) is very probable. The boundaries of the strict tribe of Ephraim, whose ancestor was Joseph's younger son, are described in Joshua 16:5. The tribe were located as nearly as possible in the centre of the land. Ephraim, however, is here, as in many other places, as the name of the royal tribe, so named upon the whole of the northern kingdom (Isaiah 9:8; Isaiah 17:3; Isaiah 28:3; several times in almost every chapter of Hosea, and for a typical instance, cf. Hosea 14:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - (See foregoing chapter, ver. 19.) The name of this man of God does not transpire. To wit, with. These three words, all in italic type, if entirely omitted, and not even the preposition adopted, as in the Revised Version, into the ordinary type, will leave the intention of the writer clearer rather than less clear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It is hard to feel satisfied as to the correct rendering of this verse. The drift of the next verse, which shows Amaziah a convert to the strong exhortation of the man of God, makes either alternative allowable under the present text very untimely. and not very much in accord with what we should look for at the lips of the man of God. The very conceivable way out of the difficulty is to read לא, hyphened to אם (all the rather that no vau is present in בּלֺא, as the present text is), and proceed to supply בּא or בּוא again before אַתָּה, crediting some copyist with confusion of eye through these having come close together in his manuscript. The rendering will then be straightforward, and prepare the way for Amaziah's yielding conformably with the tenor of the next verse. \"But if not\" (i.e. if thou wilt not be guided by my remonstrance as to Ephraim), \"go thou, be on the alert, exert all the strength possible for the battle, and yet nevertheless God will cause thee to stumble.\" And the remaining sentence may bear this significance, \"For God hath power to help thee though alone, or to cast thee down though supported by an extra hundred thousand.\" If such alteration or conjectural restoration of the text be not accepted, we may harmonize the facts of the case with the most utter faithfulness of lip on the part of the prophet, by translating, \"For in very truth, if thou go at all, and though thou make the best preparations, God shall make it go ill with thee.\" And Amaziah is persuaded to this point, that he will neither risk the lives of them of Ephraim vainly, nor risk the likelier displeasure of God on himself. He yields only partly, and therefore is nothing benefited. The difficulty is left untouched, that the prophet did not simply in toto forbid Amaziah to go, and that, saving them of Ephraim, he saves them to be a second scourge for the back of Amaziah, though he took his prophet's advice so far, and lost his own money. A careful and devout observer of human life and perverseness, when once these commit themselves to the vain struggle with God, and equally vain attempt to haggle with his providence as to how much to yield and how much to resist and with. hold, cannot but be struck with the photograph here thrown off, and that it is a faithful one, of hard facts that have met together disastrously times without number in men's lives. The sum, then, of the matter of our vers. 7, 8 may amount to this: \"Under no circumstances take Israel, and if thou go thyself with all best preparations, yet know that God shall destroy thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This verse is consummate in the two touches by which it sets forth the phase of earth's calculatingness respecting the perishable, and Heaven's swift disposal of any such trifling difficulty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - It appears that, though this contingent from Israel's land was a hired force, yet for some reason their heart was in their calling, perhaps in anticipation of plunder. It may well be that they asked why they were discharged; and whether the right answer were given them, that the Lord dwelt not among them, or some wrong answer, it evidently did not improve matters, but rankled in their hearts till it found relief (vers. 13, 22), as they concluded that either their ability or fidelity, or both, were called in question. The 'Speaker's Commentary' very aptly cites the keen resentment and mortification that the Athenians are recorded to have felt in similar circumstances as told in Plutarch's 'Lives:' \"Cimon,\" §17. Separated them. This is the verb occurring several times in the first verses of Genesis 1. (יַבְדִּילֵם); there it is always followed by the preposition בֵּי, when speaking of the separating of two things from one another. Though this be meant here, it is not what is exactly said, and the prefix preposition לְbefore the substantive (לְהַגְּדוּד) may, as Keil says, be regarded as designating the appositional accusative to that affixed in the shape of the pronoun \"them\" to the verb.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Strengthened himself. The hithp, conjugation of our already familiar verb חָזַק; it was not a healthy strengthening, and this may be considered denoted in the fact that the work was all his own, and that he wrought himself up. The valley of salt. Commonly supposed to be the plain south of the Salt Sea, but according to Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' Appendix. § 2. 5, pp. 482, 483), more probably a \"ravine near Petra\" (1 Chronicles 18:12; 2 Samuel 8:13). (For the association of Seir with Edom, see Genesis 36:17-20; 2 Chronicles 20:10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The top of the rock. The parallel uses the Hebrew word without translation, Selah (הַסֶּלַע). There is little doubt that this is Petra (Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' 305; Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' 87-92). The parallel tells us the interesting fact that Amaziah, perhaps under the influence of a spasmodic touch of devout-hess or gratitude, changed the name of Selah, or rather endeavoured to change it, to Joktheel, which Gesenius translates \"subjugated of God.\" This name had already occurred in Joshua 15:38. The new name, however, did not last, as the Edomites recovered soon the country of (2 Chronicles 28:17; Amos 1:11; Isaiah 16:1, 2) Arabia Petraea, of which Selah or Petra was the capital. Left alive. The Revised Version correctly renders, carry away alive. The cruelty of the Edomites receives many illustrations (see last references, and Ezekiel 25:12-14; Obadiah 1:1-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The soldiers... sent back... fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon. There is probably something to read between the lines here, to wit, that the soldiers returned to their master add king (Joash of Israel), and were by him remitted to this work. The mention of Samaria before Beth-horon (see map) indicates it, and the words \"sent back\" may be held to imply, at least, that they first went back - that the disappointment of spoil was the chief part of their aggravations, so that now the rather they got their much spoil, and note made thereof, and that - since not so much the instructive and so far forth more excusable revenge on the part of the disappointed soldiers, but the deliberate plan and order of their king had brought about this devastation of Amaziah's domains, in this fact we have the key of what we read in our vers. 17, 18, etc., and of the very cool manner in which Amaziah challenged Joash. The cities of Judah attacked were apparently those that once had belonged to Ephraim. Smote three thousand of them; i.e. of the people of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Brought the gods of the children of Seir... to be his gods. Amaziah's devout gratitude to God, and acknowledgment of him in the name Joktheel, was soon gone, and at the very last, grown confident, he loses all, and realizes the fulfilment of the \"man of God's\" prophetic denunciations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He sent unto him a prophet. We are again not told whom. The tone of the prophet, and the words given us as his in the latter half of ver. 16, would lead us to think it was the same \"man of God;\" but we cannot assert it, and had it been the same, it would more probably have transpired. The history now often reminds us of 2 Chronicles 24:16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The chapter well keeps up in this verse its graphic character, though the culminating instances of it are yet to come. Forbear. The faithful prophet is \"wise as the serpent, harmless as the dove.\" He does forbear, but not till the application of his speech, and all that was needful is most outspokenly (more so than before he had heard the usual coward fashion of the tyrant's threat) pronounced. His forbearing, therefore, is open to no charge of moral cowardice and unprophet-like infidelity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Took advice; i.e. took counsel; as in foregoing verse, \"Art thou made king's counsellor?\" and as in same verse, \"counselled\" should read instead of \"determined,\" The verb (יָעצ), in kal, niph., and once only in hithp., occurs just eighty times, always in this sense, and almost always so rendered in the Authorized Version, Let us see one another in the face. A refined analogy to this expression, with all its speaking significance, occurs in 2 Samuel 2:13; and, perhaps yet more remarkably, a strange some balance between vers. 14, 15, 17 of that chapter and our vers. 21, 22 may be noticed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The thistle... sent to the cedar. While other history shows frequently the abounding Eastern delight in this exact kind of composition, it will be remembered that it is not absent from Scripture, and that this is not the first recorded instance of it by three hundred and fifty years, for see Judges 9:7-15. The thistle; Hebrew, הַחוַח. The word occurs, beside the four times here and in the parallel, eight other times: 1 Samuel 13:6; 2 Chronicles 33:11; Job 31:40; Job 41:2; Proverbs 26:9; Song of Solomon 2:2; Isaiah 34:13; Hosea 9:6. Although, then, the word we have here is not the \"bramble\" (אָטָד) of Judges 9:15, which also is brought before us in its contrast with Lebanon's cedar, yet the bramble bush, chiefly in virtue of its characteristic thorn, best answers to the average suggestions of all the twelve instances of the use of our word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If the contents of this verse do not fail to impress with a persuasion of the keen mental gift of Joash, they do not fall far short of warranting some persuasion of a certain moral sense and goodness about him also. He knows human nature well, and Amaziah's particular variety therein perfectly well. And many would have snapped at the opportunity of humbling such a man. But not so Joash; he enjoys, indeed, the opportunity of satisfying his own sarcasm and patronizingness, but would still spare Amaziah's people and save him from himself. This does not resemble, at any rote, the commonest, poorest, hungriest style of soul. To boast. Our text gives us here hiph. infinitive construct, where the parallel has niph. imperative. This lends the more effective shaft to the invective of Joash, though without material difference to the sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The whole of the religious reflection, with its special post-Captivity significance of this verse, is wanting in the parallel, and finds no suggestion either thence or from common authorities. The parallel shows the statement, But Amaziah would not hear, followed up immediately by \"Therefore Jehoash... went up.\" Our own verse, in the use of the plural pronoun them, and again they, takes some slight amount of the weight of guilt in the matter of the idolatry from the shoulders of the king, that it may be shared by the people, and no doubt chiefly again by the \"princes\" (2 Chronicles 24:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Beth-shemesh. The Beth-shomesh of Judah, on the borders of Judah, Dan, and the Philistines, is to be distinguished from that on the boundary of Issachar (Joshua 19:22), and \"the fenced city of Naphtali\" (Joshua 19:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Joash... took; Hebrew, תָּפַּשׂ, \"seized\" (as Genesis 39:12), or \"caught up\" (as Deuteronomy 9:17), or \"capture\" (as Joshua 8:8). The gate of Ephraim (see Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 343). It led out on the north or north-west side of the city. There is very little to identify it with the high gate of Benjamin (see ditto, p. 346). The corner gate. This is not the translation of our Hebrew text (שַׁעַר הַפּונֶה, which, see margin, means \"that looketh\"), but of the Hebrew text of the parallel (חַפִנָּה); see pp. 343-346 of Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' and map facing p. 334, 2nd edit.

The present verse is an interesting one for pointing out the exact differences, even to the minutest of them, in what the two writers (of Kings and Chronicles) respectively took from a common original; e.g. the writer of Kings has \"he took;\" leaves out \"Obed-Edom;\" has not the preposition \"in\" before \"the house;\" has \"Jehovah\" instead of \"God;\" has the preposition \"in\" before \"treasures;\" and has \"Samaria-ward\" (i.e. to Samaria) instead of only \"Samaria;\" the writer of Chronicles differing in each of these respects. All the gold... in the house of God. See 2 Kings 12:17, 18, from which we must conclude that Hazael had already had the pick both for quantity and for quality. The hostages also; the phrase runs in the Hebrew text, \"and sons [or, 'the sons'] of the hostages\" (הַתַּעֲרֻבות יְאֵת בְּנַי); the literal rendering of which is \"children or sons of pledges,\" i.e. hostages. The word (and indeed the practice so prevalent elsewhere) is found only here and in the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Amaziah... lived after the death of Joash. The composition of the previous two verses dismisses delicately the fact that Joash, ignominiously bringing \"Amaziah to Jerusalem\" (ver. 23), contemptuously left him there, with a present of his life, though less his honour and much wealth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The book of the kings of Judah and Israel. The parallel has \"the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.\" Considering the amount and the character of the resemblance that we have noticed between the narratives in Kings and in our own text, and assuming that the work to which each compiler calls attention for the fuller elucidation of his subject of biography is the work which he has himself most largely laid under 'contribution, then we should justly feel in this instance that we had no feeble argument for the identity of the two works, called by rather different titles - by the writer of the pre-Captivity, \"the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah,\" and by him of the post-Captivity, \"the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the Lord. Let it be particularly noted that the entire of this sentence (which is a strong anachronism sui generis) is wanting in the parallel. It is, of course, in its matter intrinsically true, but none the less misleading in its form. The object of the writer cannot be doubted, as so many a cross-light is thrown upon it, in other places, viz. to connect the rise and the operativeness of the conspiracy with the .fact that (though not the exact date at which) the king had turned aside from Jehovah to idols. They made a conspiracy. When every deduction is made, it may be that the conspiracy was one that was long hatching, and one which began in embryo from the date of Amaziah's ignominious return to Jerusalem. Very certain it is that this would be historic certainty with the Paris of the past century or more. The French would have required a deadly explanation of such an affront, if brought upon them by any ruler of theirs. He fled to Lachish. In the Shefelah of Judah, and a strongly fortified place (2 Chronicles 11:9; Joshua 10:3, 32; Joshua 15:39; 2 Kings 14:19; 2 Kings 18:14; 2 Kings 19:8; Isaiah 36:2; Jeremiah 34:7; Micah 1:13). Eusebius places it seven Roman miles south of Eleutheropolis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles25:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - They brought him upon horses; Hebrew text, \"upon the horses,\" i.e. those same royal horses presumably with which he had fled to Lachish. This seems the most natural suggestion arising from the memorandum made here, and may indicate that they visited him with no additional gratuitous disrespect. In the city of Judah. Probably an incorrect text for that of 2 Kings 14:20, \"the city of David,\" which is found in some of the manuscripts.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Uzziah; Hebrew, עֻזִּיָּה. (signifying \"Strength of Jehovah\"). Once in Chronicles, and once only (1 Chronicles 3:12), this king's name is given Azariah, Hebrew, עֲזַרְיָה (signifying \"Help of Jehovah\") or עֲזַרְיָהוּ; and Isaiah (Isaiah 1:1, etc.), Hosea (Hosea 1:1, etc.), and Amos (Amos 1:1, etc.) always use the word Uzziah. In the parallel, however, and in both the chapters in which the parallel clauses lie, the word Azariah is used, as well in other clauses as in those (e.g. 2 Kings 15:1, 6, 8, 23, 27), yet Uzziah is also used in verses intermingled with them (e.g. 13, 30, 32, 34). It is probable that Azariah was the first-used name, that the latter name was not a corruption of the former, but that, for whatever reason, the king was called by both names. Nevertheless, the apt analogy that has been pointed out of Uzziel (1 Chronicles 25:4) and Azareel (18) is noteworthy. (See Keil and Bertheau on 1 Kings 15:2 and 2 Kings 14:21; and Keil on our present passage.) Sixteen years old. Therefore Uzziah must have been born just before the fatal outside mistake of his father's life in the challenge he sent to Joash of Israel, and after the deadly inner mistake of his soul in turning aside to \"the gods of the children of Seir.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Eloth; Hebrew, אֶת־אֵילות; the parallel reads אֵילַת. This place was at the head of the Gulf Akaba (2 Chronicles 8:17; 1 Kings 9:26); Judah had lost hold of it at a past revolt of Edom, and Uzziah, after his father's crippling of Edom, seizes the opportunity of making it Judah's again and rebuilding it, thus finishing very probably a work that he knew had been in his father's heart to do. This consideration may explain alike the following clause in our verse. and the placing of this here. Uzziah charged himself to do it the first thing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Jecoliah. This name is spelt Jecholiah in the parallel. The character, however, is kappa in both texts. The meaning of the name is, \"Made strong of Jehovah.\" Another unreliable form of the name is Jekiliah, the result probably of a mere clerical error.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Right... according to... his father. His father's comparatively long reign, sullied by two frightful stains, which were fearfully visited with a long punishment and a fatal end, is graciously recognized here for the good that was in it, and apparently credited even with a \"balance to the good.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5 - In the days of Zechariah. Twice in the foregoing chapter we have read of \"a man of God\" and \"a prophet\" whose names are not given. The chariness of the narrative in this exact respect is not very explicable, for if the simple reason be assumed to be that they were not of much repute, now when the name of Zechariah is given, all that we can say is that nothing else is known of him. Had understanding; Hebrew, הַמֵּבִין. There seems no reason to divest this hiph. conjugation form of its stricter signification, \"gave understanding \"(see Isaiah 40:14). In the visions of God; Hebrew, בִּרְאות. Some slight discrepancy in the usual fuller writing of the word in some manuscripts lends a little ground of preference for the reading, which a few manuscripts evidently had (see Septuagint Version, ἐν φόβῳ,), of בִּירְאַת; i.e. \"in the fear of God\" (Proverbs 1:7; Isaiah 11:3); either reading in either of these sub-clauses leaves an undisturbed good meaning to the description of Zechariah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Philistines. It has been seen how the Philistines, humbled to tribute under Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 17:10-13), had lifted up their heads repeatedly since, as on one occasion in alliance with Arabians (2 Chronicles 21:16, 17) against Jehoram. Brake down the wall (see 2 Chronicles 25:23, the first occasion of this exact expression). Gath (see the parallel to our 2 Chronicles 24:23, 24 in 2 Kings 12:17). Jabneh. A city on the coast, northwest of Judah, now Jebna (see Joshua 15:10-12). Ashdod. Also on the coast, about eight miles south of Jabneh (Joshua 15:47). It is now a large village in Philistia, called Esdud, answering to the Azotus of Acts 8:40 (see Topographical Index to Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible;' and Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' sub voc., 1:119). Built cities about Ashdod; Revised Version supplies in italic type\" in the country of Ashdod.\" However, the force of the preposition בְּ before \"Ashdod\" in this case speaks for itself; on account of the great importance of the place, in respect of its situation, on the road to Egypt, the strength of its position and perhaps the memory of the fact that, allotted to Judah, it had never really been appropriated by her, and incorporated with her, Uzziah saw it expedient to surround it with other fortified cities, or strong forts, which should be a watch upon it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Gur-baal. Though nothing is known of this place (the meaning of which is \"abode of Baal,\" perhaps from some temple of Baal), yet its companion Maon, the city of the Mehunim (2 Chronicles 22:1; Judges 10:12), shows whereabouts it was.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Ammonites. This nation lay east of Jordan, north-east of Moab. Note the interesting references, Numbers 21:24; Deuteronomy 2:37. Gave gifts. This expression was found in our 2 Chronicles 17:11; 1 Kings 4:21; 1 Kings 10:25. The reference to tribute-payment is evident. The entering in of Egypt. This, of course, marks the breadth of the land, and describes the breadth of Uzziah's sway or influence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Built towers in Jerusalem. The excellent map, above alluded to (2 Chronicles 25:23), in Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible' (2nd edit.), facing p. 334, furnishes a very clear idea alike of these towers and of the walls of Jerusalem, as we can make them out, for Uzziah's times. For the corner gate, see our note, 2 Chronicles 25:23. Valley gate. This is called by some the Gehenna gate. As many as three sites, reducible perhaps to two, are proposed for this gate:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the west gate, called somewhile the \"Jaffa\" gate; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) a gate over the valley of\" Hinnom;\" or, if it be not the same,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that at the valley of Tyropoeon. And at the turning; Hebrew, הַמִקְצוַע. This word occurs eleven times, viz. twice in Exodus, four times in Nehemiah, four times in Ezekiel, and in this place, and is always rendered \"corner\" or\" turning;\" the word wanted is angle. The site of this gate cannot very certainly be pronounced upon. Perhaps the angle that marks the gate is that at the south-east corner of the temple plateau. The language of Nehemiah 3:19 is our best clue: \"Next to him Ezer repaired... a piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Towers in the desert; Hebrew, בַּמִּזְבָּר; the rendering should be the usual one of \"wilderness.\" This was the cattle-pasture west and south-west of the Dead Sea. The towers were needed for forts of observation against marauding and cattle-robbing incursions, as well as for shelter in some attacks. Many wells; Hebrew, בֹּרות. These were not springs, but rather, as in the margin, tanks and cisterns. Carmel. It is not probable that this is the proper name. The translation of Carmel is \"fertile field.\" As a proper name it occurs about twenty times, from Joshua 12:22; Joshua 15:55; Joshua 19:26; on to Amos 1:2; Amos 9:3; and perhaps Micah 7:14; and as not a proper name it occurs about twenty times also; the \"fruitful field,\" e.g., of Isaiah 29:17 and Isaiah 32:15 shows in the Hebrew text הַכַּרְמֶל. The aspect of this verse is very picturesque, and the picturesqueness very pleasant, with its low country and pasturing cattle, its plains and their herds, its hills and their vines, all quickened into life by the mention of towers and wells, husbandmen and vine-dressers, and finished off by the home-touch that this king's partiality looked to agricultural and pastoral pursuits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - That went out to war by bands; Hebrew, יוצְאֵי צָבָא לִגְדוּד. The last of these words occurs thirty-three times, and is rendered \"troop\" ten times, \"company\" four times, \"band\" fourteen times, and (too generically) \"army \"five times. The middle word occurs above four hundred times, is rendered \"host\" an immense preponderance of these times, and probably should have been so rendered without exception. The first word is the pool participle kal of the familiar verb יָצָא, and compels the translation (given literally),' the goers out of the host by hands.\" Meantime, if the persons here spoken of were leaders, as seems possible, the hiph. participle is required (which would postulate an initial mem for the present initial yod), and a most typical example among some thirty others essentially similar may be quoted from Isaiah 40:26. Their account by the hand of Jeiel; i.e. their muster tabulated by Jeiel, whose office is mentioned before in our 2 Chronicles 25:11. Under the hand of Hananiah.

The \"of\" here is incorrect; the former sub-stautive is not necessarily in construct state, and this word has the prefix of the preposition לְ; nor is the rendering \"valour\" for our Hebrew text חָיִל so likely a rendering as that found in the foregoing verse, \"host.\" Render, The whole number of the chief of the fathers in the mighty men of the host was, etc. So in the next verse. \"with mighty power\" will be better rendered \"with the strength of a host.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - An army; Hebrew, חֵיל צָבָא. \"A force of host\" would render this expression, though by an ambiguous use of the word חֵיל construct state of חַיִל. This verse gives the number of the body of the army proper, which shows it seven thousand five hundred more than that of Amaziah in the foregoing chapter (ver. 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Habergeons... slings to cast stones. Revised Version right in rendering, coats of mail... and stones for slinging. On the Israelites' employment of the sling, note Judges 20:16; 1 Samuel 17:40; 2 Kings 3:25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Engines; Hebrew, חִשְּׁבֹנות; used only here and Ecclesiastes 7:29 (where it is rendered \"inventions\"), but the related word חֶשְׁבּון is found three times: Ecclesiastes 7:25 (the \"reason\"), 27 (the \"account\"); 9:10 (\"device\"); while the verb root חָשַׁב, to \"devise,\" occurs about a hundred and thirty times, as in next sub-clause מַחֲשֶׁבֶת חושֵׁב. A strict rendering of the clause would make it read, \"He made inventions, the inventing of an inventive man;\" and the force of the words might be to appraise very highly the virtue of the invention or machine, while to himself may have been due the credit thereof. The balista which discharged stones is depicted on Assyrian sculptures; not so the machine for discharging darts and arrows, the catapult. Although, as just suggested, it were conceivable that to Uzziah himself was due in part the invention or the great improving of the machines in question, yet the verse may be regarded as simply saying that the introduction of them into Jerusalem was his work. He was marvellously helped (see ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To (his) destruction; Hebrew, עַד־לְחַשְׁחִית, hiph. conjugation infin, of שָׁחַת. This conjugation frequently occurs in the sense of \"destroying,\" but also as well without an accusative as with, in the sense of \"doing corruptly\" (Genesis 6:12 with accusative; but without Deuteronomy 4:16; Deuteronomy 31:29; Judges 2:19; Isaiah 1:19; and next chapter, ver. 2). He transgressed. The \"transgression\" of a heart that had waxed wanton through prosperity took that peculiarly aggravated form of sinning against holy things and a holy ceremonial. Although, in the daily service of the second temple, the duty of offering incense attached to one chosen by lot each morning and evening of the inferior priests, yet originally the high priest was solemnly appointed for this office. The following are among the most important references to the matter of the incense and its offering (Exodus 25:6; Exodus 30:1, 7, 8, 34, 37, 38; Leviticus 16:13; Luke 1:21; Numbers 6:24-26; Numbers 16:1-35; Numbers 18:1-7; 1 Kings 4:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Azariah the priest. Ver. 20 states what was otherwise to be supposed, that he was the chief priest (הָראשׁ). We fail to identify his name with any in the typical list of 1 Chronicles 6:4-15, where the Azariah of ver. 11 is too early, and the Azariah of ver. 13 too late, for our present Azariah. With him four score priests. This passage suggests to us an idea of how many deeply interesting details are wanting, which would fill in the interstices of Old Testament history. Probably the intention of the king, ambitious to simulate the self-assumed religious ways of neighbouring Gentile kings, was no secret; and possibly the king may have given time for the chief priest to collect his auxiliaries, through some ostentatious display on his own part, in the very performance of his desecration. The number and the character of these helping priests (בְּנֵי־חָיַל) give the idea that they had their work to do, and purposed doing it promptly, or that they would over-awe, and obviate the use of actual force, by their imposing number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They withstood. A somewhat more forcible rendering would be justified by the Hebrew text, such e.g. as, \"They confronted Uzziah to his face,\" or \"They stood in the way of Uzziah,\" since our \"withstood\" almost always conveys the idea of argumentative confronting only. There was expostulation here, as we are immediately told, but there was something else also, as ver. 20 makes very plain, \"They thrust him out.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Render, Then Uzziah was wrath, and in his hand (at that moment) was a censer to burn incense, etc. From the most literal rendering of the Hebrew text, not unfrequently the most forcible Bible English results. From beside; render, at the very side of (comp. Numbers 12:10; 2 Kings 5:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They thrust him out. This hiph. conjugation of kal בָּהַל does not point to the force adopted, but to the trembling anxiety with which, for horror's sake of such a monstrous catastrophe, as a leper by the altar and with a censer in his hand, etc., the priests urged him out. Evidently, from the next clause, no great force in the ordinary sense was needed. Yea, himself hasted. The Hebrew verb is niph. conjugation of דָחַפ. It is interesting to note that this root occurs only here and three times in Esther, viz. 3:15; 6:12; 8:14. Uzziah can scarcely have been ignorant that he had been daring the utmost penalty of the Law (Numbers 16:31, 35; Numbers 18:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And dwelt in a several house. The Hebrew for \"several house\" is הַחָפְשׁות: the parallel (2 Kings 15:5) showing yod instead of van in the last syllable. The verbal root is חָפַשׁ, and occurs once (Leviticus 19:20, with the Authorized Version rendering \"was free;\" in the same verse is also found a feminine noun derived from it, and rendered in the Authorized Version \"freedom\"). The adjective חָפְשִׁי occurs sixteen times, and is always rendered in the Authorized Version \"free,\" except once \"at liberty\" (Jeremiah 34:16). The \"freedom\" conveyed by the word is that of separation, in the use of it as found here. The leper and the house in which he lived were kept free from contact with others (Leviticus 13:46). Gesenius appears, however, to prefer the idea of \"infirmity,\" \"sickness,\" as determining the cast of the meaning of the word in our text, and goes so far as to translate it an \"hospital,\" quoting the word of Suidas, τὸ νοσοκομεῖον.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Isaiah the prophet. Isaiah the prophet asserts that his prophetic inspiration was in Uzziah's time (Isaiah 1:1; Isaiah 6:1), or we should have taken for granted that, as he was alive in the time of Hezekiah, grandson to Uzziah, he wrote of Uzziah only from hearsay and previous records. It must be concluded, accordingly, that Isaiah's inspiration as a prophet was early in his own life, that the beginning of it dated not long before the end of Uzziah's career, and that his life was a prolonged one, while still the most part of the acts first and last of Uzziah, which he wrote, must have consisted of a compilation from other treatises and perhaps partly from tradition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles26:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - In the field of the burial which belonged to the kings. The parallel simply says,\" with his fathers in the city of David.\" Judging, however, both from the somewhat remarkable words in our text, \"the field of the burial\" (i.e. the burial-field), and from the following clause, for they said, He is a leper, we may understand that, though it was in the \"city of David\" that he was buried, and \"with his fathers\" so far forth, and also that he lay near them, yet his actual sepulchre was not one with theirs, any more than his house of late had been one with the house he had known so well (see Condor's ' Handbook to the Bible,' p. 341).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

This word purports to render the Hebrew רַק, which might find a more telling reproduction in such a phrase as \"and moreover.\" It has been said, wherein his father did right, so did he; and to his clear advantage, where his father went wrong, he did riot. The people did yet corruptly. The parallel, in its ver. 35, specifies in what this consisted, viz. that they continued the high places, burning incense and sacrificing at them.

On the wall of Ophel; Hebrew, הָעפֶל; i.e. the ophel, which may be Englished \"the swelling ground.\" It was the extreme south end of the spur which gradually narrowed southward, and which was the continuation of the Bezetha hill, bounded by the brook Kedron on the east, and the Tyropceon on the west. This extreme south part called the Ophel sank into the bounding valleys to the Kedron precipitously and to the Tyropeon gradually. Pp. 328-335 of Condor's 'Handbook' (2nd edit.), and specially pp. 332-334, well repay a thorough study. A ditch was cut across the narrowest part of the ridge, which separated the temple hill itself from the Bezetha hill. In these parts fortifications were built, and no doubt to such it is our text calls attention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The mountains of Judah; Hebrew, בְּהַר; Revised Version, hill country of Judah, the Hebrew text being in the singular number (compare particularly Joshua 9:1, where the Har is evidently placed in contrast with the Shefelah).

No allusion is made to the matter of this verse in the parallel, which contains a statement of the Syrian Rezin's attack or threatened invasion of Judah; as well as Pekah's, son of Remaliah King of Israel. Of the Ammonites' defeat by Uzziah we have just heard (foregoing chapter, ver. 8). A general statement is all that is made there of the gifts or tribute, they then had to pay. The present tribute was a heavy payment, and enforced for three, years. The \"wheat\" and \"barley,\" in which payment was largely made bespeak the fertile arable quality of the Ammonite land, and this is noticed by travellers to the present day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The virtue of the reflection of this verse is apparent.

For the valley of the son of Hinnom, which curved round the south-west and west of Jerusalem (Ge Ben-Hinnom), see Conder's 'Handbook,' ch. 7. pp. 330-332. Burnt his children (see Leviticus 18:21); but there cannot be any doubt that Ahaz's practice here stated was an incident of the Moloch-superstition and horrible cruelty (see the parallel in its vers. 3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The King of Syria. The name of this king (Rezin) does not appear in this chapter, but it does in the parallel, vers. 5,6, 9. They smote him. A previous unsuccessful attempt of Rezin and Pekah is apparently passed over in our chapter (2 Kings 16:5), while the contents of our present yeas must be understood to have its place just before the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel, and to be significantly confirmed by the contents of its following verse. They smote... carried away... brought. These plurals strongly indicate the dialocation of sentences in compiled matter. They probably came from original sources, where the conjoined names of Rezin and Pekah had been the antecedents (see on this history, Isaiah 7, 8, 9.). Brought them to Damascus. The mode of the first introduction of the name of Ahaz in connection with Damascus in the parallel (ver. 10) is a suggestive illustration of how these parallel but very various narratives proffer to piece themselves, and in a wonderful manner clear their, whole subject of any possible taint of the \"cunningly devised fable.\" A great multitude of Judah's people had been carried captives and \"brought to Damascus.\" When the King of Assyria (parallel, ver. 9) came to the help of Ahaz, he struck a fierce and evidently decisive blow against Damascus and Rezin, and to Damascus,\" to meat\" Assyria's king, Tiglath-Pileser, the very next verso tells us, Ahaz. went - little doubt to pay his bills, over which a decent veil of silence is thrown. He was also delivered into the hand, etc. The form of this sentence, with its \"also,\" and with its evidently tacked-on appearance, coupled with the conjunction \"for\" with which the following verso is dragged in, seems to give great probability to the idea, first, that the latter half of ver. 5 and all of ver. 6 find their real place before (say) the word \"Damascus;\" and secondly, that they are strictly and conterminously paralleled by the former part of ver. 5 parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - (See foregoing note.) An hundred and twenty thousand. The number is large, but, the uncertainty of very many of these figures notwithstanding, it is impossible absolutely to pronounce it incredible. Because they had forsaken. The now frequent refrain of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The king's son. This can scarcely mean the child of Ahaz, considering Ahaz's age; some think a brother of the present king, son of Jotham, may be intended. We have also to fall back upon the use of the phrase, \"king's son,\" for some special official of the king or court (see note on 2 Chronicles 18:25; and its parallel, 1 Kings 22:26). The governor of the house; Revised Version, ruler. We have probably a sufficient clue to this designation in 1 Kings 4:6; and the designation itself, 2 Chronicles 18:3; 2 Kings 18:18; 2 Chronicles 19:11. Next to the king; Hebrew, מִשְׁנֵה הַמֶּלֶך; literally, therefore, the next of the king, the general meaning of which expression cannot be doubtful (comp. 1 Chronicles 16:5; Esther 10:3; Nehemiah 11:9), but the exacter scope and functions of the person under the kings of the divided kingdom thus designated is less certain. It is naturally to be supposed his place may have been king's deputy in councils in his absence, or in and over the city itself, when he was at a distance with an army.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - To Samaria. While the Syrian king carried his captives to Damascus (ver. 5), the Israel king carried his to Samaria. The numbers in this verse, with the added hundred and twenty thousand whom Pekah slew (ver. 6), may be compared with the military strength of the kingdom in Uzziah's time, as given in 2 Chronicles 26:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The very interesting contents of this and the following six verses are not found in the parallel. A prophet of the Lord... Oded. We do not know any particulars of this prophet; for his name and its possible identity with the name Iddo, see notes on 2 Chronicles 9:29; 15:1, 8. The growingly frequent references to the interposition of the prophets is much to be noticed, and their dignity, courage, fidelity, are brought into grand relief. They are very typical of the moral presence of which no national history, a.s centuries solemnly flow on, gives the slightest symptom of a slackening need. The very same may be said alike of the truth and those qualified and commissioned to bear it, of the message and the messenger. Before the host; i.e. in very face of the host, somewhat too mildly rendered \"to meet\" the host, in 2 Chronicles 15:2, etc. In a rage that reacheth up unto heaven. To the wonderful life of this figure, that must strike every reader, must be added the force that comes of its moral rather than merely material suggestion - a moral suggestion that reminds us of that of the sentence of far greater antiquity, and from the sacred lip of the Inspirer of all prophets, \"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.\" The rage had not been that on which the sun did not go down; it had been so fierce that upon it the sun ought never to have been required to look. See for interesting particulars and then more general references, Jeremiah 51:9; Ezra 9:6; Psalm 38:4; Genesis 18:21; Genesis 28:12; Job 20:6. The expression of the text, however, \"reach-eth,\" or \"toucheth,\" cannot be understood to reproduce as a perfect equivalent the older above-quoted one of \"crieth.\" In other words, the magnitude of the rage is the first thing set forth, and the particular language in which it is set forth well postulates the inference of its abominableness in God's sight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For bondmen and bondwomen unto you. The denunciation of Deuteronomy 28:68 may be instructively compared with the emphatic prohibition of Leviticus 25:46. The moral thread of ordinance that runs everywhere through the divinely established economy of the Old Testament Judaism should be devoutly observed. The verse, in the position of its words, furnishes an example of almost classical pattern: And now persons who are children of Judah and Jerusalem, ye are resolving within yourselves (literally, saying) to subdue into bondmen and bondwomen for yourselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The fierce wrath; i.e. not unannounced, for Oded means to say, \"You are doing contrary to the Law and the Prophet Moses,\" as just quoted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Oded's appeal, and forcible but most temperate and pertinent argument of the previous verses, was addressed to those who led the returning army, flushed with victory and haughty with their captives led in triumph, and, as ver. 15 shows, cruelly, and with every deprivation of clothes and of shoes, etc. It now, however, fortunately meets with most welcome practical support from those (certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim) who had not had a hand in what had been done, and now stood by, in some measure like umpires. They, at any rate, are convinced, partly perhaps in that their blood was not hot with the battles that had been. We do not know particulars of these four worthier men, whose names, with their fathers', are here \"expressed\" (ver. 15). They were evidently conscious of their past sins, had fear toward God, were not of those who, sinning, hastened to sin yet more; but they wished to flee from the wrath to come, the \"fierce wrath,\" already impending. Ephraim (see note on 2 Chronicles 25:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Hither. The returning army was, no doubt, on the outskirts of Samaria, though the exact site of this interesting scene is not written. For whereas we have offended against the Lord; Hebrew; לְאַשְׁמַת יְהוָהו עָלֵינוּ. Translate, For to the just cause of offence on the part of Jehovah with us, ye propose to add to our sins, and to the offence existing already with us; for great is that offence, etc. The genius of the word here rendered\" offence,\" seems, from careful comparison of the eighteen times of its occurrence, to point to \"guilt, sin,\" or \"trespass,\" as the causes awakening offence in any one against these who do them. The repentant temper of these \"heads of the children of Ephraim\" was admirable, and indicated their distance from many, many others of their people and day, and Of Judah, who were either callous or reckless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Before the princes and all the congregation; i.e. the four and those who were now congregated round them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The men which were expressed by name; Revised Version, which have been expressed by name. This is the probable, yet hardly certain, meaning of the clause. My name should be \"by names.\" And the meaning may be that \"the men who were now specified by names for the work rose up,\" etc. Under any aspect, it was likely enough these would embrace the four who had already spoken so piously and seasonably (2 Chronicles 31:19; 1 Chronicles 12:31; 1 Chronicles 16:41). The captives; Hebrew, שִׁבְיָה; literally, the captivity; i.e. of course, the body of captives (Deuteronomy 21:11; Deuteronomy 32:42). Clothed... arrayed. These two renderings are both the same verb (לָבַשׁ), and even the same (hiph.) conjugation. The undisguised, apparent repetition in the Hebrew text, veiled and disguised in both the Authorized and Revised Versions, may perhaps be owing to the intentness of the narrative on saying, first, that all who were literally naked were clothed from their own captive spoil; and then, secondly, that all whosoever (dusty, dirty, tired, footsore) were clothed, in the sense of being fresh dressed. The eleven particulars of this verso are uncommonly graphic in the Hebrew text brevity of description. The verse may read thus: And the men appointed by their names rose up, and took the captives by the hand, and all of the naked of them they dressed from the very spoil, and dressed them (all), and shod them, and fed them, and gave them drink, and anointed them, and carried upon asses all the feeble ones, and brought them to Jericho, city of palms, to the very side of their brethren, and... returned to Samaria. These made their own so far the blessedness of them of Matthew 25:34-36. Jericho; i.e. well within their own land, to a fertile and shaded spot of it, with plenty of water, and whence probably all might most easily wend their ways to their own district and town, Jericho lay on the border of Benjamin.

The vagueness of this common formula, \"at that time,\" would doubtless not have been apparent in the original sources. In the present instance we may fall back on our vers. 5, 6 to give it distinctness; but see vers. 5, 6, 7 of the parallel, which involve their own formula and the present in some little uncertainty.

These also had been subjugated again and again, and of late by Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6, 7), work that was now undone. The exultant relief to the Philistines, short-lived though it was, is referred to elsewhere, as in the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 14:29, 81), the Psalms (Palm 60:8). Beth-shemesh. On the border of Judah (2 Chronicles 25:23, and our note there; 1 Chronicles 6:44). Ajalon, This was also on the border (1 Chronicles 6:54; 2 Chronicles 11:10). Gederoth. This was in the Shefelah (Joshua 15:41). Shocho; or, Socho, one of Rehoboam's cities, near the Philistines, and therefore selected for fortification (2 Chronicles 11:7). Timnah. This bordered on Dan (Joshua 15:10). Gimzo. Not elsewhere mentioned, but well known in the modern village Jimzu, its site on what would have been the border of Dan. They dwelt there.

So Jehoshaphat was called in 2 Chronicles 21:2 \"King of Israel.\" If these two occasions are not merely cases of the writer's or of a copyist's easily imaginable mistake, they must be regarded as naming the king of the chief divided kingdom by the title of the whole kingdom or people. He made Judah naked; Revised Version, had dealt wantonly in Judah; or margin, Revised Version, had cast away restraint in Judah; Hebrew, הִפְרִיַע.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Tilgath-Pilneser (see 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26; 2 Kings 15:29; 2 Kings 16:10, our parallel. See our notes in full on 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26). Gesenius dates his reign as King of Assyria as B.C. 753-734; others as about B.C. 747-728. Distressed him, but strengthened him not. This is in our writer's usual deeper moral and religious vein, and was no doubt most true. For all Ahaz paid and bribed out of the sacrilegiously employed treasure of the temple, out of the depreciating and partial dismantling of \"the house of the king,\" and out of the begged contributions or taxes extortionately wrung \"of the princes\" (see the succinct account of next verse, and compare the parallel in its vers. 8, 18), he bought a master for himself, servitude, tributariness, and the humiliation of disgrace itself. The temporary relief he obtained (and which the writer of Chronicles in no way means to deny) from one enemy rivetted round his neck the yoke of another and greater. And worse than this, he secured in his own heart the greatest adversary of all - a restless, implacable foe, which ever goaded him on to worse folly and deeper sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Add to references of last verse 2 Chronicles 16:2; 2 Kings 12:18; 2 Kings 18:15.

The writer must be understood to speak from the point of view of Ahaz, in putting it, that it was the gods of Damascus who smote.\" The formula, all Israel, is a clear instance of how the name \"Israel\" is used as \"Judah.\" The gods of Damascus were, of course, the same with those of Syria, of which Damascus was capital. Their names were Rimmon, Tabrim-men, Hadad, and some others. Perhaps no verse in Chronicles is more typical of the special moral aspects and aims of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - This verse (completed, indeed, by the verse following) heightens to its climax the description of the guilt of Ahaz, which grew to madness. Vers. 17, 18 of the parallel enlarge our view of what Ahaz did in the way of destruction, relating his mutilation of the bases and laver and sea, after also the displacement of the brazen altar in favour of that the pattern of which he had sent from Damascus to Urijah the priest, who must have been a consenting party to the iniquity. Our 2 Chronicles 30:14 speaks of the time that came when these wicked steps of king and priest began to be retraced, and, with the previous verses of same chapter, are the sad but interesting reverse of the present passage.

This word, rendered here \"street,\" occurs forty-two times, and is always rendered by the same English word, except three times, when it appears as \"broad places,\" or \"ways.\" Probably it should always be translated thus, its meaning and its manifest preponderant use being \"an open space\" (2 Chronicles 32:6). So Revised Version: Into the broad place on the east, i.e. an open area east of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Sanctify... yourselves; Hebrew, הִתְקַדְּשׁוּ. Note the absence of any such direction in 1 Chronicles 13, and see 2 Chronicles 15:11-14, with our note on ver. 12 in particular. The filthiness; Hebrew, אֶת־הַגְּדִּה. This word occurs twenty-seven times, and is rendered \"separation\" fifteen times, \"flowers\" twice, \"put apart\" three times, \"uncleanness\" or \"filthiness\" six times, and \"menstruous\" once. The term, therefore, is among the strongest that could be used, and glances probably at the abominations, of whatsoever sort, that Ahaz's idolatries had entailed (comp. ver. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - This verse is the answering echo of 2 Chronicles 28:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Wherefore the wrath. As illustrated by the defeats and humiliations suffered at the hands of Pekah and Hazael, the Philistines and Edomites, and the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser. To trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing. Three words, carrying each a volume of meaning, and charged with the most powerful and painful of reminiscence (Deuteronomy 28:25, 28, 32 [observe our ver. 9], 37, 46, 65, 66). The Hebrew word for \"hissing\" (שְׁרֵקָה) occurs, besides, five times in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 19:8; 25:9, 18; 29:18; 51:37), and once in the contemporary Prophet Micah (Micah 6:16; comp. Jeremiah 26:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - (See 2 Chronicles 28:5, 8, 17.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - To make a covenant; Hebrew, לִכְרות בְּרְית (see 2 Chronicles 15:12, and our note there).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Be not now negligent; Hebrew, אַל־תִּשָּׂלוּ. This verb in kal (supposing it the same verb) occurs but five times (Job 3:26; Job 12:6; Psalm 122:6; Jeremiah 12:1; Lamentations 1:5), the radical idea of it being the safety of ease or security rather than any absolute safety. In niph. it is found only in this place and in 2 Kings 4:28, where the rendering of the Authorized Version, \"Do not deceive me,\" will easily yield the same essential idea. The derivative adjective (שֶׁלֵו) occurs eight times, and always has the same flavour about it (1 Chronicles 4:40; Job 16:12; Job 20:20; Job 21:23; Psalm 73:12; Jeremiah 49:31; Ezekiel 23:42; Zechariah 7:7). And the derivative nouns (שֶׁלֶו and שַׁלְוָה) occur nine times, and, at any rate, in almost every instance evidently carrying the same fundamental idea (Psalm 30:6; Psalm 122:7; Proverbs 1:32; Proverbs 17:1; Jeremiah 22:21; Ezekiel 16:49; Daniel 8:25; Daniel 11:21, 24). Our Authorized Version, therefore, sufficiently reproduces the thought of Hezekiah, though perhaps this would more exactly come out of the rendering, \"Be not now at ease,\" i.e. sacrifice ease and self-indulgence, etc. To serve him... that ye should minister. The same verb is used in both these places; so Revised Version, To minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Then the Levites arose. This verse gives two apiece of the three divisions or \"families\" - Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, \"sons of Levi\" (1 Chronicles 6:1, 2, 16-20; 1 Chronicles 23:6, 7, 12, 21, 24; comp. Genesis 46:11; Exodus 6:16). Though some of the names of this and the following two verses are known, they do not designate, of course, the same persons. Through many a generation of Levites, the same names were, no doubt intentionally, reproduced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Elizaphan (Exodus 6:22). He was chief of the Kohathites in the time of Moses (Numbers 3:30; comp. 1 Chronicles 15:8). This family, though we do not read why, seems always to have retained a separate existence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Asaph (former verse), Heman, Jeduthun. These were the chiefs of the singers and musicians (see, again, 1 Chronicles 6:31-33, 39; 1 Chronicles 25:1-7; 2 Chronicles 5:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - By the words of the Lord. The Hebrew here (בְּדִבְרֵי יְהוָה) may possibly mean, \"in the business of Jehovah,\" upon which King Hezekiah was now intent. But it is not by any means needful so to understand it. The words or commands of the Lord are such as are written in Exodus 19:22; Leviticus 11:44.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The inner part. That is to say, only the priests were warranted to enter inside the temple, while the Levites' sphere of work and service lay in the courts and round about the temple. Kidron, as we have seen (note 2 Chronicles 27:3), lay on the east of the temple mount.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They began... to sanctify. This is not the hithpael conjugation (ver. 5), and the whole verse probably purports to speak only of the sanctification of things, not of the self-sanctifying of the official persons, which, whether it occupied longer or shorter time, had been already done. The sanctifying of all outside, then, to the threshold, or porch, took eight days. So, manifestly, should be rendered, in the van here found, and. The sanctifying of the interior occupied another eight days, and the legitimate feast-day of the Passover, viz. the fourteenth day of Nisan, became overlapped by two days. Nevertheless, many may have observed the Passover on its strict date.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - This and the following verse purport to say that, while all \"filthiness\" had been swept out and away to Kidron's dark waters, all that had been polluted of the proper furniture of the temple and its worship had now been cleansed and sanctified by those who had been entrusted with the work, and likewise that things misplaced and removed had been replaced, also after cleansing and sanctifying. This is the happy report that the priests bring now to Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 28:24 2Kings 16:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The rulers of the city are its chief citizens - Hebrew, שָׂרֵי הָעִיר (2 Chronicles 24:17; 2 Chronicles 30:1-4) - who bring contributions of sacrificial victims, the word being generally rendered \"princes,\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - There is diversity of opinion, whether the seven bullocks (פָרִים), seven rams (אֵילִים), seven lambs (כְבָשִׁים) were burnt offering (עולָה), or, with the seven he-goats (צְפִירֵי עִזּים), were sin offering (חַטָּאת). Some think (as, for instance, Canon Rawlinson) that they were sin offering, as the account of the offering of them (ver. 22) takes priority for them over the he-goats; others (as Bertheau, Professor J. G. Murphy, etc.), that they were certainly burnt offering. It scarcely appears as though much stress can be laid upon what is apparently the chief reason of Canon Rawlinson's opinion, in face of the immediate language of the last sentence of our ver. 24, \"for the king commended the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.\" The fact of no mention of burnt offering in our present verse, and of the natural construction of the description, \"for a sin offering for the kingdom,\" etc., as applying to all that had preceded, seems the better argument, and all that is necessary, unless something moderately decisive be forthcoming to rebut it. The solution of all, however, is probably to our hand in Ezra 8:35, which is a very close and significant parallel to our present verse. The first mention of the sacrifice of פָרִים, or \"young bullocks\" is found in Exodus 24:5, and afterwards in Exodus 29:1, 3; Leviticus 4:3, etc.; Leviticus 8:2, 14, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of אֵילִים is Genesis 22:13; and, after, Exodus 29:15-18, 19-21, etc.; Leviticus 5:15; Leviticus 8:2, 22, etc. The first mention of the sacrifices of the כְבָשִׁים is Exodus 12:3-7, and, after, Exodus 29:38, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of צְפִירֵי עִזּים is the present passage; and, after, Ezra 8:25. But the mention of sacrifices of goats is found in Leviticus 1:10; Leviticus 3:12, and often besides. For the kingdom; i.e. probably for \"all that are in authority,\" viz. the king and rulers, the Hebrew word (מַמְלָכָה) designating here those exercising dominion (1 Kings 11:11; 1 Kings 14:8; 1 Samuel 28:17) rather than the country under dominion (Joshua 10:2; 1 Samuel 27:5). It is, however, possible that allusion to the whole kingdom of Judah and Israel is made here. For the sanctuary; i.e. those who officiated in holy things. For Judah; i.e. for all the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Received... sprinkled. The sprinkling of the blood marked the expiation (Leviticus 4:7, 18, 30; Leviticus 5:9; Leviticus 8:14, 15; Hebrews 9:12-14, 19-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The he-goats for the sin offering. No preposition \"for\" is found in the Hebrew text, and the previous noun is in the construct state, שְׂעַירֵי. Laid their hands. This signified the supposed laying of sins - the sins of the people - on the head of the animal (Leviticus 1:4; Leviticus 4:4, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar; Revised Version, and they made a sin offering with their blood. etc.; Hebrew, piel future of חָמָא. The piel conjugation occurs in all fourteen times - seven times rendered \"cleanse;\" twice, \"purify;\" twice, \"offer for sin;\" once, \"purge;\" once, as here, \"make reconciliation;\" and once (Genesis 31:39, \"I bare the loss of it\"), to \"bear loss.\" This last instance, being the very first occurrence of the word in this conjugation, beautifully harmonizes with the simple and most elementary idea of the doctrine or facts underlying the word. To make... atonement; Hebrew, לְכַפֵד, piel infinitive. This word, which in the one kal occurrence of it (Genesis 6:14) means \"to pitch, or cover with pitch,\" occurs in piel eighty-six times, and is rendered \"atone\" or \"make atonement\" sixty-six times, seven times \"reconcile\" or \"make reconciliation,\" the other renderings being such as \"pacify,\" \"purge,\" \"forgive,\" \"cleanse,\" \"be merciful,\" \"put it off,\" i.e. \"expiate\" (margin). We are so distinctly twice told that these sacrifices were for all Israel, that it may be taken for granted that the desire of Hezekiah was to include the northern kingdom - with which, under Hoshea, in subjection to the Assyrian king, times were now very hard and ominous of the end - in the benefits of the expiatory offerings now made (so see vers. 5, 6, 10-12 of next chapter).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - (See 1 Chronicles 16:4; 1 Chronicles 21; 1 Chronicles 23:5; 1 Chronicles 25:1, 6; 1 Chronicles 29:29; 2 Chronicles 5:12.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - To references of foregoing verse may be added Numbers 10:8; 1 Chronicles 15:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering. This verse and the following, with graphic brevity, purport to describe the actual consummating of the preparations rehearsed before, and, as seems most probable, in the significance of the last clause of Ezra 8:35, already referred to. The whole of the burnt offering was burnt on the altar, but of the sin offering the \"fat\" alone (Leviticus 4:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Bowed; Hebrew, כָּרְעוּ. Of the force and forcibleness of the verb here employed an idea may be obtained from comparison of Genesis 49:9; Numbers 24:9; Judges 5:27; Judges 7:6; 1 Kings 19:18. Worshipped; Hebrew, יִשְׁתַּחֲווּ. This verb, on the other hand, proclaims the force, not of the posture of the body merely, but rather of the mind, in the rising degrees of respect, reverence, allegiance, and the worship of profound adoration paid to him, who is \"God over all, blessed for evermore.\" The scene imaged in this description is indeed splint-stirring, in a high degree.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - With the words of David, and of Asaph. We can scarcely exclude from our thought the impression that loving human reverence for their own past religious helpers of song and music, and enthusiasm for the memory of them, were here glanced at. The king's and the princes supplementary (moreover) injunction and instruction to the Levites as to what words they should put on their lips. Asaph the seer. This is the only place in which Asaph is thus distinctly named seer, but it is contained virtually in 1 Chronicles 25:2; and for the substantive title given to two colleagues, see 1 Chronicles 25:5; 2 Chronicles 35:15. The princes (see their growing prominence in 2 Chronicles 24:17; 2 Chronicles 28:21; 2 Chronicles 30:2, 6, 12, 24; 2 Chronicles 32:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Ye have consecrated yourselves. The Hebrew text is (with the margin of both Authorized and Revised Versions), \"have filled your hands to Jehovah.\" Our somewhat awkward and somewhat misleading reproduction in English of the Hebrew text is, nevertheless, on the whole defensible. The phrase occurs some seventeen times (Exodus 28:41; Exodus 29:9, 29, 33, 35; Exodus 32:29; Leviticus 8:33; Leviticus 16:32; Leviticus 21:10; Numbers 3:3; Judges 17:5, 12; 1 Kings 13:33; 1 Chronicles 29:5; 2 Chronicles 13:9; Ezekiel 43:26), and in some of these instances is most conveniently represented by the rendering \"consecrate.\" The plural noun הַמִּלֻאִים, or חַמִּלוּאִיִם, is found thirteen times, in three of which places it is spoken of \"stones to be set,\" as e.g. \"for\" or \"in the ephod\" (Exodus 25:7; Exodus 35:9, 27; 1 Chronicles 29:2); and in the other ten, of \"consecration,\" as e.g. \"a ram of consecration,\" \"the ram of Aaron's consecration\" (Exodus 29:22, 26, 27, 31, 34; Leviticus 7:37; Leviticus 8:22, 28, 29, 31, 33). Some think our text, \"Now ye have consecrated yourselves,\" glances at the sacrifices of a propitiatory sort, which had just been completed; others, that the reference is by anticipation - to the fact that the people invited to draw near had, in an honourable, holy, and sincerely devoted way, armed themselves with worthy offerings. The sacrifices and thank offerings were sacrifices \"of thank offerings,\" in the nature of the peace offerings (Leviticus 7:11-21, 29-36). The burnt offerings marked the \"free heart,\" inasmuch as there was nothing of them reserved from the consuming of the altar for use. As many as were of a free heart; Hebrew, וְכָל־נְרִיב לֵב. Among some sixty occurrences of this word, in its verb, noun, or (as hero) adjective form, perhaps the most touching and beautifully expressive is that of Psalm 60:12, \"Uphold me with thy free Spirit.\" Sacrifices; Hebrew, זְבָחִים. This is the plural of זֶבַח- a word that expresses the generic idea, as e.g. the feast of sacrifice; again, the act of slaying and sacrificing a victim; again, the victim itself; again, those kinds of sacrifices that were expiatory or eucharistic, but not holocaustic (Leviticus 7:12). Thank offerings; Hebrew, תּודות. This word occurs about thirty-two times; in about two-thirds of that number denoting the spiritual acts of giving of thanks, even when accompanied by the figurative idea of \"sacrifices\" (Psalm 56:13; Psalm 107:22; Psalm 116:17), the genuine adoring praise or thanksgiving constituting the sacrifice; and in the other third denoting strictly sacrificial offerings, as several times in Leviticus (Leviticus 7:12; 22:29) and here. Our 2 Chronicles 33:16 classifies these with \"peace offerings\" (שְׁלָמִים), as do many other passages with \"burnt offerings\" generally (Judges 20:26; Judges 21:4; 1 Samuel 13:9; 2 Samuel 6:17; 1 Chronicles 16:1; 1 Chronicles 21:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - This verse manifestly purports to gauge in some degree the amount of free. heartedness present in the nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The consecrated things; Hebrew, הַקָּדַשִׁים. Not the word just discussed in ver. 31; these are the thank offering sacrifices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Originally, the worshipper who was moved to sacrifice was enjoined to slay, flay, and cut in pieces the victim (Leviticus 1:2-6). Later the Levites performed these duties, and on great public occasions, at any rate, the priests themselves. The simple tale of this verse speaks volumes of the state of the ecclesiastical profession and of the ecclesiastical heart at this very time. Into the dishonoured sepulchre already two or three unsuspected and apparently unacknowledged chinks had let in reproving light as to this, and very lately the almost unavoidable inferences respecting Urijah (see note on our ver. 1, and on 2 Chronicles 28:24, compared with 2 Kings 16:10-16) served the same purpose. How true to nature and to history, both secular and ecclesiastical also, the superiority, in sincerity and life and preparation for work, of the subordinates (the Levites), to those who fed on dignity rather than maintained it, in the highest sense, by religious life and conscientious practice!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And the drink offerings for every burnt offering. The \"drink offerings\" (גֻסָכִים) have not been mentioned before in this chapter. Of these libations of wine and oil, the most particular account is given in Numbers 15:5-10, 24). The first scriptural mention of them occurs in Genesis 35:14; followed by Exodus 29:40, 41; Exodus 30:9; Leviticus 23:13, 18, 37; Numbers 6:15, 17, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles29:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - (Comp.

Determined. The Hebrew word is the ordinary word for \"said;\" as, e.g., in the expression of such frequent occurrence, \"The Lord said.\" Its natural equivalent here might be, he gave the word, or issued the command, for the building of a house. For the Name of the Lord; better, to the Name of the Lord (1 Kings 5:3; or in Hebrew text, 5:18; 1 Chronicles 22:7). The expression,\" the Name of the Lord,\" is of very early date (Genesis 4:26). A name named upon a person at the first purported as far as possible to mark his nature, either its tout ensemble or some striking attribute of it. Hence the changed name, sometimes of Divine interposition (Genesis 17:5, 15; Genesis 32:28; Genesis 35:10); and much more noticeably the alterations of the Divine Name, to serve and to mark the progressive development of the revelation of God to man (Genesis 17:1; Exodus 3:14; Exodus 6:3; Exodus 34:14). So the Name of the Lord stands ever - monogram most sacred - for himself. A house for his kingdom; i.e. a royal residence for Solomon himself. This is mere clearly expressed as, \"in his own house\" (2 Chronicles 7:11; 2 Chronicles 8:1; 1 Kings 9:10, 15). The description of this house for himself is given in 1 Kings 7:1-13. But no parallel account exists in Chronicles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The presence of this verse here, and the composition of it, may probably mark some corruptness of text or error of copyists, as the first two words of it are the proper first two words of ver. 17, and the remainder of it shows the proper contents of ver. 18, which are not only in other aspects apparently in the right place there, but also by analogy of the parallel (1 Kings 5:15, 16). The contents of this verse will therefore be considered with vers. 17, 18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Huram. So the name is spelt, whether of Tyrian king or Tyrian workman, in Chronicles, except, perhaps, in 1 Chronicles 14:1. Elsewhere the name is written הִירָם, or sometimes חִירום, instead of חוּרָם. Geseuius draws attention to Josephus's Greek rendering of the name, Αἵρωμος, with whom agree Menander, an historian of Ephesus, in a fragment respecting Hiram (Josephus, 'Contra Apion,' 1:18); and Dius, a fragment of whose history of the Phoenicians telling of Solomon and Hiram, Josephus also is the means of preserving ('Contra Apion,' 1:17). The Septuagint write the name Ξιράμ; the Alexandrian, Ξειράμ; the Vulgate, Hiram. The name of Hiram's father was Abibaal. Hiram himself began to reign, according to Menander, when nineteen years of age, reigned thirty-four years (B.C. 1023-990), and died therefore at the age of fifty-three. Of Hiram and his reign in Tyre very little is known beyond what is so familiar to us from the Bible history of David and Solomon. The city of Tyre is among the most ancient. Though it is not mentioned in Homer, yet the Sidonians, who lived in such close connection with the Tyrians, are mentioned there ('Iliad.,' 6:290; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:84; 22:424), whilst Virgil calls Tyre the Sidonian city, Sidon being twenty miles distant ('AEn.,' 1:12, 677; 4:545). The modern name of Tyre is Sur. The city was situate on the east coast of the Mediterranean, in Phoenicia, about seventy-four geographical miles north of Joppa, while the road distance from Joppa to Jerusalem was thirty-two miles. The first Bible mention of Tyre is in Joshua 19:29. After that the more characteristic mentions of it are 2 Samuel 5:11, with all its parallels; 2 Samuel 24:7; Isaiah 23:1, 7; Ezekiel 26:2; Ezekiel 27:1-8; Zechariah 9:2, 3. Tyre was celebrated for its working in copper and brass, and by no means only for its cedar and timber felling. The good terms and intimacy subsisting between Solomon and the King of Tyre speak themselves very plainly in Bible history, without leaving us dependent on doubtful history, or tales of such as Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:05. § 3; 'Contra Apion,' 1:17). For the timber, metals, workmen, given by Hiram to Solomon, Solomon gave to Hiram corn and oil, ceded to him some cities, and the use of some ports on the Red Sea (1 Kings 9:11-14, 25-28; 1 Kings 10:21-23. See also 1 Kings 16:31). As thou didst deal with David... and didst send him cedars. To this vers. 7 and 8 are the apodosis manifestly, while vers. 4, 5, 6 should be enclosed in brackets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In the nine headings contained in this verse we may consider that the leading religious observances and services of the nation are summarized. To dedicate it. The more frequent rendering of the Hebrew word here used is \"to hallow,\" Or \"to sanctify.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Sweet incense (see Exodus 30:1, 6-9, 34-38; Exodus 37:25-29; Psalm 141:2; Revelation 5:8; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 8:3-5). This sweet incense, compounded of the four ingredients stacte, onycha, galbanum, pure frankincense, was to be burnt morning and evening, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifices on the altar made of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, which stood in the holy place facing the ark. with the table of shewbread on the one hand, and the golden candlestick on the other. While the act of atonement was set forth by the offering of the victim on the brazen altar in the outer court, the ascending, acceptable, and accepted prayer and aspiration of the congregation were expressed by the sweet incense-burning.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The continual shew-bread (מַעֲרֶכֶת תָּמִיד). The elementary meaning of the word here rendered \"shewbread\" is \"a ranging in order,\" whether the \"order\" might be, e.g., that of an army in battle array (1 Samuel 4:16; 1 Samuel 17:8; 2 Samuel 22:48), or of the lamps of the holy candlestick (Exodus 39:37), or of pilings of wood to be burnt on the altar (Judges 6:26), or of cakes of bread, as presumably 'here and in some parallel passages (Leviticus 24:6). For the table which was to carry these cakes, see Exodus 25:23-30; Exodus 37:10-16; the last verse of the former passage speaking of the shewbread under the name לֶחֶם פָנִים. (For the position of the table, see Exodus 26:35.) The word employed in the text is first used to express the piles of cakes, called in our Authorized Version shewbread in Leviticus 24:6, 7; then 1 Chronicles 9:32; 1 Chronicles 23:29; 1 Chronicles 28:16; as also again in 2 Chronicles 13:11; 2 Chronicles 29:18; and in Nehemiah 10:33. Where in these passages the word לֶחֶם is not expressed, that it is understood may be gathered from the other passages (Numbers 4:7). The bread consisted of twelve large cakes of unleavened dough (Leviticus 24:5-9), ranged in two heaps, and with a golden cup of frankincense (Leviticus 24:7) to each pile. When on every seventh day new cakes were substituted, the old ones belonged to the priests (Leviticus 24:8, 9; Leviticus 8:31; Matthew 12:4; Exodus 29:33, 34). The twelve cakes pointed to the twelve tribes. Their size may be judged from the statement that each cake contained two tenth deals, i.e. two-tenths of an ephah, equal to about six pounds and a quarter. The exact significance of this bread is not stated in Scripture. Part of it lay plainly in the twelve cakes, part, perhaps, in their becoming priest's food, found by the people (Leviticus 24:8), after having been presented seven days before the Lord. Much that is interesting but not finally satisfactory on the question may be found in the article \"Shewbread\" in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1271. Our Authorized Version \"shewbread' comes from Luther's Schaubrode. Wickliffe, after the Vulgate panes propositionis, designates it \"the loaves of proposition.\" The New Testament has, in Hebrews 9:2, ἡ προθέσις τῶν ἄρτῶν; as also in the Gospels (Matthew 12:4; Luke 6:4); while the Septuagint has ἄρτοι ἐνώπιοι (Exodus 25:30), and ἄρτοι τῆς προσφορᾶς (1 Kings 7:48). The question really turns on the significance of the designation of Exodus 25:30 (לֶחֶם פָּנִים).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The burnt offerings morning and evening. A succinct statement of these offerings, constituting the \"daily offering,\" is given in Numbers 28:3-8, according to its original institution (Exodus 29:38-42), except in the added mention of the \"strong wine,\" or strong drink, spoken of in the latter part of ver. 7, which had probably originated as an incident of the wilderness-journey. The morning and evening offering were alike, viz. a lamb, a meal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of flour, mixed with the fourth part of a bin of beaten oil, and a drink offering consisting of the fourth part of a bin of \"wine,\" or of \"strong drink.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The burnt offering on the sabbath. The account of this is given in Numbers 28:9, 10; and any previous institution of it is not recorded. The sabbath-day burnt offerings were the double of the daily offerings (Ezekiel 46:4).NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The burnt offering on the new moons; see Numbers 27:11-15, where the phrase, of your months,\" is what is \"the beginnings of your months\" is what is employed, i.e. the first day of each month (Leviticus 10:10). No previous mention of this burnt offering is found. It consisted of two bullocks, one ram, seven lambs,NEWLINENEWLINE(a) with meat offering consisting of three-tenths of an ephah of flour mixed with oil for each bullock; two-tenths of an ephah of flour mixed with oil for the ram; one-tenth of an ephah of flour similarly mixed for each lamb;NEWLINENEWLINE(b) with drink offering, of half a hin of wine to each bullock; the third part of a hin to the ram; and the fourth part of a hin to each lamb. A kid of the goats for a sin offering, which in fact was offered before the burnt offering. And all these were to be additional to the continual offering of the day, with its drink offering (see also Isaiah 66:23; Ezekiel 46:3; Amos 8:5).NEWLINENEWLINE(6) The burnt offering on the solemn feasts of the Lord. These were the three great festivals of the year - the Passover (Exodus 12:3-20, 27, 43; Leviticus 23:4-8; Deuteronomy 16:1-8); the Feast of Weeks (Exodus 23:16; Exodus 34:22; Leviticus 23. 15-21; Numbers 28:26; Deuteronomy 16:8-12); the Feast of Tabernacles (Exodus 23:16; Leviticus 23:33-44; Numbers 29:13-40; Deuteronomy 16:13-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - The contents of these verses beg some special observation, in the first place, as having been judged by the writer of Chronicles matter desirable to be retained and put in his work. To find a place for this subject amid his careful selection, and rejection in many cases, of the matter at his command, is certainly a decision in harmony with his general design in this work. Then, again, they may be remarked on as spoken to another king, who, whether it were to be expected or no, was, it is plain, a sympathizing hearer of the piety and religious resolution of Solomon (ver. 12). This is one of the touches of history that does not diminish our regret that we do not know more of Hiram. He was no \"proselyte,\" but he had the sympathy of a convert to the religion of the Jew. Perhaps the simplest and most natural explanation may just be the truest, that Hiram for some long time had seen \"the rising\" kingdom, and alike in David and Solomon in turn, \"the coming\" men. He had been more calmly and deliberately impressed than the Queen of Sheba afterwards, but not less effectually and operatively impressed. And once more the passage is noteworthy for the utterances of Solomon in themselves. As parenthetically testifying to a powerful man, who could be a powerful helper of Solomon's enterprise, his outburst of explanation, and of ardent religious purpose, and of humble godly awe, is natural. But that he should call the temple he purposed to build \"so great,\" as we cannot put it down either to intentional exaggeration or to sober historic fact, must the rather be honestly set down to such considerations as these, viz. that in point of fact, neither David nor Solomon were \"travelled men,\" as Joseph and Moses, for instance. Their measures of greatness were largely dependent upon the existing material and furnishing of their own little country. And further, Solomon speaks of the temple as great very probably from the point of view of its simple religious uses (note end of ver. 6) as the place of sacrifice in especial rather than as a place, for instance, of vast congregations and vast processions. Then, too, as compared with the tabernacle, it would loom \"great,\" whether for size or for its enduring material. Meantime, though Solomon does indeed use the words (ver. 5),\" The house.., is great,\" yet, throwing on the words the light of the remaining clause of the verse, and of David's words in 1 Chronicles 29:1, it is not very certain that the main thing present to his mind was not the size, but rather the character of the house, and the solemn character of the enterprise itself (1 Kings 8:27; 2 Chronicles 6:18). Who am I... save only to burn sacrifice before him? The drift of Solomon's thought is plain - that nothing would justify mortal man, if he purported to build really a palace of residence for him whom the heaven of heavens could not contain, but that he is justified all the more in \"not giving sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he had found out a place\" (Psalm 132:4, 5) where man might acceptably, in God's appointed way, draw near to him. If \"earth draw near to heaven,\" it may be confidently depended on that heaven will not be slow to bend down its glory, majesty, grace, to earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Send me... a man cunning to work, etc. The parenthesis is now ended. By comparison of ver. 3, it appears that Solomon makes of Hiram's services to David his father a very plea why his own requests addressed now to Hiram should be granted. If we may be guided by the form of the expressions used in 1 Chronicles 14:1 and 2 Samuel 5:11, 12, Hiram had in the first instance volunteered help to David, and had not waited to be applied to by David. This would show us more clearly the force of Solomon's plea. Further, if we note the language of 1 Kings 5:1, we may be disposed to think that it fills a gap in our present connection, and indicates that, though Solomon appears here to have had to take the initiative, an easy opportunity was opened, in the courteous embassy sent him in the persons of Hiram's \"servants.\" That the king of this most privileged, separate, and exclusive people of Israel (and he the one who conducted that people to the very zenith of their fame) should have to apply and be permitted to apply to foreign and, so to say, heathen help, in so intrinsic a matter as the finding of the \"cunning\" and the \"skill\" of head and hand for the most sacred and distinctive chef d'oeuvre of the said exclusive nation, is a grand instance of nature breaking all trammels, even when most divinely purposed, and a grand token of the dawning comity of nations, of free-trade under the unlikeliest auspices, and of the brotherhood of humanity, never more broadly illustrated than when on an international scale. The competence of the Phoenicians and the people of Sidon and those over whom Hiram immediately reigned in the working of the metals, and furthermore in a very wide range of other subjects, is well sustained by the allusions of very various authorities (already instanced under 1 Chronicles 14:1, and passim; Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:289-294; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:614; 15:415-426; Herod., 3:19; 7:23, 44, 96; Strabo, 16:2. § 23). The man who was sent is described in vers. 13, 14, infra, as also 1 Kings 7:13, 14. Purple, ... crimson, ... blue. It is not absolutely necessary to suppose that the same Hiram, so skilled in working of gold, silver, brass, and iron, was the authority sent for these matters of various coloured dyes for the cloths that would later on be required for curtains and other similar purposes in the temple. So far, indeed, as the literal construction of the words go, this would seem to be what is meant, and no doubt may have been the case, though unlikely. The purple (אַדְגְּוָן). A Chaldee form of this word (אַרְגְּוָנָא) occurs three times in Daniel 5:7, 16, 29, and appears in each of those cases in our Authorized Version as \"scarlet.\" Neither of these words is the word used in the numerous passages of Exodus, Numbers, Judges, Esther, Proverbs, Canticles, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, nor, indeed, in ver. 13, infra and 2 Chronicles 3:14. In all these places, numbering nearly forty, the word is אַרְגָבָן. The purple was probably obtained from some shell-fish on the coast of the Mediterranean. The crimson (כַרְמִיל). Gesenius says that this was a colour obtained from multitudinous insects that tenanted one kind of the flex (Coccus ilicis), and that the word is from the Persian language. The Persian kerm, Sanscrit krimi, Armenian karmir, German carmesin, and our own \"crimson,\" keep the same framework of letters or sound to a remarkable degree. This word is found only here, ver. 13, infra, and 2 Chronicles 3:14. The crimson of Isaiah 1:18 and Jeremiah 4:30, and the scarlet of some forty places in the Pentateuch and other books, come as the rendering of the word שָׁנִי. The blue (תְּכֵלֶת). This is the same word as is used in some fifty other passages in Exodus, Numbers, and in later books. This colour was obtained from a shell-fish (Helix ianthina) found in the Mediterranean, the shell of which was blue. Can skill to grave. The word \"to grave\" is the piel conjugation of the very familiar Hebrew verb פָּתַח, \"to open.\" Out of twenty-nine times that the verb occurs in some part of the piel conjugation, it is translated \"grave\" nine times, \"loosed\" eleven times, \"put off\" twice, \"ungirded\" once, \"opened\" four times, \"appear\" once, and \"go free\" once. Perhaps the \"opening\" the ground with the plough (Isaiah 28:24) leads most easily on to the idea of \"engraving.\" Cunning men whom... David... did provide, As we read in 1 Chronicles 22:15; 1 Chronicles 28:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Algum trees, out of Lebanon. These trees are called algum in the three passages of Chronicles in which the tree is mentioned, viz. here and 2 Chronicles 9:10, 11, but in the three passages of Kings, almug, viz. 1 Kings 10:11, 12 bis. As we read in 1 Kings 10:11; 2 Chronicles 9:10, 11, that they were exports from Ophir, we are arrested by the expression, \"out of Lebanon,\" here. If they were accessible in Lebanon, it is not on the face of it to be supposed they would be ordered from such a distance as Ophir. Lastly, there is very great difference of opinion as to what the tree was in itself. In Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. 3. appendix, p. 6, the subject is discussed more fully than it can be here, and with some of its scientific technicalities. Celsius has mentioned fifteen woods for which the honour has been claimed. More modern disputants have suggested five, of these the red sandalwood being considered, perhaps, the likeliest. So great an authority as Dr. Hooker pronounces that it is a question quite undetermined. But inasmuch as it is so undetermined, it would seem possible that, if it were a precious wood of the smaller kind (as e.g. ebony with us), and, so to say, of shy growth in Lebanon, it might be that it did grow in Lebanon, but that a very insufficient supply of it there was customarily supplemented by the imports received from Ophir. Or, again, it may be that the words, \"out of Lebanon,\" are simply misplaced (1 Kings 5:8), and should follow the words, \"fir trees.\" The rendering \"pillars\" in 1 Kings 10:12 for \"rails\" or \"props\" is unfortunate, as the other quoted uses of the wood for \"harps\" and \"psalteries\" would all betoken a small as well as very hard wood. Lastly, it is a suggestion of Canon Rawlinson that, inasmuch as the almug wood of Ophir came via Phoenicia and Hiram, Solomon may very possibly have been ignorant that \"Lebanon\" was not its proper habitat. Thy servants can skill to cut timber. This same testimony is expressed yet more strongly in 1 Kings 5:6, \"There is not any among us that can skill to hew timber like the Sidoniaus.\" Passages like 2 Kings 19:23; Isaiah 14:8; Isaiah 37:24, go to show that the verb employed in our text is rightly rendered \"hew,\" as referring to the felling rather than to any subsequent dressing and sawing up of the timber. It is, therefore, rather more a point of interest to learn in what the great skill consisted which so threw Israelites into the shade, while distinguishing Hiram's servants. It is, of course, quite possible that the \"hewing,\" or \"felling,\" may be taken to infer all the subsequent cutting, dressing, etc. Perhaps the skill intended will have included the best selection of trees, as well as the neatest and quickest laying of them prostrate, and if beyond this it included the sawing and dressing and shaping of the wood, the room for superiority of skill would be ample.

In 1 Kings 5:11 the language is \"wheat for food\" (מַכֹּלֶת), while the Septuagint gives καὶ μαχεὶρ. In our present passage the Septuagint gives εἰς βρώματα, suggesting at once that our Hebrew מִכּות is an error for מַכֹּלֶת. The former Hebrew word is that constantly employed for \"plagues,\" \"strokes,\" etc., and it is nowhere but in this place rendered \"beaten.\" I will give to thy servants. This passage is hard to reconcile with what is said in 1 Kings 5:11; but meantime it is not certain that it needs to be reconciled with it. It is possible that the two passages are distinct. The contents of the present verse, at all events, need not be credited with any ambiguity, unless, indeed, we would wish it more definite, whether the expression, \"I will give to thy servants,\" may not be quite as correctly understood, \"for thy servants,\" i.e. to thee as the hire of them. If this be so, it would enable us to give at once all the wheat, and two hundred out of the 20,000 baths of oil, for the consumption, not of the literal workmen, but of the royal household. Then this granted, the verse, though not identical with 1 Kings 5:11, is brought into harmony with it. Reverting to the statement in 1 Kings 5, what we learn is that Solomon, in his application to Hiram, offers payment for the hire of his servants such as he shall appoint (ver. 6). Hiram's reply is that he shall be satisfied to receive as payment \"food for his household\" (ver. 9), the amount of it and the annual payment of it being specified in ver. 11. This is the whole case, the discrepancies in which are plain, but they do not amount to contradictions. The appearance that is worn on the face of things is that the writer in Chronicles gives what came to be the final arrangement as to remuneration, though confessedly it is placed as much as the account in Kings in the draft of Solomon's original application to Hiram. Measures. These were cots, and the cot was the same as the homer. From a calculation of some doubtfulness, however, made under the suggestions of 1 Kings 4:22, it has been said that the consumption of the royal household of Solomon was above 32,000 measures. The cor, or homer, was the largest of the five dry measures of capacity, being equal to 180 cabs, 100 omers, 30 seahe, 10 ephahs (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3.1741), though what was the exact value of any one of these in modern measures has only been uncertainly and very approximately arrived at. Baths. The bath was the largest of the three liquid measures of capacity, being equal to 6 bins and 72 logs (see same 'Dictionary,' 3:1740).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Huram... answered in writing. It is impossible to argue with any but superficial plausibility that Solomon had not used writing. In the parallel of Kings an identical expression is used for the communications of both: \"Solomon sent to Hiram\" (ver. 2), and \"Hiram sent to Solomon\" (ver. 8). The productions of the forms of this correspondence by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:2)and Eupolemus ('Ap. Praep. Evang.,' 9:33) are, of course, merely mythical. Because the Lord hath loved his people. This beautiful expression has parallels, not only in such passages as 2 Chronicles 9:8; 1 Kings 10:9; but in such as Deuteronomy 7:13; Deuteronomy 10:15; Psalm 47:4; Psalm 115:12; Jeremiah 31:3; Hosea 11:1, 4. These were all precursors of the fuller assertion and kinder demonstration of God's love repeated so often and in such tender connections in the Epistles of the New Testament. This verse and the following are also testimony to the indirect influences on surrounding nations of the knowledge of the one true Creator-God and Ruler-God, that was domiciled by special revelation and oracle (Romans 3:2) with Israel. Where nations near were bitter foes, they often feared Israel's God, whereas now they were friends they could summon to their lips the highest of the outbursts of praise, not to say of adoration. The very noteworthy sympathy of Hiram with Israel may have owed something to his personal predilection for David (1 Kings 5:1). And this again is convincing testimony to the worth and usefulness of individual character which here influenced the destiny of two whole nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHuram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Of Huram my father's. The words of 2 Chronicles 4:11, 16 would invest these with suspicion, if nothing that occurred before did, as e.g. the parallel passage (1 Kings 7:13, 14, 40). There can be no doubt from these passages that the name Huram of this verse is the name of the workman sent (the lamed prefixed being only the objective sign), not the supposed name of King Hiram's father, which, as already seen, was Abibaal. But the following word translated \"my father\" (אָבִי) is less easily explained; 2 Chronicles 4:16 (\"his father\") is quite sufficient to negative the rendering\" father\" altogether. In our text altogether inappropriate, it may be called there altogether impossible. It has been proposed to render it as a proper name Abi, or as an affix of honour, Ab, equal to \"master.\" However, Gesenius (in 'Lexicon,' sub roe. אב (6), which see) furnishes a signification, \"chief counsellor,\" which (taking it to mean chief counsellor, or as it were expert, chief referee, or even only foreman in such matters as might be in question) would well suit all the passages, and remove all difficulty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Son of a woman... of Dan. Both this and the parallel (1 Kings 7:14) agree as to the father of this very clever workman, that he was \"a man of Tyre.\" But the parallel gives the mother as a woman \"of the tribe of Naphtali,\" and calls her a \"widow.\" This must mean, either that she was a widow now, or that she was a widow when \"the man of Tyre\" married her. If this latter is the correct meaning, it has been suggested that, though the mother was really a woman of the daughters of Dan, yet the husband who, dying, left her a widow, was of the tribe of Naphtali, and that from this she became credited with belonging to that tribe. It would seem not altogether impossible that it may be intended to state, in a delicate way, that this remarkably able man was the natural son of the widow in question, \"the man of Tyre\" (not called her husband) being the father. On the intermarriages of Danites and Phoenicians, see Blunt's 'Coincidences,' pt. 2. 4. Skilful... to find out every device. (For the identical phrase, see Exodus 31:4.) The present verse, exceeding in definiteness ver. 7, supra, undoubtedly purports on the face of it to ascribe a very wide range of practical skill, and not merely general administrative and directing skill, to Hiram. Note, however, the significance couched in the last clauses of both verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The contents of this verse cannot be supposed to imply that King Hiram is eager for the pay to be remembered, but are equivalent to saying promptly that all things are ready to begin, and that therefore the commissariat must be ready also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Joppa, This was one of the most ancient of towns, and is referred to by Pliny ('Hist.

It is mentioned Joshua 19:46 as Japho, where also we learn the circumstances under which the Dan tribe were possessed of it. It is remarkable that it is not mentioned again till our present verse, not even in the parallel (1 Kings 5:9). But it appears again in Ezra 3:7; Jonah 1:3, and in several places in the Acts of the Apostles. The modern name of it is Joffa, and it is not reputed as a good port now. It was distant from Jerusalem some thirty-four miles. The carriage of the tim-bet this road-journey is nowhere described in detail, nor is the exact spot of the coast west of Lebanon mentioned where the flotes were made, and thence despatched.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Strangers. By these are meant those of the former inhabitants and possessors of the land, who had not been extirpated or driven out. Special regulations respecting them are recorded in Judges 1:21-28, 33-36. But these had largely lapsed till, as it appears, David revived them rather trenchantly, and David is now followed by Solomon (2 Chronicles 8:7, 8; 1 Kings 9:20, 21). The very much milder enforcement of labour upon the Israelites themselves is evident from 1 Kings 5:13-16. After the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them. Of this transaction on the part of David we do not possess any absolutely distinct statement. But the place of it is sufficiently evident, as indicated in 1 Chronicles 22:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Three thousand and six hundred. Adding to these the 250 of 2 Chronicles 8:10, infra, the total 3850 of 1 Kings 5:16 is exactly reached. That total, however, is reached by a somewhat different classification, the division being into 3300 \"strangers,\" and 500 \"chief of the officers\" (1 Kings 9:23). The explanation probably is that of the 3600 \"stranger\" overseers, the small proportion of 300 were of much higher grade in office than the rest, and were ranked by the writer in Kings with those overseers (250) of Solomon, who were probably Israelites.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Hezekiah sent... wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh. Some have sought to bring into the appearance of harmony the two first clauses of this verse by supposing that the former clause purports to say that Hezekiah sent messengers to all Israel and Judah, and in particular letters in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh, the chief tribes of the northern kingdom and the Joseph tribes. Vers. 6 and 10, however, seem to dispose effectually of this offer of explanation; while another explanation, that the names of the two tribes are simply to be taken as equivalent to \"all Israel,\" seems true, though, in fact, it may be to advance us no way at all. We should prefer in the difficulty, unimportant though it is, yet one facing us, rather to assume that the verse wishes to say that Hezekiah sent (i.e. sent messengers, which prove to be the runners, rendered the \"posts\") to all Israel and Judah, and to Ephraim, Manasseh, and the rest of their allied tribes by implication, but not to Judah wrote letters also which were carried by the posts (.or runners). It is true that ver. 6 may negative even this conjecture for getting over the difficulty, but not necessarily no, for it only says that the posts went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters, which they may be supposed to have dropped only to some, not to all, and those some Israel, or Ephraim, Manasseh, and brethren. There will have been to hand other, the usual methods of communication with Judah, from Jerusalem its metropolis, and from its king. The thing different from \"letters\" that was circulated may have been just the \"proclamation\" of ver. 5. It has been suggested that the now King of Israel, Hoshea, was very probably a captive of Assyria at this exact time (2 Kings 17:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This and the following verse are well explained by Numbers 9:6-13, where the particular instance of the \"defilement by a dead body\" simply exemplified other legitimate instances of defilement or non-sanctification (2 Chronicles 29:5, 15, 34), and where absence on a journey similarly exemplified other unavoidable absence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - At that time. The words seem like a reminiscence of the \"at that day,\" twice occurring in ver. 6 of Numbers 9. But anyway the meaning is plain \"at the appointed season.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - This verse betokens the careful consideration on the part of \"king, princes, and all the congregation,\" that had been given to the distinct question, whether the exact present circumstances legitimately fell under the description of Numbers 9:6-13; and the issue was that they decided that they did, they \"ruled the thing right\" (וַיִּישַׁר הַדָבָר)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Of a long time. Though the idea expressed in this rendering must, under any circumstances, attach to this passage, yet it can scarcely be understood to be given in the one Hebrew word we have here (לָרֹב); out of nearly a hundred and fifty occurrences of the word, and often with its present preposition, this is the solitary occasion of its being turned into a mark of time. The translation should read, for they had not kept it in multitude, i.e. in proper multitudes, and in the multitude of an undivided and holy kingdom. The force of the reference lies in the fact just stated, that Hezekiah, ignoring all the worse precedents of now many generations, and ignoring the iniquity of the duality of the kingdom, manfully caused his writ to run from south to north unchecked! As it was written; i.e. in the book of the Law of Moses. So runs the full and frequent and honoured phrase: כַּכָּתוּב בְסֵפֶר תּורַת־משֶׁה (2 Kings 14:6; 1 Kings 2:3; Joshua 3:34; 2 Chronicles 35:26, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - So the posts (see note on ver. 1). The remnant of you... escaped... of Assyria. Hezekiah had, no doubt, already made his account with the fact that the injured and crushed state of the northern kingdom might be of salutary omen for the attempt on his part to bring them to a sense of their past sins, specially perhaps of omission. Of the calamities of Israel, and their captivity in large part, and in the rest subjection by tribute to Assyria, there is clear testimony in 2 Kings 15:29; 2 Kings 17:1-6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - A strange and significant snatch of corroborating history is to be found in 1 Chronicles 5:23-26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Be ye not stiff-necked (see Deuteronomy 16, 17). Yield yourselves; literally, give the hand (see 1 Chronicles 29:24; Ezra 10:19, etc.). Which he hath sanctified for ever (see Psalm 132:13, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Through... Ephraim and Manasseh. The way in which the names of these two tribes are here used may explain in part the use of them in brief for simple reasons of the convenience of brevity in ver. 1. They laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. These two words speak significant description of the exact moral state in which Israel's tribes were now to be found. Even unto Zebulun. What of the country lay north of Zebulun had been so wasted by Assyria that practically Zebulnn is spoken of as what was most northerly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Adding the tribes of Ephraim and Issachar mentioned in ver. 18, and bearing in mind the contents of our ver. 7 (with note), we have really only to account for Dan, which was no longer classed with Israel, and Naphtali and Simeon. The probable significance of the passage is not to lay stress upon the tribes represented, but on the scattered, though sparse, attendants at the Passover who came.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Also in Judah the hand of God was. Considering the difference of preposition, this expression can perhaps scarcely cite as its parallel Ezra 7:9. \"The hand of God\" here means rather his effectual working, which effectual working produced a hearty unanimity, that contrasted well with the bearing of the northern tribes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This verse purports to say that the total, at any rate, of the attendance on the Passover was very large.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Took away the altars... the brook Kidron (see 2 Chronicles 28:24; 2 Chronicles 29:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Were ashamed; Hebrew, גִכְלְמוּ. This word, occurring in one conjugation or another thirty-eight times, expresses in every instance a genuine shame. It now was the forerunner of a practical repenting. And brought in... into; better rendered, and carried up to the house of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They stood in their place after their manner (see Leviticus 1:11-13, and many other references in Leviticus).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Therefore the Levites had the charge (see Leviticus 1, etc., which repeatedly affirms that the original directions of Moses were that the person who brought the victim to offer it was to slay it, and to bring the blood).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.

The Hebrew word here is the strict word for physical healing, and is a slight but significant indication of the reality of the spiritual view contemplated in Moses' Law in this matter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - See Exodus 12:18, and many repetitions of the same matter, respecting the duration of the Passover and eating of unleavened bread. With loud instruments. Some render this, \"instruments ascribing might to Jehovah.\" There seems no necessity for this; and the plain Hebrew text is \"instruments of might,\" i.e. strong or loud instruments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Spake comfortably; literally, to the heart of, etc. That taught the good knowledge. This rendering is in some error, and is awkward in not indicating the direction of the knowledge. A better rendering (see Revised Version) will be, who were well skilled in rendering such service to Jehovah. And perhaps the simplest rendering, \"who served with good service to Jehovah,\" will be the most correct to the real meaning of the Hebrew text (Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 13:15). Making confession; i.e. the confession or uttering forth of praise (so Psalm 75:2; Psalm 92:1; 1 Chronicles 16:4, 7, 35, 41; 1 Chronicles 23:30; 1 Chronicles 25:3; 2 Chronicles 5:13; 2 Chronicles 7:3, 6; 2 Chronicles 31:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - This and the following verso should read as one. Hezekiah no doubt wished, by prolonging the feast and the joy, to make the more lasting impression on the people and the more hopeful conversion of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Did give. This is an inadequate rendering. Revised Version reads, did give for offerings; others read, \"gave as an heave offering.\" In the light of our 2 Chronicles 35:7-9, the Revised Version rendering seems sufficient.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The strangers. Some consider this describes \"proselytes from Israel, who were non-Israelites.\" But this seems a most gratuitous supposition. The Hebrew גֵרִים does, in fact, purport only \"sojourners,\" and is frequently so translated, and our next clause corroborates this view. The interesting aspect of it is, that probably the persons described had emigrated from their own tribes, as they longed for Jerusalem, \"their chief joy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Since the time of Solomon. The reference is to Solomon's \"Feast of Tabernacles\" (2 Chronicles 7:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles30:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The priests the Levites; i.e. the priest-Levites, and not other Levites (Deuteronomy 17:18; Joshua 3:3). The Septuagint, therefore, is wrong in inserting \"and.\" A parallel expression in the New Testament is \"Men brethren\" (Acts 1:16; Acts 2:29, etc.). The priests were those authorized to bless (Numbers 6:23-26; 1 Chronicles 23:13).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - As much as the last verse of the foregoing chapter was all of the religious fervour of the occasion, this verse is all of the, practical honest work of the people and their leaders. All Israel that were present; i.e. present (or Hebrew, \"found\") in Jerusalem at the conclusion of the Feast of the Passover. Jerusalem had already been attended to (ver. 14 of foregoing chapter). Now the right mind of the people bore the reformation with a wave of enthusiasm over all Judah and Benjamin; and their righteous zeal carried them also over the strict limits of their own kingdom into Ephraim... and Manasseh - a course the more practicable, and even the more technically correct, because of the crippled state of the northern kingdom, and the probably still continued captivity of King Hoshea of Israel (2 Kings 17:1-4; 2 Kings 18:1-7; compare also the matter of our 2 Chronicles 29:24). Images... groves... high places... altars (comp. 2 Chronicles 14:3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Hezekiah appointed the courses. The twenty-fourth and following two chapters of 1 Chronicles give in full the appointment and arrangement of these courses, now again thrown out of order. Appointed; Hebrew, וַיַּעֲמֵר. It is equivalent to saying Hezekiah re-established the courses. Of the tents. The word is not \"tents,\" but the expressive and emphatic \"camps\" (מַחֲגות). Order of the divinest kind, discipline of the most perfect sort, are the glory of the temple and temple service of old, of the Church, her ministers, her members, and all her pious work of more modern date.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Also the king's portion of his substance; i.e. Hezekiah did not evade his own responsibilities in the matter of contribution. His \"port, on\" was the tithe, and he was evidently liable on \"substance very much\" (2 Chronicles 32:29). Numbers 28, 29, and Leviticus 23. give us the particulars of the offerings and set feasts, respectively here alluded to, in their original prescription.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He commanded... to give the portion of the priests... that they might be encouraged. Hezekiah's object was to send impulses of energy through the whole nation. The portions here spoken of are described originally in Exodus 23:19; Numbers 18:11-27; Deuteronomy 14:22, 23. After our word \"encouraged,\" we may probably supply the words \"to teach;\" for see our ch. 2 Chronicles 17:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Honey; Hebrew, דְּבַשׁ. This is no doubt the proper word for the honey of bees, for see Judges 14:8-18; 1 Samuel 14:27; Psalm 19:11, and many other passages. It is not certain, however, that the word did not cover other sweet preparations, as probably in Genesis 43:11; Ezekiel 27:17. The alternative reading, \"dates,\" has thus come into the margin, but on very insufficient title, as, while there is doubt as to whether the honey of bees was generally tithed, there is none at all that the people's pious zeal might prompt them to bring tithe of it voluntarily, among other things, that they at any time held in honour and had in abundance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - That dwelt in the cities of Judah. As vers. 4 and 5 referred to the dwellers in Jerusalem, so this verse tells of the dwellers in other cities, villages, etc., of the surrounding country (so 2 Chronicles 30:25). Their tithes of holy things probably denote the \"heave offerings\" of Aaron (Numbers 18:8; for other references to the matter of this verse, see Leviticus 27:30; Deuteronomy 14:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The third month... the heaps... the seventh month. The grain harvest closed with the Feast of Weeks, about the sixth day of the third month so that tithe in kind would be paid. The seventh month brought the Feast of Ingathering, when the vintage was over. For illustration of the despatch with which Hezekiah proceeded in his reforming works, comp. our 2 Chronicles 29:3; 2 Chronicles 30:2, 13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The questioning had no doubt to do with the subject how the superabundant contributions should be utilized or preserved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Azariah... chief priest of the house of Zadok. Though this Azariah be of the house of Zadok, he is not of the line of Jozadak; and we cannot be certain that he is one with him of 2 Chronicles 26:17, 20; in which case his grandson Jotham (2 Chronicles 27:1) would be grandfather of Hezekiah, inferring a long term both for his office and his life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To prepare chambers; i.e. to prepare for present use the chambers constructed for the purpose (1 Kings 6:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Faithfully.

Shemaiah (see 2 Chronicles 29:12, 14). In the cities (see Joshua 21:19). In their set office; i.e. in their appointed duty. The word (בֶּךאמוּנָה) here used bespeaks the important and trustworthy nature of the duty committed to those spoken of, and probably betrays the fact that the duty had not always in the past been honestly discharged (see same word in ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Beside their genealogy of males; i.e. except (מִלְבַד) the family count of males, etc., the remainder of the verse describing those who are meant by the excepted. They were excepted because for themselves and their little ones, their daily present temple service brought their daily maintenance as of course. The \"unto every one\" of our version is misleading. Keil translates perspicuously, \"of all those who entered the house of the Lord, to the daily portion for their service,\" etc. The glimpse of the picture of the little children fed for the sake of their fathers' sanctuary service, so true to the true religion even of nature, is a pleasant glimpse to catch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - It is hard to feel certain as to the exact construction of this and the following verse. Keil would translate here,\" And concerning the catalogue of the priests, it was according, etc.; and the Levites, they were from twenty years,\" etc. And arrived at ver. 18, and unable to proceed in like manner with it, he reverts to the \"to give\" of ver. 15, as what is to stand before the words,\" to the genealogy [or, 'catalogue'] of all their little ones.\" He thus treats both vers. 16 and 17 as parenthetical. It seems quite as probable that the \"to give\" should be shown before ver. 17 as well as ver. 18. On the whole, this seems to suit best the entire passage. The significant וְאֵת, at the beginning of ver. 17, neutralizes then the מִלְבַד of ver. 16, and connects vers. 15 and 17. (On the words, from twenty years old, comp. 1 Chronicles 23:27. See also Numbers 4:3; Numbers 8:24.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - (Comp. our 2 Chronicles 20:13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The much more manifest meaning of this verse confirms the interpretation favoured just above for vers. 15, 17, 18. The men that were expressed by name; translate, men were expressed... to give. The purport of this verse is to say that all priests and Levites of full age were sacredly remembered and similarly carefully provided for, viz. those also who lived in the fields of the suburbs of the cities (Leviticus 25:32-34; Numbers 35:2-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This verse, when rendered with literal exactness, is a fine instance of the force and brevity of the Hebrew style in Old Testament history; And thus did Hezekiah in all Judah, and he did the good and the right and the truth in the sight of Jehovah his God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles31:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - In every work; translate, and in all work. The \"all work\" being in the following clause triply described as pertaining to the service of the house of God, the observance of the sacred Law, and of any individual commandments flowing from it.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The establishment thereof; translate, and this (his) truth. The word is the same with the third of the trio (see above), as given in ver. 20 of the foregoing chapter. The evident meaning intended to be conveyed is, \"After these things and this truth,\" i.e. truthfulness of conduct on the part of Hezekiah, the strict rendering being, \"After the things and the truth this.\" Sennacherib... came ... entered into Judah... encamped against the fenced cities... thought to win. This verse and these items of it may without any inconvenient strain be made conterminous with just one verse in Kings, the thirteenth of 2 Kings 18. The king personally seems to have devoted himself especially to the siege of Lachish, an Amoritish city indeed originally, and a place of great strength of petition, but conquered by Judah (Joshua 10:26, 31-35; 2 Chronicles 11:9; 2 Chronicles 25:27; and infra here and in parallel). This invasion of Sennacherib (Herod., 2:141), son of Sargon, may be with moderate certainty affixed to the date B.C. 701. Thought to win. A weak rendering for the preferable purposed or boasted to break them (Genesis 7:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When Hezekiah saw... and that he purposed... Jerusalem. Whether the three verses of ill omen already alluded to (2 Kings 18:14-16) may be road precedent to this verse, and purport that the bribes had been paid, and yet had failed of their object, so that Hezekiah was now compelled to brace himself to the occasion, and \"took counsel,\" etc. (next verse); or whether this verse dates (as some think)the quailing heart of Hezekiah, and an offer or part payment of treasure by Hezekiah to Sennacherib, which only increased his insolence, as immediately now related, is uncertain, perhaps. In the face of the emphatic language of the three verses of the parallel, and in consideration of the possible motives as suggested above for our compiler omitting the matter altogether, we incline to the former opinion. That would have the effect of making this verse say that when Hezekiah had his eyes opened to the failure of his bribe - a waste payment, for that Sennacherib still \"purposed to fight against Jerusalem\" - he finally proceeded to take the right steps. However, the witness and indications of Isaiah 22:13-19; Isaiah 29:2-4, may go some way to shield Hezekiah from the entire blame. The silence of our compiler on the whole matter is the one residuum of fact, and unfortunate in its suggestion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To stop the waters of the fountains... without the city. These fountains or springs were probably those represented by En Rogel, on the Ophel spur or very large mound, or fortified hill (mistranslated possibly from that circumstance \"tower,\" in 2 Kings 5:24; Isaiah 32:14), on the southeast of the temple. The object of Hezekiah is obvious enough. The word (סָתַּם) for \"stopping\" occurs in all thirteen times - twice in piel in Genesis, once in niph. in Nehemiah, and ten times in kal in Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms. It is for all material purposes very uniformly rendered in all these places by the word \"stop\" eight times, and otherwise \"shut\" or \"closed,\" or to carry a derived meaning, \"hidden\" or \"secret.\" If the word \"shut\" or \"shut off\" were employed, it would fit every occasion. So we are not told here how he stopped the fountain or fountains, but that he shut the waters off from one direction and guided them into another, vie. by a conduit running westward from the springs and the Gihon (i.e. the brook) flowing naturally down the Tyropoean valley to a pool prepared for it in the city (see our ver. 30; and 2 Kings 18:17; 2 Kings 20:20; Ecclus, 48:17; and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 339). This pool was very probably none other than the pool of Siloam.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The brook that ran through the midst of the land. Compare the Septuagint, which has it, \"through the midst of the city;\" and compare foregoing verse and note; and see again above reference to Courier's 'Handbook' at length.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He strengthened himself; i.e., as in our several previous instances of the occurrence of the phrase (1 Chronicles 11:10; 2 Chronicles 12:1; 2 Chronicles 25:11; 2 Chronicles 26:8), he took all possible means to make himself and people and city strong to withstand the invader. All the wall that was broken (see Isaiah 22:9). Although we read that the devastation wrought by Joash (2 Chronicles 25:23) was very largely repaired by Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:9) and by Jotham (2 Chronicles 27:3), it is not explicitly said that the broken four hundred cubits of wall, from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, were made absolutely good again, although in the matter of towers and fortifications much was evidently done. Note also the word \"all\" here, side by side with the \"much\" of 2 Chronicles 27:3. And raised (it) up to the towers. Discard this Authorized Version rendering. The meaning cannot be certainly pronounced upon, but perhaps it may be intended to say that he heightened the towers. The objection is that the same verb is wanted for the next clause, and that its rendering would need to be there slightly reduced again to a mere statement of raising from the ground (i.e. building) another wall without. Repaired Millo (see note, 1 Chronicles 11:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The street of the gate; translate, the wide area at the gate, etc.; what gate is not specified, but presumably either \"the gate of Ephraim,\" which would be the one opposed to the camp of the besiegers, or possibly \"the comer gate\" (2 Chronicles 25:23; and Courier's 'Handbook,' pp. 343-345).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Several of the descriptive dramatic touches of Isaiah 22:4-14 are forcible and apt commentary to this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - (See 2 Kings 6:16; Jeremiah 17:5.) The admirable language of Hezekiah here quickens our desire to feel sure that this was after (and after genuine repentance for) his faithlessness (2 Kings 18:14-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The passage beginning with this verse and ending with ver. 21 represents the much fuller parallel (2 Kings 18:17-19:37), fifty-eight verses in all This much greater fulness is owing to the greater length at which the language of defiance on the part of Sennacherib and his appointed officers is narrated, and the matter of his subsequent letter; also the prayer of Hezekiah; and his application to Isaiah, with the reply of the latter to it. On the other side, there is very little additional in our narrative, a few words heightening the effect in our vers. 18, 20, 21, constituting the whole of such additional matter. The vague mark of time, after this, with which our present verse opens, merely says that in due course of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, and attack of the fenced cities (ver. 1), he proceeds to send his servants and his insolent defiances to the metropolis, Jerusalem itself. The three words in italics, \"himself laid \"siege,\" should evidently give place to the single word \"remained\" or \"was;\" i.e. he and all his host with him remained at, or opposite to, Lachish, while his servants went to defy Jerusalem in his name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In the siege. This Authorized Version rendering is manifestly incorrect, though, if we simply omit the article, and tender in siege, we shall probably have Sennacherib's exact idea. He spoke not of the literal technical thing siege, but of the distress and confinement that the apprehension of the siege did not fail to bring. This so to say moral tone to the rendering of the word (בְּמָצור) is much to be preferred to that of the margin, \"in the fortress or stronghold.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The policy of Sennacherib, in the direct attempt to undermine Hezekiah by appealing straight to his people, instead of to himself or his ministers of state, is yet more pronounced in expression, as seen in 2 Kings 18:26, 27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This misrepresenting of Hezekiah's pious actions is thought by some to have been innocent ignorance on the part of Sennacherib. Yet it is scarcely credible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Some of these deeds of Sennacherib and his fathers, i.e. predecessors in the kingdom of Assyria, are mentioned in detail in 2 Kings 17, passim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The urgency of Sennacherib's appeal to the people was of course his way of trying to save work of actual siege, fighting, etc., to himself and his army. The how much less of the message of Sennacherib probably meant that his estimate of the your God i.e. the God of Israel, was measured partly by the comparative smallness and unwarlike character of the nation of Judah, when set side by side with the great heathen nations, and partly by the spiritual and invisible character and being of God, little intelligible to such a one as Sennacherib.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And his servants spoke yet more. A glimpse of the fact that the compiler of our book very designedly excerpted only what he thought needful from very much more abundant resources.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel (so 2 Kings 19:8-14). The rumour of the approach of \"Tirhakah King of Ethiopia\" (ver. 9) quickened Sennacherib's anxiety to make short work with the conflict at Jerusalem, by intimidating the people to an early collapse of their resistance,.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - In the Jews' speech (see again 2 Kings 18:26, 27). The last three clauses of this verse are additional matter to that contained in the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - As against the gods of the people of the earth, the work of the hands of men. Our compiler, at all events, signalizes the difference, which Sennacherib worse than minimizes, between the God of Israel and the so-called gods of the surrounding heathen nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For the prayer of Hezekiah, see 2 Kings 19:14-19; and for the place of the prayer or prayers of Isaiah, and the indications of their having been offered, see alike 2 Chronicles 19:4-7, and the verses of the grand passage, 20-3 t.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The exact matter corresponding with this one verse is embraced by vers. 35-37 in the parallel (2 Kings 19.). It gives the number of slain as a hundred and eighty-five thousand. It does not speak of the heavy proportion of leaders and captains lost. It leads us to suppose that for all survivers it was a surprise in the morning - that silent vision of the dead in such vast array. Stating, on the other hand, in mere historic dry detail, the return of Sennacherib to his own land, his dwelling at Nineveh, and assassination, in the house of Nisroch \"his god,\" at the hands of his own two sons, mentioned by name Adrammelech and Sharezer, who had to fly for it to Armenia (Ararat), it does not show the obviously designed moral touch of our compiler, so he returned with shame of face to his own land, nor the similarly complexioned description of the time, place, and agents of his assassination. Lastly, it gives Esarhaddon as the name of his successor on the throne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - This verse, with the notification of Hezekiah's great deliverance from the hand of the King of Assyria, summarizes also his various other deliverances, with tacit reference to such suggestion of other conflicts as we have in 2 Kings 18:7, 8. Guided them on every side. The Septuagint reads, gave them rest. This suits the connection as regards meaning best, and also as regards the immediately following adverb, \"on every side.\" It has also in our present book the correspondences of ch. 14:6; 15:15; and especially 2 Chronicles 20:30, with the Hebrew words of which, an easily supposed rectification brings it into exact agreement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Presents to Hezekiah. The \"precious things\" (מִגְדָּנות) of 2 Chronicles 21:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The extreme brevity again of our compiler, in the account of Hezekiah's illness, and his passing so lightly over whatever in it cast shades upon his character and career, cannot escape our notice. Much fuller is the narrative of 2 Kings 20:1-21. Gave him a sign (see 2 Kings 20:8-11, and our ver. 31, middle clause. See also at length of the sickness of Hezekiah, Isaiah 38.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The parallel, 2 Kings 20:12-19 and Isaiah 39, fully explain the circumstances here referred to, and we may conclude that Hezekiah's sin consisted in the spirit in which he acted, displaying his treasures, so that it was in the fullest sense a sin of\" the heart.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Hezekiah humbled himself. Possibly the language of the nineteenth verse in the parallel is the one surviving historic trace of this. The language found in Jeremiah 26:19 may be also a note of the same, though its dependence (see vers. 17, 18) on Micah 3:12 seems to make it less likely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - If Hezekiah not only began to negotiate, but actually paid the precious metals, etc., with which he offered to buy off the invasion of Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:14-16), he may have become considerably recouped by the presents and gifts subsequently, liberally it would appear, brought to him (see our ver. 23), and it is possible that this may give us some further clue to where it was that his heart strayed, while displaying his wealth and treasures to the messengers of Berodach-Baladan King of Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStorehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Cotes for flocks should be tendered, conversely, flocks to the stalls, i.e. stalls full of flocks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Stopped the upper watercourse, etc. (see our vers. 3, 4). What Hezekiah \"stopped\" was the spring, or more strictly access to it, and guided its prized waters down, probably by an underground channel, to Siloam, or else to the pool in the city which he had constructed and enclosed by that \"another wall without\" (ver. 5), west of the \"city of David.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Howbeit; literally, and thus. The italic type dispensed with, the verse may be rendered, And thus with or among the ambassadors of the princes... God left him to, etc. The princes. This plural may be the pluralis excellentiae, and designate the king himself, who doubtless issued the official command to the messengers to visit Hezekiah with gifts, etc., but not necessarily so. The word may betray the inquiries and curiosity of the princes of Babylon, under the king, the expression of which led to the embassy, so to call it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - In the vision of Isaiah (so Isaiah 1:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles32:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death.

The parallel gives prominence to the one Asherah, ten times offensive, as set up in the house of the Lord (ver. 7 there). The mention of his pantheon of the host of heaven is an addition to the wickedness of former wicked kings. It is also noted in the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In Jerusalem (so 2 Chronicles 6:6; 2 Chronicles 7:16).

Parallel (2 Kings 21:6), \"his son,\" in the singular number (see also 2 Kings 16:3 compared with our 2 Chronicles 28:3). There can be no doubt that this worst of cruel abominations, learned from Ammon and Moab, amounted to nothing less than the sacrifice of the child in the fire. It is, perhaps, something remarkable that we do not encounter anywhere any description of the exact manner of administration of this cruelty, and of its taking effect on the pitiable victim. The solemn commands of Leviticus 18:21 and Deuteronomy 18:10 bespeak sufficiently distinctly the prevision and earnest precaution of the Divine Ruler of Israel, through Moses, on behalf of his people. The following references all bear on the subject, and will be studied with advantage in order given: 2 Kings 3:27; 2 Kings 17:17; Ezekiel 20:26; Micah 6:7; Amos 5:26; Jeremiah 7:32; Jeremiah 19:4; Ezekiel 16:20; Ezekiel 20:26. In the valley of the son of Hinnom (Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:16). On an elevation at the eastern extremity of this valley it was that Solomon erected \"high places\" to Moloch, entailing on himself a long and dire responsibility (1 Kings 11:7). Consult also our 2 Chronicles 28:3 and note there; with added reference, Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 172, 482. Also he observed times; Revised Version, and he practised augury.

This root is found once in piel infinitive (Genesis 9:14), and is rendered (Authorized Version), \"when I bring a cloud,\" etc.; beside, it is found in all ten times, always in poel, in preterite twice (the present passage and parallel), future once (Leviticus 19:26), participle seven times (Deuteronomy 18:10, 14; Judges 9:37, margin), in which six places it is rendered (Authorized Version) \"observing times,\" once in Isaiah and Micah with rendering \"soothsayers,\" again in Isaiah \"sorcerers,\" and in Jeremiah \"enchanter.\" There is difficulty in fixing its exact meaning, though its general meaning may be embraced in the words of the Revised Version. A likely meaning, judging from derivation, may be the practising augury from observing of the clouds. The passages in Leviticus and Deuteronomy are those that of old solemnly prohibited it. And used enchantments; Hebrew, וְנִחֵשׁ; the root is the familiar word for \"serpent.\" The verb occurs eleven times, always in piel. The prohibition to practise such \"enchantment\" or divination is found in Leviticus 19:26 and Leviticus 18:10; the five occasions of the use of the word in Genesis, however (Genesis 30:27; Genesis 44:5, 15), argue that it was not a thing intrinsically bad, but bad probably from . certain, so to say, simoniacal possibilities to which it lent itself. There lay in it some assumption, no doubt, of superhuman help, and the wickedness may have consisted in assuming it where it was not real. And used witchcraft; Hebrew, וְכִשֵּׂפ; Revised Version, and practised sorcery. The word is found six times in piel. The prohibition is found in Deuteronomy 18:10; the rendering of the word (Authorized Version) is by the term \"sorcery\" three times, and \"witch\" or \"witchcraft\" the other three times. Dealt with a familiar Spirit, and with wizards. The prohibitions are in Leviticus 19:31; Leviticus 20:6, 27; Deuteronomy 18:11. See as illustrations 1 Samuel 28:3-21; and notice the language of Isaiah 8:19, \"that chirp and mutter;\" and Isaiah 19:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - (Comp.

That parallel, however, supplies in its ver. 16 a very forcible narration of the evil conduct of Manasseh in Jerusalem itself, so that he \"filled\" it with \"innocent blood\" from \"one end to another.\" The King of Assyria; i.e. either Esarhaddon, B.C. 680, or (though it is not probable) his son, Assur-banipal, B.C. 667-647. Among the thorns; i.e. with hooks or rings (so 2 Kings 19:28, where the same word is used; as also in Exodus 35:22; Isaiah 37:29; Ezekiel 19:4, 9; Ezekiel 29:4; Ezekiel 38:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And prayed unto him. The apocryphal \"Prayer of Manasses\" is not at all likely to be authentic. And brought him again to Jerusalem. The Targum gives many mythical tales as to how this deliverance was effected. Then Manasseh knew that. Did he not know, well know, before? So far as the mode of expression may in any degree warrant such a stretch of charity, what an idea it gives of the force with which grossest error will captivate even the taught; and with what force of a furious wind did the contaminating influence of idolatries all around sweep betimes before them - these very kings and chief men of Judah and Jerusalem! It is evident that there was always among the people a \"remnant\" who kept the faith. See here, e.g., the reference to the \"innocent blood\" shed in Jerusalem, no doubt bleed of those who would not consent to idolatry - blood of noble martyrs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The wall without; or, Revised Version, the outer wall, is probably one with that of Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 32:5), which now Manasseh repairs, or rebuilds, and perhaps lengthens as well as heightens. The fish gate (Nehemiah 13:16), left on the north of Jerusalem, and opened on the main road for the sea (Conder's 'Handbook,' etc., p. 343). The wall traversed the north and east sides to Ophel, \"on the wall\" of which, it is said (2 Chronicles 27:3), \"Jotham built much.\" Hezekiah also built much there, and now Manasseh raised it up a very great height.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - It will be noted how the mount of the house of the Lord is here differenced from the city. \"The city\" seems to have comprised the two hills east and west of the Tyropoean valley, and the \"fore\" city enclosed by the new wall (see Dr. Murphy's valuable little 'Handbook to Chronicles'). The strange gods, the idol, and the altars have all been mentioned in vers. 3-7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Compare Hezekiah's good work (2 Chronicles 31:1) with his son's bad work (2 Chronicles 33:3); the latter could undo his father's good, but now could not undo his own evil! The illegitimate worshippings and offerings of high places, though they had been \"winked at\" from time to time by some of even the better of the kings, were of course essentially counter to the one national worship in the one temple, and to the offerings and sacrifices of the one national altar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The parallel again obtains (2 Kings 21:17, 18), but in shorter form. His prayer. This is for the present, at any rate, lost, the apocryphal and the Septuagint manuscript version of it alike not genuine. The words of the seers. So again our compiler shows undesigned correspondence with the writer of the parallel, as above quoted (2 Kings 21:10-15). As to the original authorities quoted here, book of the kings, etc., and next verse, \"the sayings of the seers,\" see Introduction, vol. 1. § 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In his own house. The parallel has, \"In the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza;\" i.e., with little doubt, what had been formerly the garden of one Uzza.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The long reign of Manasseh of fifty-five years - a signal and merciful instance of space given for repentance - ended, his death met him presumably at the age of sixty-seven. The son who succeeded him was twenty-two years old, born therefore not before his father was forty-five years old. This may be an indication that it was indeed not one son only whom Manasseh \"caused to pass through the fire\" (ver. 6). He emulated the sins of the former life of his father, but did not, like him, repent. It will be noted that in ver. 19 of the parallel his mother's name is given as \"Meshulle-meth, the daughter of Haruz, of Jotbah,\" of whom nothing is known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - His servants conspired. So also Joash and Amaziah had been punished, the latter avenging the death of his father on those servants who had caused it (2 Kings 1:14:5; 2 Chronicles 24:25, 26; 2 Chronicles 25:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles33:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The people of the land. The emphatic expression here used (as also in the parallel), with its repetition in same verse malting it more so, may either betray the unfortunate sympathy that the worse element of the nation felt with the bad king and his evil ways, or it may mean that the healthier element of the people insisted on the right respect being observed to the proper succession. The conduct of Josiah from very tender years, which could not have been entirely his own, but must be credited in part to those who taught and influenced him, throws the balance of probability, perhaps, into this latter and more charitable view. The parallel contains two closing verses (25, 26) additional to what we have, giving the authority as the \"book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah,\" and stating that Amen also \"was buried in his sepulchre, in the garden of Uzza.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJosiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Again the name of the mother is omitted. From the parallel we learn she was \"Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This, with the following four verses, forms the commentary on the statement of ver. 2, that Josiah \"declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.\" We cannot mistake the allusion in this verse to his personal religion at, say, sixteen years of age, as the foundation of his religious reign and of the practical devotion to reformation, instanced as commencing with his twentieth year. It may be here noted that the Prophet Jeremiah was called to his work in the year following thereupon, or, perhaps, the very same year (Jeremiah 1:1, 2). It is highly likely that Josiah and Jeremiah were given to one another providentially, to cooperate in all good works, now so needed for Church and state. The three dates of the eighth, twelfth, and (ver. 8) the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign wore dates memorable in his life. For the two kinds of images of this verse, see succeeding note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Note references in Leviticus 26:1, 30. The images, that were on high above them; i.e., as Revised Version, the sun-images (הַחַמָּנִים). The word and name occur only eight times - in Leviticus as just quoted; in our Second Book of Chronicles three times; in Isaiah twice; and in Ezekiel twice. The groves; i.e. the Asherim; again as last verse. The carved images; Revised Version, graven images; Hebrew, הַפְסִלִים. This word is found twenty-two times, occurring in Deuteronomy, Judges, Kings, Chronicles, Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, and Micah. The molten images; Hebrew, הַמַּסֵּכות. This word also occurs just twenty-two times, from Exodus downwards. Made dust of them and strewed it (so Exodus 32:20; 2 Kings 23:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Note herein the striking fulfilment of 1 Kings 13:1-3, of which our parallel (2 Kings 23:12-14, 16-20) gives a more detailed account, especially as regards Israel, though not failing to recognize Judah and Jerusalem's share in the need of purgation and punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In the cities of Manasseh,... Ephraim,... Simeon, even unto Naphtali. Manasseh and Ephraim lay very nearly in the centre of the whole land, while Simeon and Naphtali were respectively at the southern and northern extremities. With their mattocks. This rendering may be correct, and cannot be said to be foreign to the sense and connection of the passage, the Hebrew word in that ease being the feminine plural of חֶרֶב Perhaps, however, the word is one with that found in Psalm 109:10, and may be rendered \"in their ruined,\" i.e. semi-ruined, \"condition.\" Note Keri also, which favours the latter reading; the Septuagint shows simply words which may best translate, and in their neighbourhoods respectively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - When.

The original, however, does not warrant the laying of any stress on the when, found again in the Authorized Version. Shaphau. In the parallel (2 Kings 22:3) Shaphan is designated \"the scribe.\" His descendants, to the second generation, at all events, did him honor (Jeremiah 26:24; Jeremiah 29:3; Jeremiah 36:10, 12, 25; Ezekiel 8:11; see also 2 Kings 25:22). The names of Masseiah (Jeremiah 35:4) and Joah (2 Kings 18:18) are known, but not marking the present persons.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hilkiah the high priest. Of Hilkiah's ancestors and descendants we learn something in the following references: 1 Chronicles 6:13, 14; 1 Chronicles 9:11; 2 Kings 25:18; Nehemiah 11:11; Ezra 7:1. They delivered. This means that Hilkiah's people delivered of what they had collected to Shaphan and his colleagues, who again in their turn (ver. 10) \"put it into the hand of the workmen,' etc. This is certainly the meaning of 2 Kings 22:4-9. And they returned to Jerusalem; translate, and of the dwellers in Jerusalem. Note Keri, and see 2 Chronicles 35:18; and Septuagint rendering here and there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And they put it; i.e. Shaphan and colleagues, according to the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The exact work done we are unable to follow with precision. The parallel describes it, in more general terms, as \"repairing the breaches.\" The repairs here spoken of, however, betoken, to say the least the rough usage, as well as \"negligence,\" of kings like Manasseh and Amen, and suggest a further question as to the nature of those heathen and idolatrous practices, which cost so much to the very structure of temple and houses, i.e. probably the contiguous chambers of the main building (1 Kings 6:5), the exact style of which, however, is very doubtful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Faithfully, Refer back to note, 2 Chronicles 31:12. To set... forward; Hebrew, לְנַצֶּהַ; the idea, of course, not so much that of expediting, as of guiding and instructing. The mention of those Levites whoso business was music is rather a surprise, and is not found in the parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Scribes. Considering the mention of \"scribes\" in the plural in 1 Kings 4:3, although it stands alone, till, at all events, the time of Hezekiah (as testified by Proverbs 25:1), it is at any rate not improbable that an order of scribes was instituted by Solomon; that it fell into desuetude immediately under the divided kingdom, and, coming into vogue again under Hezekiah, is now mentioned in the natural way we here find it. The mention of the \"scribe\" in the singular number is of frequent occurrence in the historic books, and in Isaiah (Isaiah 33:18; Isaiah 36:22). The officers. This word reproduces, in the Hebrew, the familiar shoterim of Exodus 5:10 (see also 1 Chronicles 23:3-6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The time of this verse is not free from ambiguity, which the parallel does not remove. It purports either that, on occasion of \"bringing out the money,\" Hilkiah providentially lighted on his find, or that he availed himself of that occasion to report and give up the find made some time or other previously. The italic-type word \"given,\" in this verse, it is better to discard, and to restore the omitted words, \"by the hand of;\" i.e. the book was either Moses' original handwriting and solemn deposit (Deuteronomy 31:26) - in that ease nearly eight centuries and a half old-or, at any rate, the standard copy and authorized successor of it, though we nowhere read of such a copy having been made, nor is it necessary to doubt the durability of the original. A book should be rendered the book.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The implication on the face of this verse as of the parallel (2 Kings 22:10), is that Shaphan leaves the king to surmise (which he very quickly does), from hearing a portion (Hebrew here, read in it; in parallel, \"read it\") of the book, what it was.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - With one insignificant exception (the omission here of the word סֶפֶר), the words of this verse are identical with the parallel in its ver. 11. The same, to all purposes, may be said of our twelve succeeding verses, compared with the parallel in its ver. 12 - 2 Chronicles 23:3. The king rent his clothes, in grief that the practice of his nation had diverged so terribly from their ever-to-be-venerated Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Ahikam the son of Shaphan (see Jeremiah 26:24; Jeremiah 40:5). Abdon the son of Micah. The parallel (2 Kings 22:12) and the Syriac Version have \"Achbor the son of Michaiah\" (see also Jeremiah 26:22; Jeremiah 36:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah. The parallel shows, \"For me, and for the people, and for all Judah\" (2 Kings 22:13), without any apparent specific reference to Israel. Our present passage may intend to glance at the fact that the bettor part of Israel were in captivity; and it will be possible, at any rate, to read the last clause as intending, not \"for them that are left in Judah,\" but \"and for them in Judah.\" That is poured out; Hebrew, גִחְכָה. The parallel shows, \"that is kindled;\" Hebrew, נִצְחָה. The considerable resemblance between the Hebrew words is worthy of passing note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The question may suggest itself, Why was not Jeremiah (2 Chronicles 35:25; 2 Chronicles 36:21) at once consulted? Probably he was at Anathoth, and not immediately accessible. Tikvath. In Hebrew, Tokhath; and in parallel, Tikvah. Hasrah. In parallel, Harhas. In the college; Revised Version, following Hebrew, in the (Mishneh) second quarter (see Zephaniah 1:10; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 342). Nothing is known of Huldah, nor of Shallum her husband, except what lies in this and the parallel place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The oracular answer of Huldah, contained in this and the following five verses, is very closely paralleled by the six verses of 2 Kings 22:15-20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Poured out. So here again, as above (ver. 21). Yet our Septuagint has \"kindled;\" and also the parallel in the Hebrew. The word \"quenched,\" which immediately follows, suits the word \"kindled,\" and what with the testimony of the Septuagint, both here and in ver. 21, and the Hebrew in both passages of the parallel, suggests that \"poured\" is the substitution, by some mishap, of a copyist - a mishap, for instance, that might result from the copyist writing from the speech of some one, and not from his own inspection. Exactly similar mistakes may often be seen in our maps, where the spelling and misspelling of the name of some place seem only to be accounted for by the same supposition. The catastrophe now foretold befell the nation manifestly in the reigns of the succeeding sovereigns, whose days were emphatically both few and evil, viz. the two sons of Josiah, Jehoahaz and Eliakim, whose name was changed to Jehoiakim; and the two sons of this latter, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah (according to 2 Kings 24:17, the same with Mattaniah, and son of Josiah).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The wise, religious, and unselfish conduct of the king is clearly betokened in the course he took, as narrated here and in the succeeding three verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The Levites. The parallel mentions \"prophets\" and omits \"Levites,\" which latter our compiler is safe not to forget. When it is said in this verse, he read, the meaning, of course, is \"the priests\" read (Deuteronomy 31:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The king stood in his place; i.e. not simply]in his order, but upon his royal pedestal, or platform; possibly following a mere suggestion, originating with the word used in the parallel, \"by his pillar\" (so Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Some think the text here corrupt, both for the presence of the words, and in Benjamin, and the absence of the words, \"in the covenant.\" Their case, however, is scarcely conclusive (see 2 Kings 23:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles34:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The parallel (2 Kings 23:4-20) gives some succinct account of Josiah's removal of abominations, here glanced at so briefly.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.35":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - They killed the Passover on the fourteenth... of the first month; i.e. on the day appointed originally (Exodus 12:6). It will be remembered that, under special circumstances, the same day of the second month was authorized by \"Hezekiah and his princes\" (2 Chronicles 30:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Comp. 2 Chronicles 7:6; 2 Chronicles 31:2; 1 Chronicles 23:32; and our notes in those places.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - That taught (see 2 Chronicles 17:7, 9: Deuteronomy 33:8-10). Which were holy (so 2 Chronicles 23:6). Put the holy ark... net to you a burden on the shoulder. There is a double difficulty, though not of a very formidable character, in this portion of the verse. We can only conjecture why the ark was not in its proper place, probably having been temporarily removed during Josiah's own restorations, or possibly having never been yet replaced from the date of some earlier removal of an iniquitous character and on the part of an iniquitous king. Secondly, as to the burden, some would explain the language as a reminiscence of the general and ever-applicable principle found in 1 Chronicles 23:26. This, at any rate, would seem rather more satisfactory than the suggestion conveyed by the italic type of our Authorized Version. Perhaps the explanation may rather be that the ark had latterly again and again been shifted, and Josiah wishes to protest that neither for one reason nor another shall it be again moved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - According to the writing of David... and... of Solomon (comp. our 2 Chronicles 8:14 and 1 Chronicles 9:10-34, and the other marginal references, 1 Chronicles 23. - 26.). It is more than possible that the fullest tabulation of arrangements of this kind has not come down to us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In brief, this verse purports to say that, for this special occasion of the Passover, the Levites shall take special care that, as stationed in the holy precincts, there shall be a family of themselves ready to minister to a family... of the people, each to each.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Prepare your brethren; i.e. as betokened by the wording of the foregoing verse, their brethren, the people. The Levites were to purify themselves, perform their other duties of killing the victims, and withal to use their opportunities of instructing the people to the better order and performance of the whole solemn service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Lambs... kids... bullocks. The variety of sacrificial offerings is specifically noticed in our ver. 13. While kids (\"Ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats,\" Exodus 12:5) as well as lambs answered for the Paschal feast, the bullocks served for \"burnt\" and \"peace offerings\" (Numbers 28:16-25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The princes; i.e. the three immediately mentioned by name. Jehiel (see Ezra 8:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Conaninh ...

And so did they with the oxen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Removed; i.e. cut off; the verso purporting that those who officiated cut off those portions of the animals slain which were of the nature of burnt offering, that they might be taken by the offering worshippers to the priests at the altars, there to be entirely consumed. Of the people; probably better, literally, to the children of the people, i.e. \"to the people\" (Leviticus 3:3-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Roasted. (For the emphatic and repeated command to roast, see Exodus 12:8, 9; Deuteronomy 16:7.) Sod. The sodden or boiled offerings, peace offerings, were ordinarily eaten on the days of unleavened bread, and then particularly on the first and seventh (Leviticus 23:4-8, etc.). Divided them speedily among all the people. The marginal rendering of the original, and the Revised Version rendering, carried them quickly, may be noted; nevertheless attention is invited, probably not so much to the speed or quickness in question, but to the fact that \"all the people\" were carefully attended to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - To the marginal references of 1 Chronicles 25; 1 Chronicles 9; 1 Chronicles 26; add 2 Chronicles 6:33-47NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The same day; literally, that day, as next verse, \"at that time.\" No stress belongs to the day as the same day evidently.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Upon this verse Professor Murphy says, \"The Passover in Hezekiah's time was great (2 Chronicles 30:26), but this was greater. For it was kept on the proper day in the first month, and was not a mere supplementary Passover; it was observed with due regularity, and not by worshippers some of whom were unclean; and if we allow thirteen persons for each lamb or kid, there were upwards of half a million communicants; while, so far as we know, there were only seventeen thousand sheep presented by Hezekiah and his princes (2 Chronicles 30:24), which would not supply more than half the number of partakers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The date is stamped as ever-memorable, ever-honorable landmark in Josiah's reign.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - After all this. A period of about thirteen years of happy retrospect is now the portion of the good king. This period brings itself to an unhappy and even fatal termination in the year B.C. 608; when, as it would appear by the result, King Josiah did wrong, and went out of his way, in opposing the march of Pharaoh-Necho (who reigned B.C. 611-595), successor of Psammetichus King of Egypt, against Cyaxares (the monarch who, with Nabo-polassar, had taken Nineveh, B.C. 625) King of Assyria (2 Kings 23:29), or King of Babylon at Circesium on the River Phrat, the head-quarters now of the united Assyrian and Babylonian power. Where the fault or sin of Josiah lay - whether he ran before he was sent, or whether, according to our following two verses, he set out against the Divine word by Necho - is certainly a question left in obscurity. Nothing is said in our history or its parallel to accredit the tale of Necho, or to discredit the heart and motive of Josiah - nothing except what silence and the result seem to say. One other clement of interest and of difficulty may be added to the question; for of the thirteen years' interval, which we have described above as one presumably of happy retrospect in certain aspects for Josiah, we know nothing from Scripture, but have every reason to suppose that during it Josiah and his kingdom had become subject, if only nominally, to Nabopolassar; so that, in offering to resist Necho of Egypt, he was offering to strengthen so far forth the royal line which did dishonour to his own country and his country's God. Upon this supposition, however, we can lay no stress.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Not against thee this day. Possibly the suggestion couched in these last two words may have been the opposite of agreeable to King Josiah. For God commanded me to make haste. The margin reading of the Revised Version seems preferable, both for the Hebrew text and the connection, hath given command to speed me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Would not turn his face (so 2 Chronicles 25:17 and its parallel, 2 Kings 14:8). Disguised himself. This is, possibly enough, the intention of the word, but it is more probable that the simple meaning is fully armed himself. The Septuagint has strengthened himself. Hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God. Unless these words are intended to convey really their patent and most natural import, it is tenfold strange that they should find a place in the compilation of the Chronicles. It is indeed possible that they might purport, from the pen of the writer of Chronicles, that in point of fact the words of Necho had been the permitted warning, though not the actually dictated language of God. The genius of the whole passage strongly reminds us of 2 Chronicles 25:17, 19-21; and its parallel in 2 Kings 14. In the valley of Megiddo; i.e. among those hills which separate the country of the coast from Esdraelon - a valley as that \"of Kishon\" (see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 356, 339, 347; but see also Conder's 'Handbook,' p. 287, where a different view is taken).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And he died. If the form of words used in the parallel, 2 Kings 23:30, be followed, Josiah was dead before they reached Jerusalem. And all... mourned for Josiah. We still find no note whatever of blame attributed to Josiah, and the general mourning (Zechariah 12:11) appears to have been most genuine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - If Jeremiah's lamenting on this occasion was one committed to writing, it has not survived. To this day; i.e. probably anniversary after anniversary to the time of the writer to whom this statement belongs, the authority from which our compiler draws his materials. Written in the lamentations. We have here another glimpse of a work which has not been handed down to us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Goodness; Hebrew text, kindnesses. According to that... written in the Law. This sentence pictures Josiah a careful, loving student of the Word, to the end that he might become a \"doer\" of it.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles35:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINE","2Chr.36":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The people of the land took Jehoahaz (see parallel, 2 Kings 23:30). The form of expression may indicate the hearty zeal of the nation for this chosen son of Josiah, who seems to have been not the eldest. In the next verse, as Revised Version, he is called Joahaz. In 1 Chronicles 3:15, as in the affecting passage Jeremiah 22:10-12, his name appears as Shallum. His mother's name was Hamutal, while the name of the mother of his immediate sue-cessor was Zebudah (2 Kings 23:31 and 2 Kings 23:36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Put him down; Hebrew, וַיְסִירֵהוּ; i.e. deposed him (Revised Version). At Jerusalem. In something more than three months Pharaoh-Necho seems to have been returning, and in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. The parallel (2 Kings 23:31) tells us that he put Jahoahaz \"in bands\" at \"Riblath in the land of Hamath\" (Ezekiel 19:4). And condemned the land; i.e. inflicted a fine on the land; Hebrew, וַיַּעֲנשׁ. From this time nothing further is heard of Jehoahaz or Shallum.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Eliakim. The meaning of the word is \"God sets up;\" the meaning of Jehoiakim is \"Jehovah sets up.\" An Egyptian king knew and recognized the word \"God,\" but possibly meant to taunt the \"Jehovah\" of the Jew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Here we note the age of Jehoiakim as greater than that of Jeoahaz, and in the parallel we read that his mother was different.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgainst him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon. Our mere allusions in this and the following verse to Nebuchadnezzar's relations to Jehoiakim and Judah are strange in comparison with the graphic account furnished by the parallel (2 Kings 24:1-6). The name is the same with Nabokodrosoros, is written in the Assyrian monuments Nebu-kuduri-utzur, and meaning, \"Nebo (Isaiah 46:1), protector from ill,\" or \"protects the crown.\" In Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:28) we have the name written Nebuchadrezzar, as also in Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar, second King of Babylon, was the son of Nabopolassar, who took Nineveh B.C. 625, and reigned above forty years. Though we are here told he bound Jehoiakim in chains, to take him to Babylon, for some reason or other he did not carry out this intention, and Jehoiakim was put to death at Jerusalem (Jeremiah 12:18, 19; Jeremiah 36:30; Ezekiel 19:8, 9). The expedition of Nebuchadnezzar was B.C. 605-4 (Daniel 1:1; Jeremiah 25:1), and during it, his father dying, he succeeded to the throne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - (Comp. Daniel 2:2.) The temple here called his temple was, no doubt, the temple of Belus, or in the vernacular \"Merodach,\" the Babylonian god of war. This rifling of the sacred vessels of Jerusalem's temple for Babylon's temple was the significant beginning of the end for Judah now at last, after many a warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim. As our compiler has literally told us none at all, we need but note his expression here as a convenient formula, indicating his own intentional brevity, and the fact that he was privy to all in the original sources, which he nevertheless now omitted; yet see Jeremiah 7:9; Jeremiah 19:13, etc. The telling expression, what was found in him, is too readily to be filled up from the parallel, in its vers. 3, 4. Jehoiachin his son. In 1 Chronicles 3:16 he is called Jeconiah, and in Jeremiah 22:24 he is called Coniah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Eight years old. Our text, not the writer, is in error, and the parallel furnishes the correction, \"eighteen years old.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When the year was expired; i.e. at the beginning of the new year, in spring (2 Chronicles 24:23). It appears, from 2 Kings 25:27-30, that the captivity of Jehoia-chin, which thus began, lasted thirty-seven years, till B.C. 561, past the end of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and that he was thenceforward kindly treated by Evil-Merodach. Compare particularly with this verse the parallel in its vers. 10-16. Zedekiah his brother; i.e. not adopting the very generic usage of the terms of relationship, so common in Old Testament language, his uncle. His mother (Hamutal, ver. 18 of parallel) was the same with the mother of Jehoahaz. Ten years old evidently when Jehoiakim began his reign, he must have been thirteen years younger than his whole brother Je-hoahaz. Zedekiah's name was before Mat-taniah. The account of Zedekiah in the parallel (which see) is very much more full.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTZedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet. Very numerous passages in the Book of Jeremiah (21-51.) illustrate both this clause and generally the feeble character and uncertain career of Zedekiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He also rebelled against... Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God (Elohim). The criticism of the Prophet Ezekiel upon this oath-violation on the part of Zedekiah is to be found Ezekiel 17:12-20; Ezekiel 21:25. Unto the Lord God of Israel. Note here the resorting on the part of the Jew to the name, Jehovah. It is not this name that is used at the commencement of the verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This, with the following three verses, may be regarded as the formal and final indictment of the people of Judah, and may be compared with that of Israel (2 Kings 17:6-23). All the chief of the priests (see 1 Chronicles 24:1, 3-19). The heads of the twenty-four courses there spoken of, with the high priest added, sum up the twenty-five men of Ezekiel 8:16, the entire of which chapter may well be read with the present history, and its description of the culminating pitch of wickedness of king, priests, and people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - His messengers.

Note marginal references (Jeremiah 25:9-12; Jeremiah 29:10). The three score and ten years of desolateness may probably best be dated from Nebuchadnezzar's first taking of Jerusalem, B.C. 606-5. Although this date does not tally exactly with the B.C. 538 of Cyrus's conquest of Babylon, yet the discrepancy is easily explained on more than one sufficiently natural supposition (e.g. that Cyrus's reign was not exactly synchronous in the beginning of it with his conquest of Babylon, etc.).

A period of half a century has elapsed between the latest date of the foregoing verses (circ. B.C. 586) and the date signalized here (circ. B.C. 5.38-6). With the proclamation of Cyrus begins in fact the manhood, with all its mystic, its wonderful, and its still non-progressing struggles, of the Jew. His simple childhood, wilful youth, am indeed for ever gone. But he and his nation are with unspeakably painful travail born. No life of nation that is or ever has been merits the devout observation and study that this unchal-lengeably does. Our present verse and the one succeeding it are, sentence for sentence, the same with the opening verses of the Book of Ezra, which may possibly once have joined on to Chronicles, as one work, though we think this exceedingly unlikely. Cyrus (the כורֶשׁ of the Hebrew text) was the son of a royal Persian, Cambysses; his mother was Mandane, daughter of Astyages, last King of Media. The name appears on the monuments, written Kurus. Cyrus defeated his grandfather Astyages, B.C. 559; ending thereby the Median royal line; and he defeated Croesus, B.C. 546, possessing himself thereby of the kingdom of Lydia; he took Babylon, as above, B.C. 538. He himself died in battle, B.C. 529. That the word of the Lord by... Jeremiah might be accomplished (see Jeremiah 25:11-14; Jeremiah 29:9-11). The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. The fact is told us, and this, no doubt, as on a thousand other unsuspected occasions of far more intrinsic and vital interest in the Bible, is sufficient. It would have been interesting to know, however, even here, the mode in which Cyrus was appealed to; as, e.g., it has been plausibly suggested that Daniel may have been in part instrumental in the work, and that, again, in part perhaps by directing the attention of Cyrus to Isaiah 44:28; Isaiah 45:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles36:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Hath the Lord God of heaven given me... the Lord his God be with him. The adopting by Cyrus of the Hebrew \"Jehovah\" in both these places cannot escape our notice. There can be no room to doubt that Cyrus was acquainted with the sacred literature of the Hebrews, and especially with the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as with the language of Daniel. It may have been partly a graceful act on the part of Cyrus to word his proclamation to the Jews thus, or it may have been simply, what under the circumstances came most naturally to him, with little or no intention in it either way. The numerous passages in Ezra parallel in matter with this verse do not need specification here. Now begins the new period of Jewish life, with fiercer probation, with unbounded and various trial, and probably of world-length continuance.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Mount Moriah. This name מוריָה occurs twice in the Old Testament, viz. here and Genesis 22:2, in which latter reference it is alluded to as \"the land of Moriah,\" and \"one of the mountains\" in it is spoken cf. Whether the name designates the same place in each instance is more than doubtful. In the present passage the connection of the place with David is marked. Had it been the spot connected with Abraham and the proposed sacrifice of Isaac, it is at least probable that this also would have been emphasized, and not here only, but in 2 Samuel 24:17-25 and 1 Chronicles 21:16-26; but in neither of these places is there the remotest suggestion of such fame of old belonging to it. Nor in later passages of history (e.g. Nehemiah's rebuilding, and in the prophets, and the New Testament), where the opportunities would have been of the most tempting, is there found one single suggestion of the kind. There am also at fewest two reasons of a positive and intriusic character against Solomon's Moriah being Abraham's - in that this latter was a specially conspicuous height (Genesis 22:4), and was a secluded and comparatively desolate place, neither of which features attach to Solomon's Moriah. Nevertheless the identity theory is stoutly maintained by names as good as those of Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 475); Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 152); Hengstenberg ('Genuineness of Pentateuch, 2:162, Ryland's tr.); Kurtz ('History of O. C.,' 1:271); and Knobel and Kalisch under the passage in Genesis - against Grove (in Dr. Smith's ' Bible Dictionary'); Stanley (' Sinai and Palestine,' p. 251;'Jewish Church,' 1. 49); De Wette, Bleek, and Tischendorf [see 'Speaker's Commentary,' under Genesis 22:2]. Though there is some uncertainty as to the more exact form of the derivation of the name Moriah, it seems most probable that the meaning of it may be \"the sight of Jehovah.\" Where the Lord appeared unto David his father. The clause is no doubt elliptical, and probably it is not to be mended by the inserting of the words,\" the Lord,\" as in our Authorized Version. We do not read anywhere that the Lord did then and there appear to David, though we do read that \"the angel of the Lord\" appeared to him (2 Samuel 24:16, passim; 1 Chronicles 21:15, 19, passim). Nor is it desirable to force the niph. preterite of the verb here, rightly rendered \"appeared\" or \"was seen,\" into \"was shown.\" We should prefer to solve the difficulty occasioned by the somewhat unfinished shape of the clause (or clauses) by reading it in close relation to 1 Chronicles 22:1. Then the vivid impressions that had been made both by works and words of the angel of the Lord caused David to feel and to say with emphasis, \"This is the (destined) house of the Lord God,\" etc. In this light our present passage would read, in a parenthetic manner, \"which (i.e. the house, its Moriah position and all) was seen of David;\" or with somewhat more of ease, \"as was seen of David;\" and the following \"in the place,\" etc., will read in a breath with the preceding \"began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem... in the place,\" etc. David had prepared (so 1 Chronicles 22:2-4). In the threshing-floor of Ornan (so 2 Samuel 24:18; 1 Chronicles 21:15, 16, 18, 21-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - In the second day. The word \"day\" as italicized in our Authorized Version type is of course not found in the Hebrew text. Several manuscripts fail also to show the other words of this clause, viz. \"In the second;\" and that they are probably spurious derives confirmation from the fact that neither the Arabic nor Syriac Versions, nor the Septuagint nor Vulgate translations, produce them. In the second month, in the fourth year. Reading the verse, therefore, as though it began thus, the most interesting but doubtful question of fixing an exact chronology for what preceded Solomon's reign is opened. In our present text there is little sign of anything to satisfy the offers to do so, if only again to disappoint the more grievously. There we read of \"four hundred and eighty years\" from the Exodus to this beginning of the building of Solomon's temple. Now, this latter date can be determined with tolerable accuracy (viz. as some twenty years before B.C. 1000) by travelling backwards from the date (n.c. 536) of Cyrus taking Babylon, and the beginning of the return from the Captivity ( B.C. 535), making allowance for the seventy years of the Captivity, the duration of the line of separate Judah-kings, and the remanet, a large one, of the years of Solomon's reign. All this, however, helps nothing at all the period stretching from the Exodus to the beginning of the building of the temple. And the events of this period, strongly corroborated by other testimony (see Canon Rawlinson, 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. it. pp. 575, 576), seem to show convincingly that no faith can be reposed in the authenticity of the chronological statement of our parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now these. Perhaps the easiest predicate to supply to this elliptical clause is are the measures, or the cubits. Was instructed. The verb is hoph. conjugation of יָסַד to \"found;\" and the purport of the clause is that Solomon caused the foundations of the building to be laid of such dimensions by cubit. Ezra 3:11 and Isaiah 28:16 give the only other occurrences of the hoph. conjugation of this verb. Cubits after the first measure. This possibly means the cubit of pre-Captivity times, but at all events the Israelites' own ancient cubit - perhaps a hand-breadth (Ezekiel 43:13) longer than the present, or seven in place of six. The cubit (divided into six palms, and a palm into four finger-breadths) was the unit of Hebrew lineal measure. It stands for the length from the elbow to the wrist, the knuckle, or the tip of the longest finger. There is still considerable variation in opinion as to the number of inches that the cubit represents, and considerable perplexity as to the two or three different cubits (Deuteronomy 3:11; Ezekiel 40:5; Ezekiel 43:13) mentioned in Scripture. One of the latest authorities, Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., pp. 56-59, 371, 386), gives what seem to be reasons of almost decisive character for regarding the cubit of the temple buildings as one of sixteen inches. The subject is also discussed at length in Smith's ' Bible Dictionary,' 3:1736 - 1739. And the writer finally concludes to accept, under protest, Thenius's calculations, which give the cubit as rather over nineteen inches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The porch... an hundred and twenty. The \"porch\" (אוּלָם, Greek, ὁ πρόναος). It is out of the question that the porch should be of this height in itself. And almost as much out of the question that, if it could be so, this should be the only place to mention it by word or. description. There can be no doubt that the text is here slightly corrupt, and perhaps it is a further indication of this that, while the parallel contains nothing of the height, this place fails (but comp. our ver. 8) to give the breadth (\"ten cubits\"), which the parallel does give. The words for\" hundred\" and for \"cubit\" easily confuse with one another. And our present Hebrew text, מֵאָה וְעִשְׂרִים, read עְמות עְשֵׂרִים, will make good Hebrew syntax, and be in harmony with the Septuagint (Alexandrian), and with the Syriac and Arabic Versions. This gives the height of the porch as 20 cubits, which will be in harmony with the general height of the building, which was 30 cubits. Thus far, then, the plan of the temple is plain. The house is 60 cubits long, i.e. 20 for the holy of holies (דְּבִיר or קֹדֶשׁ קָדָשִׁים);40 for the holy place (הֵיכָל); and for breadth 20 cubits. The porch was in length the same as the breadth of the house, viz. 20 cubits, but in breadth it was 10 cubits (1 Kings 6:3) only, while its height was 20 cubits, against a height of 30 cubits for the \"house\" (1 Kings 6:2). Overlaid it within with pure gold; i.e. covered the planks with gold leaf, or sometimes with plates of gold (Ovid., 'L Epp. ex. Pont,' 1:37, 38, 41, 42; Herod., 1:98; Polyb., 10:27. § 10). The appreciation, as well as bare knowledge, of gold belonged to a very early date (Genesis 2:12). The days when it was used in ring or lump (though not in coin) for sign of wealth and for purposes of exchange, and also for ornament (Genesis 13:2; Genesis 24:22; Genesis 42:21), indicate how early were the beginnings of metallurgy as regards it, though much more developed afterwards (Judges 17:4; Proverbs 17:3; Isaiah 40:19; Isaiah 46:9); and show it in the time of David and Solomon no rare art, even though foreign workmen, for obvious reasons, were the most skilful workers with it. There are four verbs used to express the idea of overlaying, viz.NEWLINENEWLINE(a) חָפָה, in hiph. This occurs only in this chapter, vers. 5, 7, 8, 9; but in niph. Psalm 68:13 may be compared.NEWLINENEWLINE(b) עָלָה in hiph. This occurs in the present sense, though not necessarily staying very closely by it; in 2 Chronicles 9:15, 16, and its parallel (1 Kings 10:16, 17); and perhaps in 2 Samuel 1:24. The meaning of the word, however, is evidently so generic that it scarcely postulates the rendering \"overlay.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(c) צָפָה in piel. This occurs in our present verse, as also in a multitude of other places in Chronicles, Kings, Samuel, and Exodus. The radical idea of the verb (kal) is \"to be bright.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(d) רָדַך in hiph. This occurs only once (1 Kings 6:32). No one of these verbs in itself bespeaks certainly of which or what kind the overlaying might be, unless it be the last, the analogy of which certainly points to the sense of a thin spreading.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The greater house; i.e. the holy place. He ceiled. This rendering is wrong. The verb isNEWLINENEWLINE(a) given above (ver. 4). It is repeated in the next clause of this very verse as \"overlaid,\" as also in vers. 7, 8, 9. The generic word \"covered\" would serve all the occasions on which the word occurs here. From a comparison of the parallel it becomes plain that the meaning is that the crone structure of floor and walls was covered over with wood (1 Kings 6:7, 15, 18). That wood for the floor was fir (1 Kings 6:15), probably slim for the walls, which must depend partly on the translation of this ver. 15. It would seem to say that (beside the stone) there was an inner stratum, both to walls and floor, of cedar (reason for which would be easy of conjecture). But another translation obviates the necessity of this inner stratum supposition, rendering \"from the floor to the top of the wall.\" According to this, while the overlaying gold was on cedar for walls and ceiling (1 Kings 6:9), it was on fir for the floor, which does not seem what our present verse purports, unless, according to the suggestion of some, \"fir\" be interpreted to include cedar. Set thereon palm trees and chains. These were, of course, carvings. The chains, not mentioned in the parallel (1 Kings 6:29; but see 1 Kings 7:17), were probably wreaths of chain design or pattern. Easier modern English would read \"put thereon.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He garnished. The verb employed is (e) of ver. 4, supra (Revelation 21:19). Precious stones. The exact manner in which these were applied or fixed is not stated. What the precious stones were, however, need not be doubtful (1 Chronicles 29:2; the obvious references for which passage, Isaiah 54:11, 12 and Revelation 21:18-21, cannot be forgotten. See also Ezekiel 27:16; Song of Solomon 5:14; Lamentations 4:7). For beauty; i.e. to add beauty to the house. Parvaim. What this word designates, or, if a place, where the place was, is not known. Gesenius ('Lexicon,' sub vet.) would derive it from a Sanskrit word, purva, meaning \"oriental.\" Hitzig suggests another Sanskrit word, paru, meaning \"hill,\" and indicating the \"twin hills\" of Arabia (Prof., 6:7. § 11) as the derivation. And Knobel suggests that it is a form of Sepharvaim, the Syriac and Jonathan Targum version of Sephar (Genesis 10:30). The word does not occur in any other Bible passage (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. it. p. 711).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And graved cherubim. In the parallel this statement is placed in company with that respecting the \"palms and flowers.\" Layard tells us that all the present description of decoration bears strong resemblance to the Assyrian. There can be no difficulty in imagining this, both in other respects, and in connection with the fact that foreigners, headed by the chief designer Hiram, had so large a share in planning the details of temple workmanship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The most holy house. The writer proceeds from speaking of \"the greater house\" (ver. 5), or holy place, to the \"holy of holies.\" The parallel (1 Kings 6:20) adds the height, as also 20 cubits. Six hundred talents. It is impossible to assert with any accuracy the money value intended here. Six hundred talents of gold is an amazing proportion of the yearly revenue of 666 talents of gold, spoken of in 1 Kings 10:14. This latter amount is worth, in Keil's estimate, about three million and three quarters of our money, but in Peele's estimate nearer double that! The Hebrew, Phoenician, and Assyrian unit of weight is the same, and one quite different from the Egyptian. The silver talent (Hebrew, ciccar, כִּכָּר) contained 60 manehs, each maneh being equal to 50 shekels, and a shekel being worth 220 grains; i.e. there were 3000 shekels, or 660,000 grains, in such talent. But the gold talent con-rained 100 manehs, the maneh 100 shekels, and the shekel 132 grains, making this gold talent the equivalent of 10,000 shekels, or 1,320,000 grains. The \"holy shekel,\" or \"shekel of the sanctuary,\" could be either of gold or silver (Exodus 38:4, 5). (For some treatment of this still unsatisfactory subject, see Dr. Smith's . Bible Dictionary,' 3:1727-1736; and Conder's ' Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., pp. 64-78, 81.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The weight of the nails, fifty shekels of gold. According to the above scale, therefore, this weight would be a twelve-thousandth part for the nails of all the weight of the overlaying plates of gold. The upper chambers. This is the first mention of these \"chambers\" in the present description, but they have been alluded to by the Chronicle writer before, in 1 Chronicles 28:11. What or where they were is as yet not certainly ascertained. Presumably they were the highest tier of those chambers which surrounded three sides of the main building. But some think they were a superstructure to the holy of holies; others, high chambers in the supposed very lofty superstructure of the porch. Both of these suppositions seem to us of the unlikeliest. It would, however, be much more satisfactory, considering that all the subject before and after treats of the most holy place, to be able to connect this expression in some way with it, nor is there any reason evident for overlaying richly with gold the aforesaid chambers (2 Chronicles 9:4 compared with 2 Chronicles 22:11) of the third tier.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Image work. The word in the Hebrew text (צַעֲצֻעִים) translated thus in our Authorized Version is a word unknown. Gesenius traces it to \"an unused\" Hebrew root צוַע, of Arabic derivation (meaning \"to carry on the trade of a goldsmith\"), and offers to translate it \"statuary\" work with the Vulgate (opus statuarium). The parallel (1 Kings 6:23) gives simply \"wood of oil\" (not \"olive,\" Nehemiah 8:15), i.e. the oleaster tree wood. It is obvious that some of the characters of these words would go some way to make the other unknown word. But it must be confessed that our text shows no external indications of a corrupt reading.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Twenty cubits. This, like all the preceding cubit measurings of the temple foundations and heights, and with all the succeeding cherubim measurings, is the exact double of that observed by Moses (Exodus 37:6-9). The height of the cherubim, ten cubits, not mentioned in our text, is given in the parallel (1 Kings 6:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Their faces were inward; Hebrew, \"were to the house,\" viz. to the holy place. The position of these cherubim, both as to wings and faces, was clearly different from that of those for the tabernacle of Moses. There they \"cover the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces are one to another... toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim\" (Exodus 25:20; Exodus 37:9). May this alteration in the time of Solomon indicate possibly one more advance in the developing outlook of Divine mercy to a whole world? Neither this place nor the parallel makes it certain whether the cherubim, that are here said to stand on their feet, stood on the ground, as some say they did. As regards those of the tabernacle, the prepositions used in Exodus 25:18, 19 and Exodus 37:7, 8 appear to lay stress on their position being a fixture at and on each extremity of the mercy-seat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen (so Exodus 26:31, 33, 35; Exodus 36:35; Exodus 40:3, 21). It is remarkable that our parallel (1 Kings 6.) does not make mention of the veil, though a feature of which so much was always made (Matthew 27:51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45; Hebrews 6:19; Hebrews 9:3). On the other hand, it is remarkable that our present passage does not make mention of the folding \"doors of olive tree,\" which, with \"the veil,\" intercepted the approach to the oracle (1 Kings 6:31, 32), nor of the partition walls (1 Kings 6:16) in which they were situate, nor of the \"partition chains [1 Kings 6:21] of gold before the oracle.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thirty and five cubits. The height of these pillars is attested in three places to have been 18 cubits (1 Kings 7:15; 2 Kings 25:17; Jeremiah 52:21). Some therefore think that the height given in our text describes rather the distance of the one pillar from the other, which would be just 35 cubits, if they stood at the extreme points of the line of the porch front; since the wings on each side (5 cubits for the lowest chamber, and 2.5 cubits for the thickness of the walls) would make up this amount. It is further noticed with this explanation that their height (18 cubits) with the chapiters (5 cubits) added, would bring them to the same height as the porch, and that their ornamentation agrees with that of the porch (1 Kings 7:19). All this may be the case. Yet considering other indications of uncertainty about our text, and the fact that the characters yod kheth (18) are easily superseded by lamed he (35), it is perhaps likelier that we have here simply a clerical error. The parallel place tells us that these pillars and the chapiters were cast of brass; that \"a line [1 Kings 7:15; Jeremiah 52:41] of twelve cubits [not seven] did compass either of them about;\" that the ornamentation of each chapiter was \"a net of checker-work, and a wreath of chain-work;\" that upon the five cubits of chapiter there was another \"four cubits of lily-work,\" etc. If this last feature apply to the two pillars, and not (as some think) to the porch only, the pillars would reach a height of 27 cubits, and if it be supposed that they stood on some stone or other superstructure, it may still be that our \"thirty-five cubits\" has its meaning. Meantime the passage in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 52:41) tells us that the pillars were hollow, and that the thickness of the metal was \"four fingers.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Chains, as in the oracle. Though the writer of Chronicles has not in this description mentioned any chains as appertaining to the oracle, yet they are mentioned in the parallel. The selection of what is said has in our present text so much the appearance of haste, that this may account for the abrupt appearance of the allusion here. Otherwise the words, \"in the oracle,\" tempt us to fear some corruptness of text, scarcely safely removed by Bertheau's suggestion to substitute רְבִיד (\"ring\") for דְבִיר (\"oracle\"). An hundred pomegranates (comp. 2 Chronicles 4:13; 1 Kings 7:15, 18, 20). These passages indicate that the total number of pomegranates was two hundred for each pillar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Jachin... Boaz. The margin of our Authorized Version gives with sufficient correctness the meaning of these names of the pillars, which purport to set forth the safety and sure strength that belong to those who wait on, and who calmly and constantly abide by, the Divine leading. The latter, however, is one word, a substantive, not a compound of preposition, pronoun, and substantive; and the former, though by derivation the future of the hiph. conjugation of the verb הוּן, is established as a substantive in its own right.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - An altar of brass. This in worthier material superseded the temporary altar of the tabernacle (Exodus 27:1, 2), made of shittim wood, and its dimensions five cubits long and broad and three cubits high. Large as was the present altar of brass as compared with the altar that preceded, it fell far short of the requirements of the grand day of dedication (1 Kings 8:64). No statement of the making of this altar occurs in the parallel. The place of it would be between vers. 22 and 23 of 1 Kings 7. But that Solomon made it is stated in 1 Kings 9:25, and other references to its presence are found in 1 Kings 8:22, 54, 64, etc. The position given to the altar is referred to alike in 1 Kings 8:22 and 2 Chronicles 6:12, 13, as in the court of the temple. It may be well to note that the altar, sacrifice, comes first, and is first spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A molten sea. The Hebrew of this verse and of 1 Kings 7:23 are facsimiles of one author, except that here קָו stands, where the parallel shows קוה, probably the fruit merely of some error in transcription. Verses like these point not to the derivation of Chronicles from Kings, but rather of both from some older common source. This sea of brass superseded the laver of the tabernacle (Exodus 30:18, 28; Exodus 31:9; Exodus 35:16; Exodus 39:39). It was called a sea on account of its size. We are told in 1 Chronicles 18:8 whence David had drawn the supplies of metal necessary for this work. The size of the diameter measured from upper rim to rim (ten cubits) harmonizes, of course, to all practical purposes, with that of the circumference (thirty cubits); it would assist questions connected with the contents of this large vessel, however, if we had been told whether the circumference were measured at the rim, or, as the form of language here used might slightly favour, round the girth. (For these questions, see ver. 5 below.) This sea for the washing of the priests significantly follows the altar. Beside the general suggestion of the need of purification or sanctification, it here reminds of the fact that the earthly priest and high priest must need the purification, which their great Antitype would not need.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The similitude of oxen. The parallel gives simply \"knops\" (i.e. flower-buds) in the room of this expression, and no word \"similitude\" at all, the characters spelling the word for \"knops\" being פְּקָעִים, and those for \"oxen\" being בְּקָרִים. The presence of the word \"similitude\" strongly suggests that the circles of decoration under description showed the likenesses of oxen, not necessarily (as Patrick) \"stamped\" on the so-called knops, but possibly constituting them. For the ambiguous under it of our present verse the parallel says with definiteness, \"under the brim of it.\" There is intelligibility, at all events, in the ornamentation being of these miniature oxen, presumably three hundred in the circle of the thirty cubits. The symbolism would harmonize with that which dictated the superposition of the enormous vase on twelve probably life-size oxen. There is a general preference, however, accorded to the opinion that the present text has probably been the result of some copyist's corruption, and that the text of the parallel should be followed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The words of the Hebrew text of this verse and the parallel (1 Kings 7:25) are facsimiles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - An handbreadth. Not זֶרֶת, \"a span\" (nevertheless tabled by Conder, 'Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., p. 79, as a handbreadth, and put at eight digits, two palms, or 5.33 inches), but טֶפַח, \"the palm of the open hand,\" the breadth of the four fingers, which Thenius puts at 3.1752 inches, but Conder's table at 2.66 inches. It received and held should be translated, it was able to hold. Three thousand baths. The parallel has two thousand baths, and this latter is the likelier reading. It is, however, conceivable that the statement of Kings may purport to give the quantity of water used, and that of Chronicles the quantity which the vessel at its fullest could accommodate. As to the real capacity of the bath, we are hopelessly at sea. Josephus's estimate of it is about eight gallons and a half, that of the rabbinists about four gallons and a half (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 3:1742), and Conder, in the 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 80, a fractional quantity above six gallons. The largest bowls on the Assyrian bas-reliefs, the silver bowl of Croesus, and the bronze bowl in Scythia (Herodotus, 1:51; 4:81), did not, under the lowest estimate of the bath, hold as much as one-half of the contents of this vast sea of brass of Solomon. The use of this vessel was, as we read in the next verse, for the priests to wash in, or, as some would read, to wash at (Exodus 30:18-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This verse, with vers. 14, 15, are all here that represent the lengthy account of bases rather than layers, occupying in the parallel vers. 27-39 of 1 Kings 7, which, however, omits to state the use of either sea or layers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Ten candlesticks of gold. The only allusion to these in the parallel is found later on in part of the forty-ninth verse of 1 Kings 7. According to their form. This expression, though so vague, might point to the fact that the form of the old candlestick of the tabernacle was adhered to (Exodus 25:31). But considering the recurrence of the same words (ver. 20), there can be no doubt that the phrase is identical in its meaning with the use found in such passages as Leviticus 5:10; Leviticus 9:16, and means \"according to the prescribed ordinance,\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Ten tables. These tables also (the use of which is given in ver. 19) are not mentioned, so far as their making is concerned, in the parallel, except in its summary, ver. 48 (cf. 1 Kings 7.), where furthermore only one table, called \"the table\" (Exodus 25:23), is specified, with which agrees our 2 Chronicles 29:18. It is hard to explain this variation of statement. It is at least an arbitrary and forced explanation to suppose that ten tables constituted the furniture in question, while only one was used at a time. Keil and Bertheau think that the analogy of the ten candlesticks points to the existence of ten tables. The question, however, is, where is the call for, or where are the indications of any analogy? An hundred basins of gold. The Hebrew word employed here, and translated \"basins,\" is מִזְרְקֵי, as also vers. 11, 22, infra; and 1 Kings 7:40, 45, 50; Exodus 27:3; Exodus 38:3; Numbers 4:14; but it is represented as well by the English translation \"bowls\" in 1 Chronicles 28:17; 2 Kings 25:15; Numbers 7:13, 19, etc. The \"pots,\" however, of our vers. 11, 16 has for its Hebrew הַסִּירות. It were well if, in names such as these, at any rate, an absolute uniformity of version were observed in the translation, for the benefit of the English reader, to say nothing of the saving of wasted time for the student and scholar. These basins, or bowls, were to receive and hold the blood of the slain victims, about to be sprinkled for purification (see Exodus 24:6-8, where the word אַגָּן is used; Exodus 29:12, 10, 20, 21; Leviticus 1:5, and passion; Hebrews 9:18-20; see also Exodus 38:3; Numbers 4:14,) The Hebrew word מִזְרָק, whether appearing in our version as\" basin\"' or \"bowl,\" occurs thirty-two times, sixteen in association exactly similar with the present (viz. Exodus 27:3; Exodus 38:3; Numbers 4:14; 1 Kings 7:40, 45, 50; 2 Kings 12:13; 2 Kings 25:15; 1 Chronicles 28:17; 2 Chronicles 4:8, 11, 22; Nehemiah 7:70; Jeremiah 52:18, 19; Zechariah 14:20), fourteen as silver bowls in the time of the tabernacle for the meat offering of \"fine flour mingled with oil\" (vie. Numbers 7:13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 84, 85), and the remaining two in an entirely general application (Amos 6:6; Zechariah 9:15). It is evident, therefore, that the מִזְרָק was not the only vessel used for holding the blood of purification, nor was it exclusively reserved to this use.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFurthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The court of the priests (comp. 1 Kings 6:36, where this court is denominated the inner court, and any other court an outer one, i.e. the great court only implicated thereby). The construction of this court of the priests, withheld here, given there, leaves it ambiguous whether the \"three rows of hewed stones and one row of cedar beams \"intends a description of fence, as the Septuagint seems to have taken it, or of a higher floor with which the part in question was dignified. The citation Jeremiah 36:10, though probably pointing to this same court, can scarcely be adduced as any support of J. D. Michaelis' suggestion of this latter, as its עֶלְיון (translated \"higher\") does not really carry the idea of the comparative degree at all. For once that it is so translated (and even then probably incorrectly), there are twenty occurrences of it as the superlative excellentiae. The introduction just here of any statement of these courts at all, which seems at first inopportune, is probably accounted for by the desire to speak in this connection of their doors and the brass overlaying of them (1 Kings 7:12; 2 Kings 23:12; 2 Chronicles 20:5; Ezekiel 40:28; Condor's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 370). It is worthy of note that the word employed in our text, as also 2 Chronicles 6:13, is not the familiar word חַצֵר of all previous similar occasions, but עֲזרָהַ, a word of the later Hebrew, occurring also several times in Ezekiel, though not in exactly the same sense, and the elementary signification of the verb-root of which is \"to gird,\" or \"surround.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The right side of the east end, over against the south (so also 1 Kings 7:39; comp. Exodus 30:18). The sea found its position, therefore, in the place of the tabernacle laver of old, between altar of brass and porch. It must be remembered that the entrance was east, but it was counted to a person standing with the back to the tabernacle or temple, as though he were, in fact, going out, not entering in, the sacred enclosure; therefore on the right side will be southward, as written in this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The pots. As stated above, the Hebrew word is הַסִּירות. It occurs in the Old Testament twenty-seven times; it is translated in our Authorized Version \"pans\" once and \"caldrons\" four times. By a manifest copyist's error, the parallel (1 Kings 7:35) has כִירות, \"layers,\" by the use of caph for samech. The use of the סִיר was to boil the peace offerings, though some say they were hods in which to carry away the ashes; and it certainly is remarkable that it is no one of the words employed in 1 Samuel 2:14. In addition to these twenty-seven times, it occurs also four times in Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, Hosed, Nahum, with the meaning of \"thorns,\" and once in Amos it is translated \"fish-hooks.\" The passage in Ecclesiastes (Ecclesiastes 7:6) is additionally remarkable, in the fact that the root occurs twice in the same sentence in its different significations, e.g. \"the crackling of thorns under a pot.\" The shovels. The Hebrew word is הַיָעִים. This word occurs in the Old Testament nine times - in Exodus, Numbers, Kings, Chronicles, and Jeremiah. The use of the shovel was to remove the ashes. The basins should very probably read flesh-hooks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The pommels. The Hebrew word is גֻלֹת, translated in the parallel \"bowls.\" The word occurs in the Old Testament twelve times, and is translated six times (in Judges and Joshua)\" springs,\" four times \"bowls,\" and twice \"pommels.\" It was an architectural ornament to the capital, in shape like a ball. The chapiters. The Hebrew word is כֹּתֶרֶת, occurring twenty-three times or more, and always translated thus; in modern architecture, the head or capital of the pillar. The two wreaths. The word is כֹּתֶרֶת, occurring fifteen times, and translated seven times \"net-work,\" five times \"wreath,\" or \"wreathen-work,\" once a \"snare,\" once \"checker-work,\" and once a \"lattice.\" These wreaths were of some lace pattern plaiting and festoons of fancy chain-work. The fuller expression of them is found in 1 Kings 7:17, though in description not more distinct, certainly - \"nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Four hundred pomegranates. This number of pomegranates substantially agrees with the parallel (1 Kings 7:20), There were two hundred of them on each wreath that encircled the chapiter. The pomegranate was a favourite ornament in work as well as in more solid architectural forms (Exodus 28:33, 34). The popularity of the fruit as food (Numbers 13:23; Numbers 20:5; Deuteronomy 8:8; Joshua 15:32; Joshua 21:25), its simple beauty to the eye (Song of Solomon 4:3, 13), and its welcome homeliness, will quite account for this beside any symbolic significance that may have become attached to it. The description of the pomegranate as a fruit may be found in any Bible dictionary, but especially in Tristram's 'Natural History of the Bible.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Bases. The first mention of these in Chronicles, on which so much is said in the parallel (1 Kings 7:27-39). The Hebrew word is מְכונָה, occurring eighteen times in Kings, twice in Chronicles, once in Ezra, and three times in Jeremiah. These bases were, as may be learnt more fully in the parallel, pedestals of brass four cubits square by three and a half high, supported by wheels a cubit and a half in diameter. The pedestals were richly decorated with mouldings, and with the similitudes of lions, oxen, and cherubim, and with other subordinate ornamental work, and were designed to bear the layers, the use of which is given in ver. 6. Vers. 6-16 in our chapter strongly suggest, in their repetitiousness, the writer's resort to different sources and authorities for his matter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne sea, and twelve oxen under it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Flesh-hooks. Hebrew, מִזְלָגוח, occurring twice in Exodus (Exodus 27:3; Exodus 38:3), once in Numbers, and twice in Chronicles. Another form of the same root, מַזְלֵג occurs twice in Samuel, in the same sense of \"flesh-hook\" (1 Samuel 2:13, 14), where also its use is made dramatically plain. Huram his father; i.e. his chief artist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In the plain... in the clay; i.e. in the Ciccar (or round, equivalent to the New Testament \"region round about \") of Jordan, a distinctive designation of the Jordan valley (Conder's Handbook to the Bible,' p. 213). The region here intended lies east of the river, in what became the division of Gad. Succoth lay a little to the north of the river Jabbok, which flows almost east to west into the Jordan. Zeredathah; i.q. Zarthan of 1 Kings 7:46; and this latter is in the Hebrew also the same in characters and all with the Zaretan of Joshua 3:16. Very possibly the place is the same as Zererath (Judges 7:22). The exact sites of these places are not known, though the range within which they all lay is clear (see Grove's article in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1817). The clay ground; that is,\" the clay of the ground \"(Hebrew). The radical idea of the word here translated \"clay\" is \"thickness,\" which should not be rendered, as in margin, \"thicknesses.\" The word (עָב) occurs in all thirty-five times, and is rendered a large proportion of these times \"clouds\" or \"thick clouds\" (e.g. Exodus 19:9), clouds being presumably thicknesses in air; but if the subject-matter in question be in wood, or growing timber, or the ground, the word is rendered conformably \"thick planks\" (1 Kings 7:6; Ezekiel 41:25, 26), or \"thickets\" (Jeremiah 4:29), or \"clay\" (as here), to distinguish from other lighter or more friable soil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Candlesticks... lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle. Ten candlesticks, as we learn here and in ver. 7, supersede in Solomon's temple the one candlestick, with its central shaft lamp, and the three branch lamps on either side of Moses and the tabernacle (Exodus 25:31-37; Exodus 37:17-24; Leviticus 24:4; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:06. § 6, 7; Maimonides [1135-1205], \"De temple, vasis sanctuarii,\" etc.). This single candlestick was restored in Zerubbabel's temple. The present ten candlesticks, or strictly candelabra, of Solomon are said at one time to have been placed in a row like a rail before the veil, and connected with a chain under which the high priest went on the Day of Atonement into the inner sanctuary. The removal of these candelabra is recorded Jeremiah 52:19. The expression, \"after the manner,\" points to the various and somewhat minute regulation for the lighting, trimming, and keeping alight of the lamps, all or some, of the candelabra (Exodus 27:19-21; Leviticus 24:1-3). The use of the word for \"lamp\" (נֵר) in some passages (1 Samuel 3:3; 2 Samuel 21:17; Proverbs 13:9; Proverbs 20:27; Psalm 18:29)suggests not the part as used for the whole in speaking of the candelabrum, but more probably that the perpetual burning was not of all seven lamps, but of one, the central shaft.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The flowers; Hebrew, פֶרַה, occurring sixteen times, of which number it is translated\" flowers \"thirteen times, \"buds\" twice, and \"blossom\" once. The flower was a part of the ornamentation of the branches of the candelabrum (Exodus 25:31, 33). The tongs; Hebrew, מֶלְקָחַיִם, occurring six times, of which number it is translated five times \"tongs,\" but once \"snuffers\" (Exodus 37:23). This latter is the correcter translation, perhaps. The instrument, at any rate, was to trim the lamp-wicks (Exodus 25:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The snuffers; Hebrew, מְזַמְרות, occurring five times, and always translated \"snuffers.\" A slightly different form of the word is translated \"pruning-hooks \"four times in the Prophets Isaiah, Joel, Micah. No doubt these snuffers were something different from the tongs of the preceding verse; the use of one may have been rather to cut the wicks, and the other to trim them. The spoons; Hebrew, כַפ. This is the word used so often for the \"hand,\" but the essential idea of which is the hollow of either hand or foot or other thing, and among other things of a spoon shape. The word is used of the frankincense-cups (Numbers 7:14, 20, 26) brought to the dedication of the tabernacle by the several princes. The censers; Hebrew, מַחְתּות. These were \"snuff-dishes\" (Exodus 25:38; Exodus 37:23; Numbers 4:9). The entry of the house; Hebrew, פֶּתַח. Some think this word refers to the door-frames, as distinct from the door-leaves or doors themselves. But the parallel (1 Kings 7:50) gives us what is translated as \"hinges\" (Hebrew, פות), a word that occurs only here in any such sense, as presumably (Gesenius, ' Lexicon ') \"the hollowed part of a hinge,\" and Isaiah 3:17 for the pudenda muliebria. The mistaken transcribing of a kheth for a tau will amply account for the difference.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The things that David... had dedicated; literally, Hebrew, the holy things; i.e. the dedicate or set apart things of David. The temple-building, which had been commenced in Solomon's fourth year, had occupied seven years in construction (1 Kings 6:1), but another thirteen years in furnishing (1 Kings 9:1, 2). The record of Chronicles is, of course, in some respects somewhat more sketchy than that of Kings; and the correct view of the chronology has in both writers to be sought and read between the lines. It was when the house and \"all the work designed for the house of the Lord was finished,\" that (ver. 2) \"Solomon assembled the elders,\" etc., and arranged for the solemn dedication; that is, when four years of his reign, and seven years of building and thirteen years of furnishing, etc., had elapsed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Comparing the language of this and the following verse with that used on the occasion of David's bringing up of the ark to Zion, found in 2 Samuel 6:1; 1 Chronicles 13. and 15, some have thought that a considerable difference of tone is perceptible, and that indication is given of the intention, or at any rate a feeling, even if more or less unconscious, on the part of Solomon, that times were ripe for a demonstration, that should partake less of the enthusiasm of the mass, so far as his own summons might be concerned, and more of the form and dignity of the chief and representative men of the nation. This view can hardly be pressed. The very word \"wherefore\" in ver. 3 goes far to discredit it. And any difference that may be apparent in the language is far more probably and easily attributable to the old cause of the narrower, though intenser, interest of the writer of Chronicles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - In the feast which... in the seventh month; i.e. the Feast of Tabernacles.

So see Numbers 4:15, 19, 20, which, with our vers. 5, 7, throw this statement into sufficient harmony with that of the parallel (1 Kings 8:3), which purports to say that the priests only, unaided by the Kohathite Levites, performed the service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In the parallel (1 Kings 8:4), the \"and\" in the last line of this verse does not need the italic type, but is found in the Hebrew text, confirming our version of ver. 4 foregoing. The tabernacle of the congregation; or, tent of meeting, designs here the tabernacle of Moses from Gibeon (comp. 1 Kings 3:4; 1 Samuel 21:6; 1 Chronicles 16:39, 40; 2 Chronicles 1:3), and not the tent of Mount Zion (2 Samuel 6:17). This tabernacle, then, and these holy vessels all, are carried into the new temple, as venerated relics and sacred mementoes of a memorable past of vicissitude. But the ark had still its ministry to perform (ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - King Solomon and all the congregation... sacrificed; i.e., of course, with the intervention of their priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The wings of the cherubim (see 2 Chronicles 3:10). Their situation was by the west wall of the oracle (1 Kings 6:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They drew out; i.e. the staves projected. A similar intransitive occurs in Exodus 20:12. Were seen from the ark. The words, \"from the ark,\" are here probably by misposition, and should follow the words, the staves projected; while the parallel tells us what should be in their place here, namely, \"from the holy place\" (1 Kings 8:8). The confusion and omission will merely lie with some copyists, for five manuscripts show the words \"from the holy place.\" There it is unto this day. The parallel (1 Kings 8:8)reads, \"there they are unto this day,\" i.e. the staves. In either case, whether the ark or the staves were spoken of, the memorandum is exceedingly interesting and noteworthy, as a patent bare copy of an old record dating before the destruction of the temple, on the part of whether the writer of Kings or Chronicles. Plainly the historian touches ground, and shows us that we do also; for it is evident that, far from cunningly devised fable, he has before him in either case an original document.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Nothing in the ark save the two tables (see Deuteronomy 10:5; and Exodus 40:20; then Exodus 24:12; 25:16; 31:18; 32:19; 34:1, 4, 29; 40:20). The stones were therefore now, in Solomon's time, nearly four hundred and ninety years old. Why the \"golden pot\" and \"Aaron's rod\" (Hebrews 9:4) were not there does not appear. The language of the Epistle is partially confirmed, at any rate in harmony with Exodus 16:34; Numbers 17:10. Possibly they may have now been removed by Solomon, but it seems very unlikely that, if so, no mention of the removal is made. On the other hand, the \"book of the Law\" had not been consigned to the ark, but to a place \"by the side of\" it (Deuteronomy 31:25-27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The parallel (1 Kings 8:10) shows the first half of this verse and the last sentence of ver. 13 to make its tenth verse. All between these two is special to the present passage and to Chronicles. All the priests... not by course; i.e. all of all the courses, twenty-four in number, instead of only the one course on daily duty at the time (1 Chronicles 23:6-32; 1 Chronicles 24:1-31). Present; or, found more literally; that is to say, all who were not for one cause or another out of reach (1 Chronicles 29:17; Ezra 8:25). The Hebrew word is the familiar הַגִּמְצְאִים.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This verse, marked off in the Authorized Version in brackets, is most graphic. First all the priests, who were not hors de combat, i.e. all the \"courses\" of them together, thronged the arena; and now they are joined by all the Levites who were singers, of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun (1 Chronicles 25:1-31), i.e. twenty-four choirs in one, with their sons and their brethren; and this collected choir is arrayed in white linen; and they have three kinds of musical instruments - cymbals (Psalm el. 5) and psalteries (or lutes) and harps (1 Chronicles 16:5; 1 Chronicles 25:1); and they take up their station at the east end of the altar, and still further a strong support flanks these of a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets (1 Chronicles 16:6). So ends our inopportune Authorized Version parenthesis. But to what all this? It is a scene in a nation's history, in the universal Church's history; it is witnessed from heaven, and by Heaven's will recorded in the book on earth, which will endure through all generations, as long as the sun and moon endure, as ushering in the moment when, as described in the next verse, to the unanimous fervent adoration and praise of man, God bent a willing, gracious ear, and to earth the glory of heaven drew nigh. Cymbals. The word used here (מְצִלְתַּים), denoting strictly \"pair of cymbals,\" occurs eleven times in Chronicles, once in Ezra, and once in Nehemiah. Another form of essentially the same word occurs once in 2 Samuel 6:5 and twice in Psalm 150:5. This last passage notes two kinds of cymbals - the \"loud\" and the \"high-sounding.\" It was the former of these that Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun used, and their use was probably to regulate or beat the time (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:375, 376; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 167, 2nd edit.). Psalteries (נֶבֶל). This word occurs twenty-eight times in the Old Testament, but of these it is translated (Authorized Version) four times as \"viols\" (Isaiah 5:12; Isaiah 14:11; Amos 5:23; Amos 6:5); it is also once rendered \"vessels of flagons\" (Isaiah 22:24), but the margin offers the version \"instruments of viols.\" While the cymbal was, of course, an instrument of percussion, the psaltery was one of strings - its use was as an accompaniment to the voice. The first mention of it is very interesting (1 Samuel 10:5). Compare also David's and Solomon's psaltery in 2 Samuel 6:5; 2 Chronicles 9:11. Harps (כִּנּור). This word occurs forty-two times, beginning with Genesis 4:21. Trumpets (חֲלֺצצְרָה). This word (including eleven of the personal forms of it, as e.g. the person blowing the trumpet) occurs just forty times, beginning with Numbers 10:2. It was the straight tuba, and was not, therefore, the same with the ram's-horn shaped buccina (שֹׁפָר), generally rendered in the Authorized Version \"cornet,\" but sometimes \"trumpet;\" the specialty of the cornet being to blow a sound for a signal or summons of some sort, whether secular as in war, or sacred as for some festival. The trumpets of our verse evidently (Numbers 10:8) were in a particular sense the instrument of the priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - It cannot but be that it was intended in this verse that attention should be rivetted to the fact of the splendid consentaneity of all singers and all musicians, of hearts and voices and instruments. The suggestion is as significant as it is impressive, a suggestion to the Church of all time, and supremely asking notice now. Even the house. The close of ver. 14, as also the parallel (1 Kings 8:11 ), justifies the supposition that the Septuagint showing the word δόξης, guides us rightly in restoring the word \"glory\" (כְבוד) here, in place of the word \"house\" (בֵּית). For he is good (so 1 Chronicles 16:34; Psalm 136:1; 2 Chronicles 7:3; Ezra 3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud (so Exodus 40:34, 35).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the thick darkness; Hebrew, מַּעֲרַפֶל. The Lord had said this in so many words, and also by not a few practical examples (Leviticus 16:2; Exodus 19:9; Exodus 24:16; Exodus 25:22; Exodus 40:34, 35). This thing which he said, and did, even while really instructing, after the manner of special revelation, a specialized people, is essentially what he ever has said and ever is doing in all time, in all the world, and in all nature and providence. It is a fact and it is necessary that his glory be for the present veiled in \"clouds and darkness\" (Psalm 97:2; Psalm 18. n).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Solomon's words now address themselves to God. For ever. These words refer rather to the permanence and station-ariness of the temple as the dwelling-place of the ark. and the mercy-seat and cherubim, and all that symbolized and invited the Divine presence, than design any prophecy of length of time. They contrast with the wandering people, and wandering worship and sacrifices, and wandering tent and tabernacle with all their sacred contents (Psalm 68:16; Psalm 132:14; 1 Chronicles 22:10; 1 Chronicles 28:6-8; 2 Samuel 7:5-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Reading between the lines, this verse shows us that the face of Solomon had been turned to the symbol of God's presence, while he addressed to him the words of our second verse, since he now faces round to the assembly of the congregation. What words Solomon used in thus blessing the whole congregation are not given either here or in the parallel. The impression one takes is that the blessing was, in fact, wrapt up tacitly in all that Solomon recounts, when he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, etc. (ver. 4). However, it is not impossible that, with the variation of the tense in ver. 59, the verses of 1 Kings 8:55 - 61 may contain the substance of it, if not itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - (See 2 Samuel 7:4-17; 1 Chronicles 11:2; 1 Chronicles 17:4-14.) With his hands,... with his mouth. Expressions like this, antithesis and all, remind how language formed itself in the concrete mould at first, from that, ever becoming more abstract as time grew. The ampler language of later date would be, Who hath indeed fulfilled that which he spake.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSince the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I chose no city,... neither chose I any man. The tabernacle and all it contained had but travelled from place to place, and rested at temporary halting-places; and from Moses' time all the leaders of the people Israel had been men in whom vested no permanent and no intrinsic authority (1 Samuel 16:1-15; 2 Samuel 24:18-25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - (See again references of preceding verse, and 2 Samuel 7:8; Psalm 78:70.)

To the \"performing of the Lord\" the glory is all given (Luke 1:54, 55, 68-72). Probably delivered from earthly feeling, and sheltered just now from self and human ambition, Solomon was in a very high degree \"in the spirit\" (Revelation 1:10) on this great day. The moment was a proud moment in Solomon's history, as well there may be proud moments in men's lives, but it was divinely shielded, as divinely inspired. Hereafter, for all that, \"the thorn in the flesh\" might become very necessary, lest Solomon \"be exalted above measure\" in the memory of all that had transpired.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Before the altar. This means to say that Solomon stood (and afterwards knelt down) eastward of the altar indeed, but with his face to the temple and congregation. Although the voice of Solomon was raised in prayer to God, yet the prayer was to be that of the whole congregation and not of priestly proxy, and therefore of the whole congregation it must be heard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A brazen scaffold. The Hebrew word is כִּיּור. The word occurs twenty-one times. It is translated, in the Authorized Version, \"laver\" eighteen times, once \"pan\" (1 Samuel 2:14), once \"hearth\" (Zechariah 12:6), and once \"scaffold,\" here. The meaning evidently is that the stand was in some sort basin-shaped.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - No God like thee, etc. The quoting of Scripture and the utilizing of language in which the religious feeling of those who have gone before has expressed itself had plainly set in (Exodus 15:11, 12; Deuteronomy 7:9). The prayer which this verso opens occupies twenty-eight verses; it is the longest prayer recorded in Scripture. It consists of two verses (14, 15) of opening; then follow three petitions - first, that God would perpetuate the line of David (ver. 16); next, that he would have regard to the place where his Name is put (vers. 17-20); and thirdly, that he would hear the prayers addressed to him toward this place (ver. 21). Of this last subject, seven different cases are propounded - firstly, the case of the man wronged by his neighbour (vers. 22, 23); secondly, of the people worsted by their enemies (vers. 24, 25); thirdly, of the people suffering from drought (vers. 26, 27); fourthly, of the people visited by death or special calamity (vers. 28-31); fifthly, of the stranger who comes to offer to pray (vers 32, 33); sixthly, of the people going to war by God's permission (vers. 34, 35); seventhly, of the people in captivity (vers. 36-39). Then the prayer closes in vers. 40-42.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - There shall not fail thee, etc. (so 2 Samuel 7:12; 1 Kings 2:4; 1 Kings 6:12).

Heaven and the heaven of heavens. Solomon's conception of the infinite God comes plainly to view here (2 Chronicles 2:6; Deuteronomy 10:14; Psalm 139:5-12; Psalm 148:4; Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:4-9; Acts 17:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This house .... the place whereof;... this place (so Exodus 29:43; Deuteronomy 12:5; Deuteronomy 14:23; Deuteronomy 15:20; Deuteronomy 16:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The supplications of thy servant. \"The great thought of Solomon now is that the centre and core of all worship is prayer\" (Professor Dr. James G. Murphy, in 'Handbook for Bible Classes: Chronicles'). Toward this place (see other instances of this expression, Psalm 5:7; Psalm 28:2; Psalm 138:2; Jonah 2:4; Daniel 6:10). From thy dwelling-place. 1 Kings 8:30 has, \"hear to thy dwelling-place, to heaven,\" by probably the mere error of a copyist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And an oath be laid upon him to make him swear. This verse is explained by Exodus 22:9-11; Leviticus 6:1-5. The case of ordeal by self-purgation of oath is supposed. And the oath come. The Septuagint translates here, \"and he come and declare by oath,\" etc. - a translation which a very slight alteration in the Hebrew, consisting in prefixing a vau to the word for swear, will allow. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The prayer is that God will command his blessing on the oath ordeal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - (See Leviticus 26:3, 17, 33, 40; Deuteronomy 27:7, 25; also Deuteronomy 4:27, 29-31; 28:64-68; 30:1-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - No rain (see 1 Kings 17:1; Leviticus 26:19; Deuteronomy 11:17; Deuteronomy 28:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - When thou hast taught them; rather, when thou art guiding them to the right way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-31. - (See Leviticus 26:16-26; Deuteronomy 28:22-52, 59; ch. 20:9.) In the cities of their land. This, to represent correctly the Hebrew, should read, in the land of their gates. Reference probably is being made to the fact that law and justice and judgment were administered \"in the gate of the city\" (Deuteronomy 16:18; Deuteronomy 21:19; Joshua 20:4). Thou only knowest (so 1 Chronicles 28:9). That they may fear thee (so Psalm 130:4). In the absence of a healthy fear is involved both the absence of a healing hopefulness, and too probably the presence of recklessness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - The stranger... come from a far country for thy great Name's sake. These two verses, with every clause in them, must be felt most refreshing by every reader; but they ought also to be particularly observed, as both corrective of a common but strictly erroneous impression as to exclusiveness and a genius of bigotry inhering in the setting apart of the Jewish race for a certain purpose in the Divine government and counsel, and also as revealing very significantly that that setting apart was nothing but a method and means to an end, as comprehensive and universal as the world itself The analogies, in fact, in the world's history are linked, in one unbroken chain, to what sometimes seems to a mere reader of the Bible pages as an artificial and somewhat arbitrary decree or arrangement (see, amid many significant parallels, Exodus 22:21; Leviticus 25:35; Numbers 15:13-17; Deuteronomy 10:19; Deuteronomy 31:12). Not of thy people Israel (John 10:16; John 12:20-26; Acts 8:27). For thy great Name's sake. The insertion of the adjective \"great\" here (גָּדול) is not Pentateuchal, but is found in Joshua 7:9; in our parallel, 1 Kings 8:42; Psalm 76:1; Psalm 99:3; Ezekiel 36:23; Jeremiah 10:6; Jeremiah 44:26. All people of the earth. Not only are many of the psalms utterly in harmony with the spirit of this verse, but also the light of it is reflected brilliantly in such passages as Acts 17:22-31. This house is called by thy Name; literally, thy Name is called upon (or perhaps, into) this house, meaning that God himself is invoked there, or present there in order that he may be constantly invoked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - The different supposition of these verses, compared with vers. 24, 25, is plain. Here we are reminded how right it is to implore a blessing before we go out to our allotted labour, or even on some specially and divinely appointed enterprise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36-39. - The matter of these verses is given fuller in the parallel (1 Kings 8:46-53). The prayer is remarkable all the more as the last of the whole series, and one so sadly ominous! The last clause of ver. 36, carrying the expression far off, as the alternative of near, throws its lurid glare of unwelcome suggestion on all the rest. No man which sinneth not. The words need the summoning of no biblical parallels, for these are so numerous. But out of the rest emphasis may be placed at least on those furnished by Solomon himself - Proverbs 20:9; Ecclesiastes 7:21; both of which are particularly sententious. Bethink themselves. The words well express, in English idiom, the literal Hebrew, as in margin, \"bring back to their heart\" (Deuteronomy 30:1-11). Have sinned, ... done amiss,... dealt wickedly (so Psalm 106:6; Daniel 9:5). The Authorized Version in the parallel (1 Kings 8:47) is somewhat happier in its rendering of the three verbs employed here. It seems doubtful whether these have it in them to form a climax; more probably they speak of three different directions in wrong going. The parallel is well worthy of being referred to, in its vers. 50, 51.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 40-42. - These three verses are wanting in the parallel, which has kept us four verses (50-53) not shown here. Our two verses 41 and 42 are doubly interesting, first, as almost an exact copy of the words of David (Psalm 132:8-10); and secondly, as not an entirely exact copy, in some respects the form of word not being identical, though the signification is the same, and in other respects the clause being not identical, though still the meaning is essentially equal.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles6:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.VERSEENDNEWLINE","2Chr.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When Solomon had made an end of praying. See the parallel, 1 Kings 8:54, which verse, however, in a sense, disappoints us; for, beginning with these same words, it does not go on at all to tell of this second occurrence of the fire and the cloud and the glory. The fire came... and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices. So Leviticus 9:24, when the tabernacle was consecrated. The closing verses of our ch. 5, compared with the first verse of ch. 6, and in particular the first word of that verse, \"then,\" leave it quite open to conjecture that the demonstration of the fire and the glory of the Lord had not ceased, but was continued during the prayer of Solomon, though at its close they may have been marked with added brightness, and then wrought their sacrifice-consuming work. Such supposition may bring us nearest to some tenable explanation of what otherwise seems the very unaccountable omission in the parallel. The language of our ver. 2 adds something to countenance this theory, coinciding as it does with the language of the last verses of ch. 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For he is good (so 2 Chronicles 5:13; 1 Chronicles 16:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - These two verses bring us again into company with the parallel in its vers. 62, 63. Let it be noticed that in both these verses the compiler of Chronicles avoids the words, \"all Israel,\" and \"all the children of Israel;\" in favour of all the people. The parallel tells us that the sacrifices in part were peace offerings, eatable, therefore, by priests and people. Large as the numbers of the oxen and sheep sacrificed, yet indications in the narrative round about do something to sustain them, as e.g. the number of people who had come together; the fact that all the people are said to offer sacrifices; the fact that Solomon, Because of the press for room (ver. 7), hallowed the middle of the court, i.e. probably the court itself, in order to find place for the \"burnt offerings, meat offerings, and fat\" (ver. 7); further, the number of mouths of people that certainly would need filling, not only on one day, but on days more than one, while on the third day (Leviticus 19:6) any part of a peace offering still left was to be destroyed by fire. Nevertheless, the thought of the scene of butchery is, to our modern imagination, amazing to the last degree. An assemblage of people in Jerusalem, all making also for its temple, of a hundred and twenty thousand people, and a minimum of another twenty-two thousand people, is startling; but add to these a sheep apiece for the former number, and an ox apiece for the latter (a computation itself necessarily under the mark), and allow several days to be covered by the- killing and sacrificing, and one feels that the key and explanation of the present words of the Bible text in this very passage are scarcely in hand. The interesting note in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on 1 Kings 8:63 scarcely assists us. Its instances of the \"profusion\" of the \"sacrifices of antiquity\" are altogether and immensely distanced by the narrative before us, not only in the number of victims, but in respect of the time in which the victims had to be despatched and disposed of, and the place and space within which, if not the slaughtering, yet certainly the offering, had to be done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This verse is not found in the parallel (2 Chronicles 5:12, 13; 1 Chronicles 15:16; 1 Chronicles 23:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Also at the same time... the feast; i.e. the Feast of Tabernacles, which occupied the seven days from the fifteenth to the twenty-second of the month Tisri (Leviticus 23:33). Thus fourteen days (1 Kings 8:65)were occupied by the two feasts, that of the temple consecration and that of Tabernacles, while on the fifteenth day of feasting, viz. the twenty-third of the month Tisri, or Ethanim (the seventh month), the people went home. The entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt; i.e. from the extreme north to the extreme south of the land. The town Hamath was on the Orontes, through the valley of the Lebanon (Joshua 13:3, 5; also Numbers 13:21; Numbers 34:8; Judges 3:3; 2 Kings 14:25; 1 Chronicles 13:5; Amos 6:2, 14). The river of Egypt; or, the river before Egypt (Joshua 13:3), was the Shihor, or Sihor, separating Egypt and Judaea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Solemn assembly. The word thus translated in the Authorized Version occurs (including both its but very slightly differing forms) eleven times. Five of these times the margin offers, probably unnecessarily, the optional rendering of \"restraint.\" It may be that the root involves this idea, and certainly the word is especially used for the seventh or closing day of Passover, and eighth or closing day of Tabernacles; but other occasions of its use seem to negative this as an essential element in the signification or essential condition of the use of the word; e.g. \"Proclaim a solemn assembly\" (2 Kings 10:20); \"Call a solemn assembly\" (Joel 1:14; Joel 2:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - (See now for the parallel 1 Kings 9:1-9.) The king's house... the house of the Lord... his own house. The expressions that we have in this verse guide us amid some ambiguities to the correct date of the consecration of the temple. The verse purports to speak of the final completion the temple and the king's house or palace, with all whatsoever that was necessary to them in the matter of their furnishing. And, to say the least, the impression naturally produced on the reader is that they are spoken of as being thus completed simultaneously, although, beyond doubt, there was a sense in which the temple was (not utterly finished but) built long before the palace. Accordingly, when the next verse tells us of God's answer vouchsafed to the dedication prayer of Solomon, we are not driven to the supposition that several years had elapsed since the final completion of the temple and the dedication of it on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, a similar interval lost between the dedication prayer and the Divine acknowledgment of it. It may be again stated that the main structure of the temple (not including courts, pillars, furnishing, vessels, etc.) was built after seven years' process, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, but the palace only after another complete twelve years (1 Kings 7:1), in Solomon's twenty-fourth year. A liberal study of the parallel narrative of Kings in its entirety strengthens considerably this view, inasmuch as there the whole account of the palace-building finds its place previous to the account of the dedicating of the temple. However, though there can be little practical doubt as to how the facts of the case stood and stand, yet this occasion must count one to be added to the chronological memorabilia of Scripture, in that, while both the accounts to which we have access leave very vague the very things we should naturally expect to have been stated concisely, they also both seem entirely unconscious of it - a directest outcome of the fact that both writers were but picking their own way in the midst of borrowed material, neither of them the original historian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - See 1 Kings 3:5; 1 Kings 9:2; Deuteronomy 12:2, 3, 5-7, 11, 14; and, by turning to the last of these sets of references, the emphasis laid here upon the house as the house of sacrifice will be amply accounted for without supposing a rather premature aside as regards synagogues. Meantime, what a feature, manifestly, the sacrifices were!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-15. - These three verses (the counterparts of 2 Chronicles 6:26, 28, 40) are not in the parallel. Although we can scarcely trace the principle of their selection from the seven parts of the prayer, they would seem to have been selected from the original work, as samples of a reply which presumably embraced reference to all the seven. When, in ver. 14, it is said, I will heal their land, the telling expression, according to the Authorized Version, must be understood to refer to the removing of drought by rain. On the other hand, the Authorized Version is, in ver. 15, unfortunate in the unnecessary and misleading insertion of the italics found there, and in the use of the preposition \"in\" for of, the simple case construct, which is manifestly what is wanted and intended. It was not absolutely essential that prayer should be made in the place. How many references there are to prayer being made from a distance toward the place!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - This verse glances, as an answer to the contents, or spirit of the contents, of the second petition at 2 Chronicles 6:18-21. The beautiful touching condescension in the wording of the last clause, Mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually, will not escape notice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - These two verses glance at the first petition of Solomon's prayer (2 Chronicles 6:15-17).

The parallel (1 Kings 9:6) puts it, according to the Authorized Version, \"If ye shall at all turn from following me,\" etc., which rendering on the part of the Authorized Version probably errs by excess. Much mercy, much forbearing, long-suffering, and slowness to anger, were sure to mark the Divine rule; nor would condemnation take effect, nor did it take effect, till the revolt of the people was a thorough revolt, as finally testifying itself in the crucifixion of Christ (see also, as comments on the expressions of these two verses, Leviticus 26:14; Deuteronomy 4:26, 27; Deuteronomy 28:37, and generally 15-64). The same Hebrew words for a proverb and a byword among all nations are found in ver. 37, as just quoted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The Hebrew text of the first sentence of this verse differs here from that in the parallel; but, in fact, neither text reads satisfactorily and smoothly. The parallel (1 Kings 9:8) inserts the little word \"at,\" though without italics, and \"which\" in italic type. The \"at\" is no doubt intended to be condoned as supposed to belong to the word astonished; the following verb hiss also permitting, though not requiring, the appendage. Not leaning to the text of the parallel (which shows no אֲשֶׁר, and which shows the substantive verb in the future tense יִהְיֶה), we need not find any particular difficulty in rendering our present text, And this house, which is most high (the word well favours this idea), shall be an astonishment to every passer by. The Septuagint reads simply, \"This lofty house.\" Why hath the Lord done this? (see Deuteronomy 29:24; Jeremiah 22:8, 9). To the \"astonishment\" prophesied here the parallel adds, \"shall hiss\" - in a forcible expression found first in 2 Chronicles 29:8, and afterwards in Micah (Micah 6:16)and in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 18:16; Jeremiah 19:8; Jeremiah 25:9, etc.; Lamentations 2:15, 16).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINE","2Chr.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - (parallel, 1 Kings 9:10). - Twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord, and his own house. The description is intended to be, what it is, chronologically exact. Four years of Solomon had passed when he began the Lord's house, seven were spent in building it, thirteen in finishing and furnishing it, and in building, finishing, and furnishing the king's house - in all twenty-four years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The cities which Huram had restored to Solomon. 1 Kings 9:11 explains the force of the word \"restored\" here, telling how it was Hiram had come by \"twenty cities in the land of Galilee\" by way of payment, or part payment, for the \"cedar,\" \"fir,\" and \"gold\" which he had given Solomon. It is evident that these cities were in need of repair; possibly they had not been previously in the occupation of the Israelites; if they had been, the transaction was scarcely legitimate on the part of Solomon (Leviticus 25:12-33), and we may suppose they had become largely deserted when made over to Hiram. It would not, however, be necessary to suppose either that Solomon had given them because they were poor property in his eyes, or that Hiram, whose good will and generous disposition are elsewhere specially notified, had returned them as a thankless gift or as a bad payment, but for the language of vers. 12, 13 (1 Kings 9.), which distinctly tells us that when Hiram inspected them they did \"not please him,\" and that he named them \"the land of Oabul\" (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 237). The probability is that, as cities on the borderland, they were what had been at present unoccupied by Israelites, were all the likelier in bad repair, and, unvalued by Hiram, were, when put into good repair by Solomon, such that Solomon might justly cause the children of Israel to dwell in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Hamath-zobah. Hamath (when the name occurs separately) was a place both of great geographical note (occupying, whether regarded as a larger region or a town, an important position in the northern end of that broad valley of Coele-Syria which separates Lebanon and Antilebanon, and through which passed the river Orontes) and of great historical note from the time of the Exodus to that of Amos. The town, or city, is to be understood to be the Great Hamath (Amos 6:2). But the kingdom, or district, or county, was almost conterminous with Coele-Syria. Zobah, also a portion of Syria, amounted to a small kingdom, and is read of alike in Saul's and in David's times, as in Solomon's time. It probably lay to the north-east of Hamath (1 Samuel 14:47; 2 Samuel 8:8, 7, 8, 10; 2 Samuel 10:9, 16, 19; 1 Chronicles 18:4; 1 Chronicles 19:16). But Hamath-zobah of this verse was probably a place called Hamath, in the region of Zobah, in which also two other cities are mentioned, Berothai and Tibhath, or Betah (2 Samuel 8:8; 1 Chronicles 18:8). These two kingdoms of Hamath and Zobah, contiguous as they were, seem as though they purposed to compliment one another - Zobah by naming one of its towns Hamath, and vice versa It is said that the Assyrian inscriptions show that they remained, after Solomon, distinct kingdoms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Tadmor in the wilderness. Tadmor, one with the classical Palmyra, lay in the desert of Syria, about half-way between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates, and distant from Damascus about a hundred and forty miles to its east-north-east. Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 8, note 1) says, \"Is it quite certain that 'Tadmor' and 'Palmyra' are words derived from the (palms)? A palm is in Hebrew tamar... and in Greek... phoenix.\" Solomon was probably not the originator, but rather re-builder, of the place. Its fame was great under Zenobia, the Queen of Odenathus; she was taken captive by the Emperor Aurelian, A.D. 273, when the city was subdued. It is now little better than the haunt of a few Arabs Splendid ruins remain, specially of the great temple of the sun. The Hebrew text of 1 Kings 9:18 has apparently Tamer, or Tamar, and it has been suggested by Movers on that passage that possibly a Tamar in the south, and that is found in the neighbourhood of some of the other places, such as Baalath, Beth-heron, and Gezer, all in the south (Ezekiel 47:19; Ezekiel 48:28; ch. 20:2), is intended. Our text, however, in the present place offers no choice, while that in Kings (compare Chethiv and Keri) is doubtful. And finally, our writer is here evidently in the neighbourhood of Hamath, which of course best suits Tadmor. Although there is an apparent disjointedness between this and the parallel, closer notice may rather bring confirmation of substantial agreement between them. For instance, the store cities here spoken of as belonging to Hamath (but not individually named here and not corresponding with those that are named in Kings) are accounted for by the words, \"and in Lebanon,\" in 1 Kings 9:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Beth-heron the upper... Beth-heron the nether. The parallel mentions only the latter (1 Kings 9:17). They were both in Ephraim (1 Chronicles 7:24; Joshua 10:10, 11; Joshua 16:1-6; Joshua 18:13, 14), but were assigned to the Kohathite Levites (Joshua 21:22; 1 Chronicles 6:68). The name means \"the hollow place.\" The upper Beth-heron was about four miles from Gibeon, and the lower about three miles further on. The Roman general Cestius Gallus was defeated here in the last Jewish war; Judas Maccabaeus conquered here (1 Maccabees 3:18-25). Other interesting references may be made to 1 Samuel 13:18; 1 Kings 9:7; 2 Chronicles 25:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Baalath (parallel 1 Kings 9:18). This place belonged to Dan (Joshua 19:40-45). Nothing is known about it; some take it to be one with Baalah of Joshua 15:9, 10. Store cities... chariot cities... cities of the horsemen (see 2 Chronicles 16:4; 2 Chronicles 32:28; 1 Kings 4:26; 1 Kings 9:19). In the parallel some of the names of the places built, or rebuilt, or repaired by Solomon in this connection are given as \"Mille and the wall of Jerusalem\" (Millo's foundations occupied the hollow at the south-west corner of the hill of the temple), \"and Hazer and Megiddo and Gezer\" (1 Kings 9:15). All that Solomen desired to build; i.e. for purposes of personal enjoyment or ornament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - These verses, corresponding very nearly exactly with the parallel (1 Kings 9:20-23), betray how it was a thing never to be forgotten, if only as a fact, that the extermination of the old possessors of the land had not been entire; so that allusion to it is not omitted even by a post-Captivity compiler. The parallel charitably \"whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy utterly,\" where our text shows with exacter fidelity, whom the children of Israel consumed not. The parallel also uses the words, \"levy a tribute of bond-service,\" for our more ambiguous make to pay tribute (Judges 3:1-7). In the words, until this day, the copyist, shall we say, too slavish, is again detected (ver. 9). The \"levy \"in ver. 21 of the parallel probably explains the suddenly mentioned similar language of its fifteenth verse, and again betrays the collected and copied nature of the historic material, the carefulness of sequence not being as observable in selection as might be desired. The distinction between the remnant of aliens and the people of Israel was manifestly that the menial and the laborious service was put on the former. Useful but familiar references to this whole subject are found in Judges 1:21-36; Judges 3:1-5; 1 Chronicles 22:2; 1 Kings 5:13-18. For our two hundred and fifty (which gives the number of overseers over Israelites only) the parallel reads, \"five hundred and fifty.\" It will be remembered that an analogous difference occurs between our 2 Chronicles 2:18 and 1 Kings 5:16. Whether it were the determining reason or not in these two places, it is very imaginable that it would be of less importance in the ages of the post-Captivity annalist to dwell on the minutiae of the different treatment of the aliens.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11 (parallel, 1 Kings 9:24). - As the writer of Chronicles has not before alluded to the marriage and the circumstances of it involved in this verse, his account and assignment of Solomon's motive for the removal of his wife, Pharaoh's daughter, is given something more specifically (see 1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings 7:8). The valley of Tyropeum lay between the temple on the eastern hill and Solomon's palace, which was on the western side of it.

(For the particulars of this verse, see, with the exposition to them, 1 Chronicles 24:1-35; 1 Chronicles 25:1-7; 26; 9:17-28.) David the man of God. This title occurs only once in 1 Chronicles, viz. 1 Chronicles 23:14, where it is used of Moses; and six times in 2 Chronicles, viz. here to David; 2 Chronicles 11:2, to Shemaiah; three times, 2 Chronicles 25:7, 9, to an unnamed prophet; and once again to Moses, 2 Chronicles 30:16; the expression occurs much more frequently in Kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Considering the last clause of the previous verse, the king probably designs David, not Solomon.

The evident signification is, Thus was all the work of Solomon steadily ordered to the day of foundation of the house... and on uninterruptedly till it was finished; i.e. there was no remitting of diligence and care from the beginning to the end of the grand undertaking.

But it is almost impossible to see how he could do so. The parallel much helps us, by saying that \"Solomon made a navy,\" and Hiram assisted. by manning it with competent sailors; he \"sent in the navy his servants,\" etc. (1 Kings 9:26, 27). Some have suggested that the explanation is that Hiram gave materials, workmen, and models for Solomon's ships, possibly having ships lying in the Red Sea. The parallel, however, meets all difficulties, and saves the necessity of going far for farfetched explanations. Ophir. This was the name of the son of Joktan (Genesis 10:25-29), who, it is supposed, gave his name to the place or land in the south of Arabia. It is still quite an unsettled question, however, where Ophir was situated, though an Arabian situation is on every account the most probable (see Exposition 1 Chronicles 29:4; and Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:637-642). Our four hundred and fifty talents of gold reads in the parallel (1 Kings 9:28) as \"four hundred and twenty.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","2Chr.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The parallel shows very little variation on this narrative. In its first verse it adds the words (Authorized Version), \"concerning the Name of the Lord\" (i.e. \"to the glory of God\"), after the words, the fame of Solomon. Sheba. This was the name of a descendant of Cush, a Hamite (Genesis 10:7; 1 Chronicles 1:9); also of a son of Joktan, a Shemite (Genesis 10:28; 1 Chronicles 1:22); also of a son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (Genesis 25:3; 1 Chronicles 1:32). It is quite uncertain who of these constituted, or preponderated in, the country of Sheba here referred to. This is probably Saba, the capital of Yemen, an important province of Arabia, west of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean, and extending upward nearly to Idumaea. The city was reputed splendid, the country wealthy, and long as the most southerly inhabited part of the world. If it were, as is believed, first occupied by Cushites it was afterwards peopled also by Joktanites and Jokahanites, as above. In addition- to the two celebrated allusions to it, ever memorable, see as other references, Job 6:19; Psalm 72:10, 15; Isaiah 60:6; Jeremiah 6:20; Ezekiel 27:22, 23; Ezekiel 38:18; Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31 (see also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1232). The hard questions consisted in riddles (Judges 14:2) and enigmas and primitive casuistry, in which the Arabians found some considerable portion of their mental gymnastics These, no doubt, bore some mild cousinly relationship to the proverbs and songs of Solomon, and his treasures of botanical and natural history facts (1 Kings 4:29-32). Spices; Hebrew, בְּשָׂמִים, here as also in the parallel. This word is used twenty-one times, and in a slightly varied form (as in the ninth verse of this same chapter) nine more times. It is almost always translated (Authorized Version) by this same word \"spice\" or \"spices\" (except Exodus 30:23; 2 Chronicles 16:14; Esther 2:12; Isaiah 3:24). There are other Hebrew words for \"spices,\" such as נְכות (Genesis 37:25; Genesis 43:11), סַמִים (Exodus 30:7), רֶקַח (Song of Solomon 8:2; Ezekiel 24:10); but the \"spice\" or \"spices\" designated by our present word, and the exact name or nature of which cannot be certainly pronounced upon, was in great request for domestic, ecclesiastical, funeral (2 Chronicles 16:14), and other purposes, and was a chief export from Arabia, Syria, and Persia. Gold in abundance. Of course, it is not necessary to suppose that the gold that came either now from Sheba, or even from Ophir, was obtained from the immediate region; as seen before, there may have been a special market or emporium for them there. Precious stones. These were used for sacred purposes, and for domestic and dress ornaments, and were graven upon in early times by the Hebrews The chief of those mentioned in the Old Testament are the carbuncle, sardius, topaz (Exodus 39:10; Ezekiel 28:13), diamond, emerald, sapphire (Exodus 39:11); Ezekiel 28:13), agate, amethyst, ligure (Exodus 39:12), beryl, jasper, onyx (Genesis 2:12; Exodus 39:6, 13; Ezekiel 28:13), ruby (Job 28:18; Proverbs 3:15), chrysolite, chrysoprasus (Ezekiel 28:13). The precious stones which the queen brought are likely enough, however, to have comprised other varieties (including the pearl from the Persian Gulf), such as Pliny describes; and see in particular 1 Chronicles 29:2; Ezekiel 27:16; and the art. \"Stones, Precious,\" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1382. All that was in her heart. The expression simply means all that she had so desired to get information upon, since she had heard of the fame of Solomon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Nothing hid from Solomon; i.e. nothing obscure to him - no question knotty for Solomon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The meat of his table (see 1 Kings 4:22, 23). Translating our thoughts rather violently into modern language, we might picture the queen inspecting the kitchens of the palace, and remember that the kitchens of an Oriental court did the work, not of an individual \"table,\" but of those of a very large domestic and official retinue; much more these of Solomon now. Keil and Bertheau, however, with others, refer this expression to the set-out of one meal-table (as e.g. that of a modern banquet, wedding breakfast, or the like), where both the abounding lading of the table and the ample variety of the courses, and the rich foreign or home fruits, in season or out of season, and the furnishing and decorating of the table, all come in to add their contribution of effect; and they quote not inaptly our ver. 20, elucidated by 1 Kings 10:21. This was a daily glory with Solomon's palace-establishment. The immediate connection and the contents of this verse, though difficult, favour this direction of explanation, as will be seen in the succeeding clauses. The sitting of his servants. The word here used (מושָׁב) occurs forty-three times, and is rendered in the Authorized Version thirty-two of these times as \"habitation\" or \"dwelling.\" Of the remaining eleven times, one or other of those words would be almost the synonym of the word used, and in every ease the rendering \"dwelling,\" if kept to the general idea of a dwelling or resting-place more or less temporary, would not be inappropriate or inconsistent with the evident drift of the connection; only here and in the parallel is the inconvenient rendering \"sitting\" adopted by the Authorized Version. Hence we disagree with Professor Dr. Murphy's explanation, the sitting, i.e. \"in council of his chief officers.\" What the nature of the location (to use a term least specific) of the servants pointed to here is, nevertheless, still not quite clear. It is evidently placed in some antithesis with the standing (i.e. the standing-place) here rendered 'inadequately or incorrectly, the attendance of his ministers. The attendance, i.e. \"the station (מַעֲמָד) (see the four other occurrences of this' word: 1 Kings 10:5; 1 Chronicles 23:28; 2 Chronicles 35:15; Isaiah 22:19). Of his ministers; Hebrew, מְשָׁרְתָיו, participle of a piel verb, שָׁרֵת. This word, in an amazing majority of the hundred occurrences of it, expresses ministry of sacred service of some kind. It may, indeed, be said that the present passage, with only one or two others, are doubtful in this meaning or character of explanation. To our next clause, referring to their apparel, we find in the parallel mention, as here, of the cupbearers, though the matter of their apparel is not included as it is here. Part of the difficulty of the verse arises from the consideration that up to this point the contents of the successive clauses of it may compose possibly enough a sharp graphic description of the daily banquet scene. An apt reference to similar description of Arabian banquets is given in the 'Speaker's Commentary ' as to be found in vol. it. pp. 213-215 of 'Ancient Monarchies.' Our next clause, however, brings us back into difficulty by its reference to Solomon's ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord (1 Chronicles 26:16 with our Exposition, 'Pulpit Commentary'), apparently so unseasonably; nor are we much helped by reading, with the Septuagint, \"the burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord.\" The obscurity and lack of coherence are not formidable, indeed, and perhaps may be with moderate satisfaction set down again to the account of the occasionally careless selection of the compilers from the material of the older work. Possibly the allusion in our ver. 11 to the terraces, or stairs, or highways (see margin) to \"the house of the Lord,\" and to the king's palace, may hold some clue to the ascent being adverted to here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHappy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The abstinence on the part of the queen in her mention of the Lord God of Israel, and of the Lord thy God, of any indication of a desire that he should become her God, is as suggestive as it is noticeable (compare Hiram's language in 2 Chronicles 2:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - An hundred and twenty talents of gold. Putting the value of gold at £4 per ounce, the value of one talent would be £5476, making a total of £657,120. Poole makes it £1,250,000; S. Clarke, f 720,000. From our vers. 13, 14 we learn that in one year Solomon received 666 talents, beside what merchants brought. Any such spice. The parallel has \"no more such abundance of spices,\" and \"of spices very great store.\" The Arabian spices, and their land and even sea borne fragrance, as also the very lucrative trade they created, are often alluded to by historians (see, among many others, Herod., 3:113; Diod., 3:46; Strabo, 16:4, § 19). Much of all this so-termed giving was evidently matter of exchange. The queen got quid pro quo, while ver. 13 of the parallel (1 Kings 10.) seems to speak of the other truer giving.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Either these two verses are misplaced (with their parallel, 1 Kings 10:11, 12), or they ought to have, though unstated, some occult bearing on the queen. There are some slight indications pointing to this, and the meaning is perhaps that the terraces, balustrades, stairs (which possibly is the idea in the \"ascent,\" ver. 4), pillars, etc., made of the wood which Hiram's and Solomon's servants had formerly brought with gold, were the artificial-work wonders which helped to astound the queen. Terraces to the house of the Lord, and to the king's palace. These so rendered terraces were probably stairs, and, as already intimated, may have composed the \"ascent\" (ver. 4), and explain the mention of it in ver. 4. The algum trees. This is the Hebrew text order of the lamed and gimel alphabet characters, as the Authorized Version order in the parallel almug is also the order of its Hebrew. The tree is mentioned only six times - three times in Chronicles (2 Chronicles 2:8; 2 Chronicles 9:10, 11) and three times in Kings (1 Kings 10:11, 12). Apparently this wood did grow in Lebanon (2 Chronicles 2:8), though we think this not certain. Kimchi thinks it was the bukkum (Arabic word), which Europeans call Brazil wood, and which (Keil) was found in Ethiopia, as well as India. Some think it the sandal-wood of Malabar. Whatever it was, it no doubt was to be purchased at the emporium of Ophir. The intrinsic nature of the wood, and its intrinsically valuable nature, may easily be inferred from its use for the woodwork and sounding-board woodwork of musical instruments like the harp and psaltery. This fact would much incline to the view that the red sandal-wood is what is here called algum. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes Max Muller ('Lectures on Language,' 1st series, p. 191) for the statement that the vernacular for this wood in India is valguka. Harps... psalteries (see our Exposition on 2 Chronicles 5:12, and articles in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and others. The sentence, there were none such seen in the land of Judah, may Be read as an indication that they had been part of the exhibition made to the Queen of Sheba.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Beside that which she had brought unto the king. The parallel has not this obscure clause, but has, \"beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal Bounty.\" Professor Dr. Murphy explains our clause as purporting to say this: Solomon gave all the queen's desire in the way of bounty, \"beside\" all that belonged as an equivalent for \"what she had brought.\" She got so much sheer gift, beside all that, according to the then Eastern custom, was her due.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Beside, etc. The preposition (In.) left both here and in the parallel, before the words \"men of,\" etc., in the compound English word chapmen (Authorized Version), shows clearly the construction of this and the following sentence; from the previous verse needs to come the words, after our \"beside,\" \"the weight of gold which came,\" etc. This gold probably came by way of tax payments from the merchant travellers, and as tribute money from the kings of the part of Arabia where the blood was mingled, Jewish and Arabian, and not exclusively and independently Arabian (see the word used in place of our Arabian in the parallel, and Jeremiah 25:24), and from those governors (perhaps in some cases superseding older kings) of adjacent countries, that had become in some part tributary to Solomon. Governors. For this unusual and un-Hebrew word (פַחות) see Ezra 5:6; Haggai 1:1; Nehemiah 5:14. Gesenius mentions Turkish, Persian, and Sanscrit derivations that would well suit it. It is very noticeable that it is employed also by the writer of Kings. It is used of a ruler in the Assyrian empire (2 Kings 18:24; Isaiah 36:9), in the Chaldean (Ezekiel 23:6, 23; Jeremiah 51:23), in the Persian (Esther 8:9; Esther 9:3), specially of the Persian governor of Judaea (Haggai 1:1, 14; Haggai 2:2, 21; Nehemiah 5:14, 18; Nehemiah 12:26; Malachi 1:8); while Gesenius reads this passage in our present text and its parallel, to speak of governors of Judaea (the country). See also 1 Kings 20:24, where the word is translated (Authorized Version) \"captains,\" and is in the Syrian king's mouth. The word is not used before Kings. It is used by the writer of Kings three times; of Chronicles, once; by Ezra, six times; in Nehemiah, eight times; in Esther, three times; in Daniel, four times; and in the remaining prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, Malachi, ten times in all. The Authorized Version, out of the whole number of these occurrences of the word, has rendered it \"captains\" thirteen times; \"deputies,\" twice; and \"governors,\" twenty times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - Targets... shields. The Authorized Version \"target\" is unfortunate, though it may with somewhat grim truth represent fact. It was a very large solid shield, originally made of some common material, as basketwork or wood, and covered with leather; these with a plate of gold. The absence of the word \"shekel\" in each clause, both here and in Kings, leaves it open to us to suppose that the beka, or half-shekel, may be the right word. Now, the maneh (see 1 Kings 10:17), or pound, meant 100 bekas, i.e. 50 shekels. Thus the targets, or shields, had six manehs of gold to their plating each, and the lesser bucklers (as we may perhaps call them) three manehs each. On the estimate that the shekel weighed 9 dwt. 3 gr., since the maneh weighed fifty shekels (100 bekas, or half-shekels), the gold to a shield (target) may be put at something over 11 lbs. troy. The house of the forest of Lebanon; i.e. an armoury (see 1 Kings 7:2-5; 2 Samuel 8:7; Song of Solomon 4:4; Isaiah 22:8). Shishak took these when he conquered Jerusalem (1 Kings 14:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-19. - It is not necessary to suppose that the throne was made of solid ivory (Psalm 45:9; Amos 3:15; Amos 6:4), or that the overlaying gold concealed the ivory, whether more or less of it. The parallel adds that \"the top of the throne was round behind\" (1 Kings 10:19). Comparing also the two accounts, it would appear that there were twelve lions on each side of the throne, i.e. two to each step. When it is said that there were two lions standing by the stays (or, arms) on each side of the sitting-place, we may easily imagine, from ancient modelled thrones, that of them the arms were themselves \"no small part.\" It is remarkable that the parallel does not take cognizance of the footstool. The lion is, of course, as natural a symbol as it is an old one of sovereign power and place; and the use of the lion and the number of them, reminding of the tribes of Israel, were specifically justified to the people, whose oracles contained such words as those in Genesis 49:9; Numbers 23:24; Numbers 24:9. Josephus tells us that a golden bull supported the seat of the throne. If so, it is remarkable that the statement should be omitted in both of our Old Testament narrations. The dimensions of the throne we might have looked for, but they are not given. That they were well proportioned to the height, marked by six steps, may be taken for granted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The house of the forest of Lebanon, The circumstance of the vessels of this house being mentioned in such close connection with the drinking-vessels of Solomon, is another indication of the close connection of the buildings themselves (1 Kings 7:1, 2-5, 6, etc.); also that these\" vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon\" were (as may be inferred naturally from the connection) like Solomon s drinking-vessels, infers the use of the apartments of the house for social or, at any rate, state occasions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - To Tarshish. The parallel has, in both clauses of its verse (1 Kings 10:22), \"ships of Tarshish.\" The order of the words in the former clause of our present verse, that compels us to read, \"going to Tarshish,\" certifies the correct meaning. The word \"Tarshish\" (the subsequent Tartessus) covered a district in South Spain, as well as named a town and river, and stretched opposite the coast of Africa. Both coasts were beneath Phoenician rule, and a voyage to Tarshish would most naturally mean calling at many a port, and many an African port, from one and another of which all the imports here spoken of would be obtainable. The meaning of the Hebrew root of Tarshish is \"to subjugate.\" The town lay between the two mouths of the river Baetis, now Guadal-quiver. Gesenius thinks that the writer of Chronicles says, in ignorance, \"to Tarshish.\" and that the ships went to Ophir! These passages do not say that the voyage, whatever it was, took three years; much less that that length of time was necessary. Whether voyages were in Solomon's time made from the Red Sea, circumnavigating Africa, into the Mediterranean, is not certain. If they were such voyages, taken at a sauntering pace, with calls at many ports and easygoing delays, they may easily have consumed as long a space of time as three years! The theory that Tarshish was Tarsus in Cilicia is easily and conclusively negatived. The names in Hebrew of \"ivory, apes, and peacocks\" have been said to be of Indian origin. This is far from proved, and, as regards the first two, may be said to be sufficiently disproved. But if it all were so, still the fact that the Hebrew names were of an Indian language derivation would go very short way to prove that the Hebrew people got the things represented by them direct, or at all, from India. Ivory; Hebrew, שֶׁנְחַבִּים. The Authorized Version rendering \"ivory\" occurs ten times in the Old Testament, having for its original the Hebrew שֵׁן (1 Kings 10:18; 1 Kings 22:39; 2 Chronicles 9:17; Psalm 45:8; Song of Solomon 5:14; Song of Solomon 7:4; Ezekiel 27:6, 15; Amos 3:15; Amos 6:4). In all these cases, two of them being in closest juxtaposition with the present and its parallel occasion, the word speaks of ivory that is being used, i.e. as though it were manufactured material or ready for manufacture. But in our passage and its parallel, where the different word given above is found, it is manifest that it speaks of the material, so to say, in the rough, as just \"tooth or tusk of ?;\" but, further, what the חַבִּים is is not yet ascertained. It is not a word known in the Hebrew vocabulary. Gesenius finds the Sanscrit ibhas, which signifies an \"elephant;\" Canon Rawlinsen finds in some Assyrian inscriptions a word habba, used of both elephant and camel, but probably having for its generic signification \"a great animal;\" Keil (on the parallel) finds a Coptic word, eboy, the Latin elephas, to which he prefixes the Hebrew article ה. The Targum Jonathan shows at once שְֵׁןאּדּפִיל. Gesenius, in his 'Thesaurus,' calls also timely attention to Ezekiel 27:15, where we read, \"They brought thee a present, horns of ivory and ebony\" (Hebrew, Chethiv, וְהָובְנִים; Keri, קַרְנות שֵׁן וְהָבְנִים). But no use of \"ebony\" happens to be mentioned in the connection of our present passages or subject. Thus it will be seen that no little ingenuity has been employed to hunt down this little word, though as yet not quite successfully. More may be seen in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:906. Apes; Hebrew, קופִים. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., p. 390) says, \"This word is identical with the name of the monkey in Tamil.\" Keil connects it with the Sanscrit kapi, but does not believe, with Gesenius, that the animal came from India, but Ethiopia. In a valuable note in the' Speaker's Commentary' we read, \"It is found\" (not stated where) \"that the word was an Egyptian word, signifying a kind of monkey, in use in the time of Thothmes II., i.e. about the time of the Israelites' exodus.\" (For Herodotus's testimony respecting ivory and apes in North Africa, see his 'Hist.,' 4:91.) Peacocks; Hebrew, תֻּכִּיִּים. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' p. 393') says a Tamil word, tokei, means \"peacock.\" Keil proposes to consider it one of the later Romans' luxurious delicacies, aves Numidicae, from Tuoca, a town in Mauretania or Numi-alia. Some translate it \"guinea-fowl,\" and some \"parrots.\" The peacock did not belong to Africa, yet still it may have been purchaseable at some port there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - All the kings of the earth; i.e. of the laud of tributary sovereignties, from Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, and to the Philistines (1 Kings 4:21; also note Genesis 15:18; Exodus 23:31; Numbers 22:5; Joshua 1:4; 2 Samuel 10:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Every man his present; Hebrew, מִנְחָתי; which word represents the treats, paid partly in money, partly in kind (2 Samuel 8:2; 2 Kings 17:3, 4; and the parallel).

Not forty thousand, as by error in 1 Kings 4:26. The parallel mentions one thousand four hundred as the number of the chariots (2 Chronicles 1:14). Both agree in twelve thousand as the number of horsemen. Chariot cities (1 Kings 9:19; 2 Chronicles 1:14). Some of the horse and chariot depots were kept near the king, but the rest in those specially chosen and prepared cities, which might be nearest or fittest against time of war-need.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27.

The all lands alluded to with us, would manifestly include Armenia (Ezekiel 27:14) and Arabia. The parallel also, in its ver. 29, states the prices of a chariot from Egypt as \"six hundred shekels [qu. bekas] of silver\" (i.e. about either £90 or £45); and of a horse for the cavalry, perhaps, not for the chariot, as \"one hundred and fifty shekels [qu. bekas] of silver\" (i.e. £22 10s. or £11 5s., estimating the shekel as worth three shillings with us). Other estimates (see 2 Chronicles 1:17) would make the prices £70 and £17 (see our Exposition, 2 Chronicles 1:15-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Nathan the prophet... Ahijah the Shilonite... Iddo the seer. For these original authorities of the history, see our Introduction (vol. 1. p. 8:2, and p. 9:3). The present quotation of the name of Ahijah in connection with his work, and the brief allusion to himself in our 2 Chronicles 10:15, are the only appearances of Ahijah in Chronicles. He and the importance of his work are clear enough from 1 Kings 11:28-40; 1 Kings 14:1-20. As the compiler of Chronicles evidently by a law omits any even reference to the defection of Solomon, it is natural that the name and special ministry of Ahijah should fall into the shade with him. Uniformly it is observable in Chronicles that the personal is not enlarged upon where it is not directly and indispensably ancillary to the ecclesiastical and national history. On the other hand, the writer of Kings does not once mention Iddo the seer, whereas we read of him again twice in Chronicles (2 Chronicles 12:15; 2 Chronicles 13:22).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART2Chronicles9:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.VERSEEND",
