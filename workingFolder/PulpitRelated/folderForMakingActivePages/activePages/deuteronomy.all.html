Directions had been given for the construction of the ark before the apostasy of the people, and it was not made till after the tabernacle had been erected, nor were the tables placed in it till the tabernacle had been consecrated (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>, etc.; Exodus 40:20).

This Moses reminds the people of by referring to a fact in their past history, viz. their arrival at Mosera, where Aaron died, and Eleazar succeeded him in his office. <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth of the children of Jaakan</span> (<span class="accented">wells of the sons of Jaakan</span>); the same place as Bene-jaakan (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31</a>), probably the Horite tribe, called 'Akan (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-27.htm">Genesis 36:27</a>), for which, apparently, should be read Jakan, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-42.htm">1 Chronicles 1:42</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Mosera</span>; Moseroth, plu. of Mosera (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>).

None of these places have been identified. Robinson mentions a Wady cf. Ghadaghidh, a broad sandy valley diverging from the Wady es Jerafeh, in the desert of Et-Tih, and this has been supposed to indicate the site of Gudgodah; but the difference of the consonants in the two words is such as to render this identification more than doubtful. In the Arabic of the London Polyglott, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span> is represented by  (<span class="accented">Judjuda</span>), which is totally different from <span class="accented">Ghadaghidh</span>. All the places, however, must have been in the 'Arabah, and in the region of Mount Her, or not far distant. That the places mentioned here are the same as those in Numbers cannot be doubted. The two passages, however, relate to different journeys; that in Numbers to the journeying of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai to Kadesh, that in Deuteronomy to the march in the fortieth year, when they went from Kadesh to Mount Her.

The appointment of the tribe of Levi for service took place in connection with that of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>). The service to which the tribe of Levi was chosen appertained to the tribe as such, including the priests as well as the non-priestly Levites, though parts of it specially belonged to the one class rather than the other. Thus the <span class="cmt_word">bearing of the ark</span> was the special duty of non-priestly Levites, the Kohathites (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a>); but was also, on peculiarly solemn occasions, discharged by the priests (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, etc.; Joshua 6:6; 8:33; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3, 6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To stand before the Lord to minister</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto him</span> was the special function of the priests (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15, 16</a>); but as the service of the Levites was also a sacred service, they too are said to stand to minister before the Lord (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4, 5, 11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bless in his name</span> does not mean, as some propose, to invoke the Name of God, or to praise his Name, but to pronounce a benediction or invoke a blessing on the people in his Name (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>). This was the special duty of the priests (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>), but might also be done by others (as by David), and in this benediction the Levites might join (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>).

There is a fear with which love cannot coexist - a fear which hath torment, and which love casts out as its antagonist (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); but the fear of God which he requires is that pious reverence which not only can coexist with love to him, but is not where love is not. <span class="cmt_word">And to serve the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</span> Love prompts to service.

Moses does not mention Korah himself here, but only his accomplices Dathan and Abiram, probably, as Keil suggests, "from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah;" perhaps also because, though Korah was at the head of the insurrection, Dathan and Abiram were the more determined, audacious, and obdurate in their rebellion (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12-15, 25, 26</a>), so that it came to be named from them.

Canaan was not like Egypt, a country that depended for its fertility on being irrigated by man's labor or by artificial processes, but was a land where the supply and distribution of water was provided for in natural reservoirs and channels, by means of which the rain which God, who cared for the land, sent plentifully on it, was made available for useful purposes. In Egypt there is little or no rain, and the people are dependent on the annual overflowing of the Nile for the proper irrigation of their fields; and as this lasts only for a short period, the water has to be stored and redistributed by artificial means, often of a very laborious kind. Wateredst it with thy foot. "The reference, perhaps, is to the manner of conducting the water about from plant to plant and from furrow to furrow. I have often watched the gardener at this fatiguing and unhealthy work. When one place is sufficiently saturated, he pushes aside the sandy soil between it and the next furrow with his foot, and thus continues to do until all are watered. He is thus knee-deep in mud, and many are the diseases generated by this slavish work. Or the reference may be to certain kinds of hydraulic machines which were turned by the feet. I have seen small water-wheels, on the plain of Acre and elsewhere, which were thus worked; and it appeared to me to be very tedious and toilsome, and, if the whole country had to be irrigated by such a process, it would require a nation of slaves like the Hebrews, and taskmasters like the Egyptians, to make it succeed. Whatever may have been the meaning of Moses, the Hebrews no doubt had learned by bitter experience what it was <span class="accented">to water with the foot</span>; and this would add great force to the allusion, and render doubly precious the goodly land which drank of the rain of heaven, and required no such drudgery to make it fruitful" (Thomson, ' The Land and the Book,' 2:279; edit. Lend. 1859). Philo describes a machine cf. this sort as in use in Egypt ('De Confus. Linguar.,' Opp. 1:410, edit. Mangey); and in that country, "a garden of herbs" is still generally watered by means of a machine of simple construction, consisting of a wheel, round which revolves an endless rope to which buckets are attached; this is worked by the feet of a man seated on a piece of wood fastened by the side of the machine, labor at once monotonous and severe (Niebuhr, 'Voyage en Arabic,' 1:121, 4to, Amst. 1776; 'Description de l'Arabic,' 1:219, 4to, Paris, 1779; Robinson, 'Bib. lies.,' 1:542; 2:21).

The two mountains named stand opposite to each other, with a valley between, about two hundred yards broad at the widest part, in which stood the town of Shechem, now Nablus. They were selected for the purpose mentioned, doubtless, because of their relative position, and probably also because they stand in the center of the land both from north to south, and from east to west. It has been suggested that Ebal was appointed for the uttering of the curse, and Gerizim for the uttering of the blessing, because the former was barren and rugged, the latter fertile and smooth; but this is not borne out by the actual appearance of the two bills, both being equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation. That Gerizim was selected for the blessing because of its position on the south side of the valley "towards the region of light," while Ebal was appointed for the curse because it was on the north side, can be regarded only as an ingenious fancy.

The heathen had their places of worship on lofty elevations, probably because they imagined they were thus nearer to the object of their worship; and they sought also the shade of woods or thick-foliaged trees (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>), under which to perform their rites, as tending to inspire awe, and as in keeping with the mysterious character of their rites.

As the revealed God - the God whose being and perfections had been made known, not by a vague revelation of him in nature merely, but expressly by his putting or recording his Name historically and locally among men (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>) - so should there be a definite place chosen and appointed by him where he would come to receive the worship of his people, where he would record his Name, and where he would be known for a Refuge and a Helper to all who put their trust in him (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76-1.htm">Psalm 76:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>). The Name of God is God himself as revealed; and he puts his Name on any place where he specially manifests himself as present  (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>), and which is consequently to be regarded as his habitation or dwelling-place. Hence the temple at Jerusalem was in later times known as the place of the Name of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), the dwelling-place of his glory (<a href="../../par/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>). But he is the God of the whole earth, and therefore, wherever he is pleased to reveal himself, in whatever place he makes his Name to be known, there he is to be worshipped. There is no reference in this passage to the temple at Jerusalem specially, as some have supposed; what is here enjoined is only a practical application of the Divine promise, that in <span class="accented">all</span> places where God would record his Name, there he would come to bless his people (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The reference here, therefore, is quite general, and applies to any place where, by the Divine appointment, the tabernacle might be set up and the worship of Jehovah instituted. <span class="cmt_word">Unto his habitation shall ye seek.</span> To seek to any place means, primarily, to resort to it, to frequent it (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-5.htm">2 Chronicles 1:5</a>), but with the implied purpose of inquiring there for something, as for responses or oracles, when the place resorted to was that in which God had put his Name.

There it seems as if the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the flesh was to be given to the priest. "And the flesh of them shall be thine [the priest's], as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine." This may be taken to mean that just as the wave breast and the right shoulder are the perquisites of the priests in the case of other offerings, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the peace offering, so in the case of the firstling offering the whole flesh shall be the priest's; and thus taken, the passage presents an unquestionable discrepancy to that in Deuteronomy. But probably the passage is not to be so taken. The particle translated "as" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>.) not infrequently occurs in the sense of "according to, after the manner of," implying conformity to some rule or model (<a href="../../par/genesis/44-2.htm">Genesis 44:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-4.htm">Numbers 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-3.htm">Numbers 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-18.htm">Numbers 29:18</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Zechariah 2:10 [Zechariah 2:6], etc.). The passage, therefore, may be rendered thus: <span class="accented">And the flesh of them shalt thou take after the manner</span> (<span class="accented">or according to the rule</span>), of the wave breast, etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the whole of it, but only these parts. So the LXX. seem to have taken the passage: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Of some of the offerings the whole was received by the priest, as in the case of the sin offering and trespass offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, etc.; Leviticus 7:1, etc.); while of others only certain portions, viz. the wave breast and the heave shoulder, were given to him, as in the case of the peace offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-28.htm">Leviticus 7:28</a>, etc.). The purport of the law in <a href="../../par/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a> is that, in respect of the firstling offering, the allotment to the priest shall be after the same manner as in the peace offering. There is thus no discrepancy between the two passages. The animal belonged originally to the offerer; when he brought it before the Lord part of it was consumed on the altar, part of it was assigned to the priest, and the rest, as a matter of course, remained with himself. The law in Numbers, addressed to the priest, intimates what he might claim as his portion; the law in Deuteronomy, where the people are addressed, directs them how to use the portion that remained with them. It may be added that, even supposing that all the flesh was given to the priest, yet, as it had to be consumed on the day in which the sacrifice was offered, and as every clean person in the house might partake of it, it is almost certain that the offerer would, as a matter of course, share in the meal, as was usual in the case of sacrificial meals. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto</span>; enjoy whatever your hand may gain, whatever you may earn, all the good which the Lord may give you (cf. ver. 18; 15:10; 23. 20; 28:8, 20).

Hence, perhaps, they are described as "within the gates" of the rest of the people. Or, as the Levites seem to have itinerated in the discharge of various offices among the people, the phrase may designate them as on this account occasionally resident among others in their community; just as "the stranger that is within thy gates" means the person of some other nation who for the time being was resident in any of the towns of Israel.

By this word the Hebrews designated the animal life-principle in men and in beasts; and as without this the body was a mere inert mass, the word came to be used for "life" generally. Of this life the blood was believed to be the seat, and was regarded as the symbol, so that to shed blood was tantamount to the taking away of life. As the blood, moreover, was the life, in it was supposed to lie the propitiatory power - the power, when shed, of atoning for sin, as the giving of life for life. The prohibition of eating it doubtless had respect to this. It was not merely to prevent ferocity in men towards the lower animals (as Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests) that the eating of blood was interdicted, but specially because there was in this a sort of profanation, a putting to a common use of what appertained to a sacred rite.

The law, as here laid down, is the same as that in <a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>, somewhat expanded; the most important addition being that the slave is not only to go free after six years of service, but is to be furnished by his master with the means of setting up a home for himself. The six years here specified are not to be confounded with the years ending at the sabbatical year; they are any six years during which the individual has been in bondage.

This was not a painful operation, especially as the servant's ear was probably already pierced for a ring; nor does any infamy appear to have been attached to the bearing of this badge of perpetual servitude. There is no mention here, as in Exodus, of the matter being referred to the judges; and this has led some to suppose that, by the time this later prescription was given, the earlier usage had passed away; but it is more natural to suppose that this usage was so regular and well known that it was needless formally to announce it.

It is not intended by this that an appeal was to lie from the lower court to the higher, or that the parties in a suit might carry it at once to the supreme judge; the meaning rather is that, when the ordinary judges found a case too difficult for them to deal with, they were themselves to transmit it to the supreme court for decision.

In case, then, of their coming to desire to have a king over them like the nations around them, Moses gives instructions here as to the choice of a king, and as to the duties and obligations resting upon those who might be elevated to that office. The form in which these are conveyed clearly indicates that, at the time this was uttered, the existence of a king in Israel was contemplated as only a distant possibility. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou art come unto the land</span>, etc. This phraseology, which is common to the laws which respect the affairs of the Hebrews after they should be settled in Canaan, implies that this law was given whilst they were yet outside the Promised Land. It is plain also, from the tenor of the whole statement in this verse, that the legislator in this case is providing for what he supposes may happen, is likely to happen, but which he by no means desires should happen. Moses foresaw that the people would wish to be as the nations around them - governed by a king - and he legislates accordingly, without approving of that wish.

In what way this was to be exercised, and how it was subject to the Divine choice, is not declared. Judging from what actually happened in subsequent history, it would appear that only on special occasions, such as the election of the first king or a change of dynasty, did God take the initiative, and through a prophet direct the choice of the people; ultimately the monarchy became hereditary, and it was understood that the prince who succeeded to the throne did so with the Divine approval, unless the opposite was expressly intimated by a message from God.

It is forbidden to him to multiply horses, to multiply wives, and to amass large treasures of silver and gold, and he must have a copy of the Law written out for him from that kept by the priests, that he might have it by him, and read it all the days of his life. The multiplying of horses is prohibited, because this would bring Israel into intercourse and friendly relations with Egypt, and might tend to their going back to that country from which they had been so marvelously delivered; a prohibition which could only have been given at an early stage in the history of the people, for at a later period, after they had been well established in Canaan, such a prohibition for such a reason would have been simply ridiculous. The prohibition to multiply wives and to amass large treasures has respect to the usage common from the earliest period with Oriental monarchs to have vast harems and huge accumulations of the precious metals, as much for ostentation as for either luxury or use; and as there was no small danger of the King of Israel being seduced to follow this usage, and so to have his heart turned away from the Lord, it was fitting that such a prohibition should be prospectively enacted for his guidance. Both these prohibitions were neglected by Solomon, and probably by others of the Jewish kings; but this only indicates that the law was so ancient that it had come in their time to be regarded as obsolete. The rule that the king was to write him a copy of the Law for his own constant use does not necessarily imply that he was to write this with his own hand; he might cause it to be written by some qualified scribe for him.

According to Josephus ('Antiq ,' 4:4, 4), Philo ('De Praemiis. Sacerdot.,' p. 832, Opp., tom. 2. p. 235, edit. Maugey), the Talmud, etc., this injunction relates to the slaying of animals at home for private use, and not such as were killed for sacrifice.

How could people, residing at a distance, convey to the priests the portions due to them every time they slaughtered an animal for domestic use? At the same time, the sacrifices here referred to do not seem to be included in the offerings by fire above mentioned; and these gifts to the priest seem to have been something over and above his ordinary dues. There is probability, therefore, in the suggestion that "the reference is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats, which were not intended for <span class="accented">shelamim</span> in the more limited sense, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for one of the three species of peace offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 16</a>), but for festal meals in the broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals prepared from the <span class="accented">shelamim"</span> (Keil).

It is sometimes said that the verb of which this word is a part (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, a serpent; whence it is inferred that the species of divination indicated by this word is <span class="accented">ophiomancy</span>, or divination by serpents, but this is not generally accepted by scholars. <span class="cmt_word">A witch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">maleficus</span>); probably one who pretended to cure diseases, or procure some desired result, by means of nostrums and philtres. In the enumeration of the wise men of Babylon (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), the Mecashephim have a place beside the Hartummim, and in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a> and <a href="../../par/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, they are joined with the Hachamim or Magi of Egypt; and this favors the conclusion that their sorcery had a quasi-scientific basis. The English word "witch" is now restricted to the <span class="accented">female</span> practicer of unlawful arts; formerly it was applied to <span class="accented">males</span> as well, if not chiefly (Trench, 'Select Glossary,' p. 806). <span class="cmt_word">A charmer</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>); a dealer in spells, one who by means of spells or charms pretends to achieve some desired result. The verb here used primarily means to bind, and the species of magic indicated is probably that practiced by binding certain knots, whereby it was supposed that the curse or blessing, as the case might he, was bound on its object; this was accompanied apparently with incantation (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>). Comp. English <span class="accented">spell-bound</span>, and the phrase, "to rivet charms" (Jonson, 'Sad Shepherd,' 2:2). A species of incantation known to the Romans consisted in tying knots with threads of different colors, three in number, which were supposed to become a bond to secure an object (cf. Virg., 'Eclog.' 8:76, 77). <span class="cmt_word">A consulter with familiar spirits.</span> This phrase conveys something different from what is expressed, in the Hebrew. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> is one who asks or inquires of an Ob, that is, a Python, or divining spirit. This spirit was supposed to be in the person of the conjurer, and to be able to reveal to him what was secret or hidden in the future (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>). The notion of "a familiar spirit," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a spirit not dwelling in the person, but with which he is intimate - generally the spirit of one who formerly lived on earth - is a modern notion not known to Scripture. The persons here referred to were probably ventriloquists (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and used their faculty in this respect for purposes of magic, pretending that they had within them a spirit which they could consult, and by which they could predict what would happen or reveal what was hid. <span class="cmt_word">Wizard</span>. The English word "wizard" did not originally convey the idea of anything evil in the person of whom it was used; Milton applies it to the Magi who came to worship at Bethlehem ('Ode on the Nativity,' 4.); it meant merely "the wise one," or "the knowing one;" and thus is an exact equivalent for the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, knowing, wise, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to know). <span class="cmt_word">A necromancer</span>; one who professed to call up the dead, and from them to learn the secrets of futurity (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>).

(<span class="accented">As</span> illustrative of the meaning of the word, cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>.) Hence Abraham is called a prophet (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>), and the term is applied to the patriarchs generally (<span class="accented">Psalm</span> 105:15); God conveyed his mind to them, and they spoke it forth to others (cf. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 3:7). <span class="cmt_word">Like unto me.</span> When the people heard the voice of God speaking to them at Sinai, and from the midst of the fire uttering to them the Ten Words, they were struck with terror, and besought that they might not again hear that awful voice, but that Moses might act as mediator between God and them - might hear what God should <span class="accented">say</span>, and speak it unto them (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-27</a>). Moses thus became God's prophet to the people; and of this he reminds them here, as well as of the circumstances amid which he entered specially on this office (cf. vers. 16, 17). The phrase, "<span class="accented">like</span> unto <span class="accented">me</span>," does not necessarily imply  that the prophet who was to come after Moses was to be in every respect the same as he; all that is indicated is that he would act as Moses had acted as a mediator between God and the people in the way of conveying his will to them.

The question has been raised whether, by the Prophet like unto Moses, here promised to the people of Israel, is to be understood some eminent individual, or whether this refers to the prophetic <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, or succession, that was to continue under the theocracy. For the latter the context strongly speaks, for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the contrast between what God here forbids the Israelites to do, viz. to resort to diviners and soothsayers, and the provision he would make for them so as to render this needless, point to a succession of prophets rather than to one individual; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the reference in what follows to the discrimination of false prophets from true prophets, shows that a multiplicity and a succession of prophets was in the view of the speaker, not a single individual; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as a succession of priests, of judges, and of kings was contemplated in this part of the Mosaic legislation, the presumption is that a succession also of prophets was contemplated. At the same time, the use of the singular here is remarkable, for nowhere else is the singular, <span class="accented">nabhi</span>, employed to designate more than one individual; and this <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the reference here may be to some individual in whom not only was the succession to culminate as in its crown and eminence, but whose spirit was to pervade the whole succession, - that each member of it should exercise his functions only as that Spirit which was in them did signify (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>). It is possible also, as Oryon Gerlach has suggested, that "Prophet" here may be used as "<span class="accented">seed"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, and that this is a prediction of Christ as the True Prophet, just as the assurance to Eve was a prediction of the Messiah, who, as the Head and Crown of the" godly seed," should end the conflict with the serpent and his seed by a crushing victory. It is to be considered also that, whilst the words "like unto me" do not necessarily imply a resemblance in <span class="accented">all</span> respects between Moses and the Prophet here promised, and whilst they may be well applied to One superior in many respects to Moses, it would be taking them at much below their real worth were we to understand them of one greatly inferior to Moses, as all the prophets who succeeded him in Israel were until the Chief came (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). Finally, there can be no doubt that the Jews expected that the Messiah would appear as the Prophet by pre-eminence, and that they founded that expectation on the promise here recorded (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-37.htm">Acts 7:37</a>). It may be added that our Lord seems to apply this to himself, when he says to the Jews, "There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me" (<a href="../../par/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45, 46</a>; cf. also John 11:48-50). How early and how widespread was the expectation that the Messiah would come as a prophet, may be inferred from the existence of this among the Samaritans (<a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It is to be concluded, then, that this promise has reference ultimately to the Messiah, the Great Revealer of God, between whom and Moses there should be a long succession of prophets, so that there should always be a medium of Divine communication between Jehovah and his people.

But it seems more natural to refer it to what follows - to the addresses in this book. The pronoun these (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) may be used with a prospective reference, as well as with a retrospective (cf. e.g. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). The author does not by this connect this book with the preceding, but rather distinguishes it. The subscription to Numbers (<a href="../../par/numbers/36-13.htm">Numbers 36:13</a>) indicates that what precedes is occupied chiefly with what God spake to Moses; the inscription here intimates that what follows is what Moses spake to the people. This is the characteristic of Deuteronomy. <span class="cmt_word">Unto all Israel.</span> It cannot be supposed that Moses spoke to the whole multitude of the people so as to be heard by them. Hence the Jewish interpreters say that he spoke to the elders of the people, who carried his words to the people at large. This is just; for what was thus mediately communicated to the people might be fairly described as spoken to them; and we find from other passages in the Pentateuch that the phrase, "the elders of Israel," in the mind of the writer, was equivalent to "the congregation of Israel" (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a> with ver. 21; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a> with ver. 5). But through whatever medium conveyed, it was to the people that these words were addressed; this is emphatically a book for the people. <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan.</span> This should be <span class="accented">On the other side</span> or <span class="accented">beyond Jordan</span>, and so also in ver. 5, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20, 25</a>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) means properly something beyond, over, or across, and indicates that which, to the speaker, lies on the <span class="accented">other</span> side of some line or limit. When coupled with "the Jordan," it usually indicates the region to the <span class="accented">east</span> of that river; only in one or two instances, where the speaker takes his standpoint on the east of the river, does it designate the regions to the west of Jordan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>) The phrase "beyond Jordan" seems to have been the established designation of the region east of the Jordan (cf. <a href="../../par/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a>, and Canon Rawlinson's note there). It is this, unquestionably, which is here so designated, as what follows expressly shows. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness.</span> This term is used of any extensive district not occupied by inhabitants or subjected to culture; hence of vast prairies or pasturelands, as well as of places properly desert and desolate. It here denotes the grassy plains or downs on the east and southeast of the Jordan, in the land of Moab (ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>; in the Arabah. This is properly the whole of that remarkable depression which stretches from the source  of the Jordan on to Akabah, or the Ailanitic Gulf; but here it is only that part of it which extends from the south end of the Dead Sea to Allah (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>). This part still bears the name of the 'Arabah, the northern part being known as the Ghor (Smith's 'Dictionary,' vol. 1. p. 87; Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' vol. 1. p. 178). <span class="cmt_word">Over against the Red sea.</span> The name by which the Red Sea is elsewhere designated is <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>); here only the latter word occurs, and this has led some to doubt if the Red Sea be here intended. Patrick, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others suggest that <span class="accented">Suph</span> denotes some place in that region, probably Suphah (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>, margin, Authorized Version), <span class="accented">so</span> called because lying at its extremity, as the verb <span class="accented">suph</span>, from which it comes, means, to come to an end; but it is not certain that Suphah designates a place in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;</span> means a tempest or whirlwind; and this meaning may be assumed here, as it is by Gesenius, Keil, and others: "Waheb [he conquered] in a storm." Knobel suggests that probably the pass now called Es Sufah, on the north side of the Wady Murreh - the Maleh-acrabbim (Scorpion-ascent) of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> - is meant; others have suggested Zephath (<a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), and others Zuph (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>). It is probable, however, that <span class="accented">Suph</span> is here merely a breviloquence for <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span>, the Red Sea; and so all the ancient versions take it. The identification of the <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span> of the Old Testament with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> of the Greeks, the <span class="accented">mare erythraeum</span>, or <span class="accented">rubrum</span>, of the Latins, is due to the LXX., which other versions have followed. The identification is undoubtedly correct (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/33-10.htm">Numbers 33:10</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span>, indeed, means simply sea of weeds, and might be the name of any sea in which algae are found; but these passages clearly prove that by this the Hebrews designated the Red Sea. At what part of this sea the Israelites crossed, and the hosts of Pharaoh were submerged, is and must remain uncertain, because we know not what was the condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus. It is probable it was not at any part of what is now known as the Red Sea or Gulf of Suez. Brugsch Bey places it at that - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Serbonian bog<br />Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,<br />Where armies whole have sunk."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Milton, 'Paradise Lost,'Bk. 2:592.</span>) But this has not been accepted by scholars generally (see <span class="accented">Edinburgh Review</span>, No. 307; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 247; <span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, July and October, 1880). It seems probable that originally only a marshy district lay between the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean; and somewhere in this probably the passage of the Israelites and the drowning of the Egyptians occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Between Paran, and Tophel</span>, etc. This serves more fully and particularly to indicate the locality here intended; but the details present considerable difficulty. Taken in connection with the words "over against the lied <span class="accented">sea</span>," the names here given can only be regarded as intended more precisely to indicate the region in which the Israelites had been during the forty years of their wandering. <span class="accented">Paran</span>: this is the name of the wilderness bordering on Idumea, where the Israelites encamped (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>); the place of their encampment being Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21, 26</a>), which was the eastern part of the wilderness of Paran. <span class="accented">hod</span>. Wady Murreh. The wilderness of Paran corresponds in general outline with the desert of Et-Tih. This is a vast plateau of irregular surface stretching from the Et-Tih range northwards to the boundaries of the Holy Land, and from the Gulf of Akabah and the Wady cf. Arabah on the east to the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean on the west. It is described as "a chalky formation, the chalk being covered with coarse gravel, mixed with black flints and drifting sand;" not, however, wholly sterile: in many parts vegetation abounds, considerable portions are under cultivation, and there are evidences that it one time water was abundant there (Smith, 2:767; Kitto, 3:1077; Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 80). It is not, however, to the wilderness of Paran that the reference is in the text, but to some definite locality or spot in the region in which the Israelites then were, or which they had recently passed through. It has been suggested that the place now called Feiran, and where there are the ruins of a town, once of some importance in the early history of Christianity, is the Paran of this passage, as it apparently is the Paran of <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>. But this locality at the base of Jebel Serbail is much too far west to be the Paran here referred to. More probable is the suggestion that it is the Faran mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome ('Onomast.,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>), a city to the cast (northeast) of Allah or Elath, about three days' journey (Reland, 'Palest.,' p. 556; Winer, 'Realworterbuch,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. Pharan). <span class="accented">Tophel</span>: this name occurs only here; it is supposed to be the place now coiled Tufailah or Tafyleh, a large village of six hundred inhabitants, between Bozrah and Kerak, on the eastern slope of the mountains of Edom (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 402; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 2:570). As this is a place where the Syrian caravans are supplied with  provisions, it has been conjectured that the Israelites, when at Oboth (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10, 11</a>), may have resorted to it for a supply, and that it was here that they purchased meat and drink from the children of Esau (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Laban.</span> <span class="accented">Laban</span> is generally identified with Libnah, the second place of encampment of the Israelites on their return from Kadesh (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-20.htm">Numbers 33:20, 21</a>). Knobel, however, thinks it is the place called by Ptolemy '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, lying between Petra and Allah; this name, from the Arabic  (he was white), having the same meaning as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Hazeroth</span> is supposed to be the place mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, from which the Israelites entered the wilderness of Paran; but as the other places here mentioned are on the east side of the Arabah, it is not probable that this Hazeroth is the same as that of Numbers, which must have been not far from Sinai, in a northerly or north-westerly direction from that mountain, probably at or near to the fountain now called El Hudherah (Wilson, 'Lands of the Bible,' 1:235; Kitto, 'Cyclopedia,' 2:243). There were probably several places bearing the name of <span class="accented">Hazeroth</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. villages. <span class="cmt_word">Dizahab</span>. This is generally identified with Dhahab, a place on a tongue of land in the Gulf of Akabah. But it is extremely improbable that the Israelites ever were at this place, the approach to which is exceedingly difficult; and the mere resemblance of the names Dizahab and Dhahab is not sufficient to prove the identity of the places. There were probably more places than one which were named from <span class="accented">zahab</span> (gold) in the region traversed by the Israelites. There is a Dhahab on the east of the Jordan near the Zerka or Jabbok, a double mound, which is said to derive its name from the yellowish color of the sandstone rock of which it consists, and which is metalliferous. In the Arabic of the Polyglot, Dizahab appears as <span class="accented">Dhi-dhahab</span>, which signifies "<span class="accented">auro</span> <span class="accented">praeditum</span> vel <span class="accented">ab auro dictum</span>; <span class="accented">nam</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> vel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span>, apud Arabes in compositione nominum propr. idem est ac Hebrews <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> (J. H. Michaelis). There is a various reading here, <span class="accented">Di-waheb</span>, and this has been supposed to connect this place with the Waheb of <a href="../../par/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. But, as above noted, it is by no means certain that Waheb is there the name of a place; it may, as Bishop Patrick suggests, be that of a man, some hero or chief, who was conquered in Sufah or in a storm. Waheb is a name among the Arabs. The maternal grandfather of Me-hammed had this name (Abul-Pharaj, 'Hist. Dynast.,' p. 161, edit. Pococke, Oxen., 1663); and the sect of the Wahabees take their name from Abdul Wahab, a fanatic who appeared about the beginning of last century. The words "between Paran and Tophel" have been taken to indicate' the termini of the wanderings; at the commencement of these the people were at Paran, and towards the close of them they were at Tophel. '"Looking from the steppes of Moab over the ground that the Israelites had traversed, Suph, where they first entered the desert of Arabia, would lie between Paran where the congregation arrived at the borders of Canaan toward the west, and Tophel where they first ended their desert wanderings thirty-seven years later on the east" (Keil). But this assumes that Paran here is the wilderness of Paran.

The mountain range here referred to seems to have been, not that on the east of the 'Arabah, but what is in vers. 6 and 19 called "the mountain of the Amorites," "the Seir by Hormah" of ver. 44, i e. the southern part of what was afterwards called the mountains of Judah. According to ver. 19, the Israelites, when they left Horeb, passed through the wilderness along the way that led to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-barnea. Kadesh must, therefore, be looked for, not on the eastern side of the 'Arabah, but somewhere in the wilderness of Zin. It has been identified with the place now known as 'Ain Kudes, near the northern extremity of Jebel Halal, and to the east of that hill; but this is far from being certain. Moses reminds the Israelites that the distance between Horeb and Kadesh is eleven days - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, about one hundred and sixty-five miles, the day's journey being reckoned at fifteen miles - not to give them a piece of information, but rather to suggest to them how, in consequence of rebellion, a journey which might have been so easily accomplished, had been protracted through many wearisome years.

It was also after the destruction of Sihon and 'Og (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). This also is significant. By the destruction of these kings, who sought to bar the access of the Israelites to the Promised Land, God had given proof that he would indeed fulfill his promise to his people, and had at once laid them under obligations to obedience, and given them encouragement to go forward on the course to which he had called them.

What Moses set himself to do, then, was not to publish a new law, but to make plain to the people the Law already promulgated, to set forth clearly and pointedly what they were required by the Law to be and to do. This explains more fully the "spake" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of ver. 3. This exposition of the Law was designed specially for the sake of those who, at the time the Law was first promulgated, either were not born or were incapable of understanding it (Grotius). The expression used by Moses plainly indicates that this book was not intended to furnish a second code of laws different from the former, but simply to explain and enforce what had before been enjoined.

It is of an introductory character, and is occupied chiefly with a retrospective survey of the events that had occurred during the forty years of their wanderings. By this Moses reminded the people how God had fulfilled his promises to them, and at the same time, how they had by their rebellion drawn down on them his displeasure, which had caused their wanderings to be so much more protracted than they would otherwise have been. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - The Lord's command to depart from Horeb, and his promise to the people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord our God</span> <span class="accented">- Jehovah our God</span>.

There he made himself known to them as Jehovah, the Eternal and Unchangeable, and entered into covenant with them; and there they received that Law, on the keeping of which depended their retention of the privileges to which they had been elected. At Horeb the Israelites had remained for about a year (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>. I and <a href="../../par/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11, 12</a>), and as the purpose for which they had been brought thither was answered, they were enjoined to move, not indeed by express command, but by the rising of the cloud from over the tabernacle, which was the signal of their march (<a href="../../par/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.; Numbers 10:11-13), preceded by the instructions they had received preparatory to their removal (Numbers 50:4-7). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.</span> The Israelites remained at Sinai from the third month of the first year to the twentieth day of the second year after they came  out of Egypt (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>).

The mountain range of the Amorites, afterwards called the hill country of Judah and Ephraim, was the object which would first strike the view of one advancing from the south; and so, it stands here for the whole land of Canaan, with which it is in this context identified. Those "that dwell thereon" are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan. The Amorites (Hebrew <span class="accented">Emori</span>, so called from Amor, or Emor) oftener than once appear as standing for the Canaanites generally (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20, 21</a>, etc.). That all the inhabitants of Canaan are intended here is evident from the specification of the different districts of the land of Canaan which immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>: the '<span class="accented">Arabah</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">In the hills</span>: the hill country of Judah (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>: the <span class="accented">shephelah</span>, or lowland, the country lying between the mountain range of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching northwards from the parallel of Gaza to that of Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">In the south</span>: the <span class="accented">negeb</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> southland (literally, <span class="accented">dryness</span>), the district which formed the transition from the desert to the cultivated land, extending from the south of the Dead Sea westwards to Gaza, a vast steppe or prairie, for the most part pasture land. The seashore: the narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean from <span class="accented">Joppa to</span> Tyre (in the New Testament, "the coast of Tyre and Sidon," <a href="../../par/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Canaanites</span>: the whole country of which these were the separate parts. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Lebanon</span>: the <span class="accented">Whale Mountain</span>, so called, probably, from the snow which rests on its summit. <span class="cmt_word">The great river, the river Euphrates</span>. The Phrath, or Euphrates, which has its sources in the mountains of Armenia, and in its course divides Armenia from Cappadocia, formed the eastern limit of the territory promised by God to Abraham.

The mention of Lebanon and the Euphrates is not, as Keil <span class="accented">suggests</span>, "to be attributed to the rhetorical fullness of the style;" but is due to the fact that these were included in what God promised to Abraham and his seed (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>).

The Lord had placed this land in the power of the Israelites, had given it up to them to possess and use it, according as he had sworn to their fathers, the patriarchs, to give it to them and their seed (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc.; Genesis 22:16). At Horeb, therefore, they received the charter of their inheritance, and might have gone on at once to take possession of the land. The delay that had occurred had arisen solely from their own waywardness and perversity, not from anything on the part of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-18.</span> - Moses reminds them that he had done all that was required on his part to conduct the people to the enjoyment of what God had freely given to them. The people had so increased in number that Moses found himself unable to attend to all the matters that concerned them, or to adjudicate in all the differences that arose among them. God had brought to pass that which he had promised to Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; in this Moses rejoiced, nay, he would even that their numbers were, with the Divine blessing, increased a thousandfold beyond what they were. But he found the burden, the weight of care and trouble, especially in connection with their strifes and suits thereby brought on him, too much for him; and, therefore, whilst they were still at Horeb, he had, following the advice of Jethro, his father-in-law, counseled them to select competent men from among themselves, who should relieve him by attending to those duties which he found it too burdensome for him to have to attend to (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>, etc.). This appointment of captains was quite distinct from that of the elders whom God directed Moses to select that they might assist him in bearing the burden of the people (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a>, etc.). The occasion of the appointment was the same in both cases, viz. the complaint of Moses that the task was too onerous for him, but the time, the place, and the manner of the two transactions were different. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I spake unto you at that time.</span> The somewhat indefinite phrase, "at that time" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>), does not refer to the time <span class="accented">after</span> the people departed from Horeb, but to the time generally when they were in that region (see <a href="../../par/exodus/18-5.htm">Exodus 18:5, 13</a>). "The imperfect (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, I spake), with <span class="accented">yaw</span> tel. expresses the order of thought and not of time" (Keil). It is not mentioned in Exodus that Moses spake to the people, as here stated, but what Jethro said to him to this effect is recorded; and as Moses proceeded to put in execution what his lather-in-law advised, it is probable that in doing so he told the people what he proposed to do, with his reasons for so doing, and obtained their assent, as here mentioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye <i>are</i> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Notwithstanding the cruel oppression to which they were subjected in Egypt, the Israelites had so increased in numbers that they went out of the house of their bondage a mighty host. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). God had promised to Abraham that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; and Moses here reminds the people that this promise had been fulfilled. This is hardly to be regarded as the utterance of hyperbole. When God gave the premise to Abraham it was to the stars as <span class="accented">seen by the patriarch</span>, not as actually existing in the immensity of space, that reference was made; and as the number of stars which can be taken in with the naked eye does not exceed 3000, and as Israel at this time numbered more than 600,000, counting only the adult males (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-32.htm">Numbers 2:32</a>), - it might be literally said of them that they had been multiplied as the stars of heaven. The comparison, however, imported nothing more than that their numbers were very great.

Some understand all these three, of troubles and burdens laid upon Moses, by his being called upon to compose differences, and adjust competing claims among the people. But other burdens besides these came upon him as the leader of the nation; and it seems best, therefore, to understand the first two of troubles and burdens generally.

In the northern part especially the country is rugged and bare, with vast tracts of sand, over which the scorching simoom often sweeps (see on ver. 1). This wilderness they had seen, had known, and had experience of, and their experience had been such that the district through which they had been doomed to wander appeared to them dreadful. Passing by the way of the Amorites, as they had been commanded (ver. 7), they came to Kadesh-barnea (see <a href="../../par/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>). Their discontent broke out oftener than once, before they reached this place (see <a href="../../par/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11, 12</a>.); but Moses, in this recapitulation, passes over these earlier instances of their rebelliousness, and hastens to remind them of the rebellion at Kadesh (<a href="../../par/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13, 14</a>.), because it was this which led to the nation being doomed to wander in the wilderness until the generation that came out of Egypt had died. It was through faith in God that Canaan was to be gained and occupied by Israel; but this faith they lacked, and so they came short of what God had summoned them t, attain (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-24.htm">Psalm 106:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18, 19</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>). Hence, when they had come to the very borders of the Promised Land, and the hills of Canaan were before their eyes, and Moses said to them, in the name of God, <span class="cmt_word">Go up,</span> <span class="cmt_word">possess</span> ("asyndeton emphaticum," Mi-chaelis), they hung back, and proposed that men should be sent out to survey the land and bring a report concerning it. This was approved of by Moses; but when the spies returned and gave their report, the people were discouraged, and refused to go up. They were thus <span class="cmt_word">rebellious against the commandment</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the mouth</span>, the express will) of Jehovah their God; and not only so, but with signal ingratitude and impiety they murmured against him, and attributed their deliverance out of Egypt to God's hatred of them, that he might <span class="accented">destroy</span> them (see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-33</a>, to which the narrative here corresponds).

If the latter rendering be adopted, the meaning will be, Notwithstanding what I then said to you, ye remained unbelieving, etc. This latter seems the more probable meaning. In the Hebrew text there is a strong stop (<span class="accented">athnach</span>) after <span class="accented">this word</span>, as if a pause of astonishment followed this utterance - Notwithstanding this word, strange to say! ye were not believing, etc. The participle ("believing") is intended to indicate the <span class="accented">continuing</span> of this unbelief. So also in ver. 34, the participle form is used - "who was going in the way before you," to indicate that not once and again, but continually, the Lord went before them; and this made the sin of their unbelief all the more marked and aggravated. (For the fact here referred to, see <a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.; Numbers 10:33-36.)

This parenthetical reference to himself was probably thrown in by Moses for the purpose of preparing for what he was about to say respecting Joshua, in whom the people were to find a leader after he himself was gone. It may be noted also that Moses distinguishes between the anger of the Lord against him, and the wrath which broke forth upon the people - a distinction which is aptly preserved in the Authorized Version by the words "was wroth" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>) and "was angry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of you</span>, <span class="accented">on accent of</span> you.

The former has reference to their having to wrest the land by force from the Canaanites (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to occupy by force, to dispossess; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12, 21, 22</a>, where the verb is, in the Authorized Version, rendered by "destroy"); the latter has reference to their receiving the land as a heritage (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5df;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;</span>) from God, who, when he divided to the nations their inheritance, assigned Canaan to the children of Israel (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>).

Thus, when Laban and Bethuel said to Abraham's servant "We cannot speak unto thee bad or good" (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>), the meaning is, We can say nothing at all. Absalom spake to Amnon "neither good nor bad" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a>); that is, he did not say anything to him.

These tribes came down from the higher mountain range to the lower height which the Israelites had gained, and drove them with great slaughter as far as Hormah, in Seir, chasing them as bees do, which pursue with keen ferocity those who disturb them. Hormah (Ban-place), the earlier name of which was Zephath (<a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>), was a royal city of the Canaanites, taken by the Israelites towards the close of their wanderings, and placed by them under a ban (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>, etc.), which ban was fully executed only in the time of the Judges. It is here and elsewhere called Hormah by anticipation. The old name Zephath seems to have survived that given to it by the Israelites in the name Sebaita or Sepata, the Arabic form of Zephath, the name of a heap of ruins on the western slope of the rocky mountain-plateau Rakhmah, about two hours and a half south-west of Khalasa (Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:431; Palmer, 'Desert of Et-Tih,' p. 289, etc.). This is a more probable identification than that of Robinson ('Res.,' 2:18), who finds Hormah in the rocky defile of Es-Sufah, an unlikely place for a city of the importance of Zephath to be in.

But as the words stand in the text, they can only be rendered thus: "For the man s a tree of the field." This gives no good sense, or indeed, any sense at all; and hence it is proposed to alter the reading of the text so as to produce a meaning that shall be acceptable. From an early period the expedient has been resorted to of reading the clause interrogatively, and, instead of regarding it as parenthetical, connecting it with the following words, thus: "Is the tree of the field a man to come into siege before thee?" So the LXX., Rashi, etc. It has been thought that only a very slight change in the punctuation is required to justify this rendering (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>); but more than this is acquired: the subject and object are hereby reversed, and this is more than can be allowed. From an early period also it has been proposed to read the clause as a negation, "For the tree of the field is not a man to come into siege before thee." So the Targum of Onkelos, Abarbanel, Vulgate, etc. The sense here is substantially the same as in the preceding, and the same general objection applies to both. To both also it may be objected that by this way of taking the passage Moses is made to utter a sentiment at once puerile and irrelevant; for what need to declare formally, or in effect, that a tree is not a man? and what reason is there in this for not cutting down fruit trees any more than other trees? In the margin of the Authorized Version an alternative rendering is proposed, "O man, the tree of the field is to be employed in the siege." But admitting this as a possible rendering, it is exposed to the objection, on the one hand, that it is improbable that in a prosaic address like this an explanatory appeal would be introduced; and on the other, that it is inconceivable that Moses would in this casual and startling way anticipate what he goes on in the next sentence to express deliberately and clearly. The passage has probably suffered at the hands of a transcriber, and the text as we have it is corrupt. The sense put upon it in the Authorized Version is that suggested by Ibn Ezra, and in the absence of anything better this may be accepted. The fruit tree is man's life, as it furnishes that by which life is sustained, just as, in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, the millstone is called a man's life, inasmuch as it supplies the means of life.

First, the elders and judges (presumably of the neighboring towns; of Josephus, 'Antiq.' 4:8, 16) were to meet, the former as magistrates representing the communities, the latter as administrators of the law, and were to measure the distance from the body of the slain man to each of the surrounding towns, in order to ascertain which was the nearest.

This is an ethical regulation in the interests of morality. There is no reference, as some have supposed, to the wearing of masks for the purpose of disguise, or to the practice of the priests at heathen festivals of wearing masks of their gods. Whatever tends to obliterate the distinction between the sexes tends to licentiousness; and that the one sex should assume the dress of the other has always been regarded as unnatural and indecent (comp. Seneca, 'Epist.,' 122, "Nonne videntur contra naturam vivere qui commutant cum feminis vestem;" and Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 6:252 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Quem praestare potest muller galeata pudorem<br />Quae fugit a sexu?"</span>) Such a change of vesture is here declared to be an abomination to the Lord, because of its tendency to immorality.

This law, however, was one of the ordinances intended for the period of nonage; it had reference to the outward typical aspect of the Israelitish constitution; and it ceased to have any significance when the spiritual kingdom of God came to be established. Even under the theocracy, eunuchs were not excluded from religious privileges; they could keep God's Sabbaths, and take hold of his covenant, and choose the things pleasing to him, and so be part of the spiritual Israel, though shut out from the fellowship of that which was outward and national (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4</a>).

By this law the priests are directed how to proceed with those afflicted with leprosy; and here the people are counseled by Moses to follow the directions of the priests in this case, however painful it might be for them to submit to the restrictions that would be thereby imposed upon them, remembering what the Lord did to Miriam the sister of Moses, how even she was separated from the camp by the express command of God until she was healed (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>). Michaelis, Keil, and others, following the Vulgate ("Observa diligenter ne incurras plagam leprae sed facies quaecunque docuerint to sacerdotes"), understand this passage as inculcating obedience to the priests, lest leprosy should be incurred as a punishment for disobedience. But it is improbable that a general counsel to submit to the priests should be introduced among the special counsels here given; and besides, the formula <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> means, "Take heed to yourself in respect of" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>), rather than "Beware of," or "Be on your guard against."

He might stand outside and summon the debtor to produce his pledge, but he was not insolently to enter the house and lay hands on any part of the owner's property. To stand outside and call is still a common mode of seeking access to a person in his own house or apartment among the Arabs, and is regarded as the only respectful mode. There would be thus a mitigation of the severity of the exaction, the tendency of which would be to preserve good feeling between the parties. If the debtor was needy, and being such could give in pledge only some necessary article, such as his upper garment in which he slept at night, the pledge was to be returned ere nightfall, that the man might sleep in his own raiment, and have a grateful feeling towards his creditor. In many parts of the East, with the Arabs notably, it is customary for the poor to sleep in their outer garment. "During the day the poor while at work can and do dispense with this outside raiment, but at night it is greatly needed, even in summer. This furnishes a good reason why this sort of pledge should be restored before night" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:192, 500). The earlier legislation (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25, 26</a>) is evidently assumed here as well known by the people. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be righteousness unto thee</span> (see on Deuteronomy 6:25).

Though God, in the exercise of his absolute sovereignty, might visit the sins of the parent upon the children (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), earthly judges were not to assume this power.

This prohibition, therefore, was dictated by a regard to the rights and claims of animals employed in labor; but there is involved in it the general principle that all labor is to be duly requited, and hence it seems to have passed into a proverb, and was applied to men as well as the lower animals (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-9.htm">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>).

If a man who was married died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to raise up a successor to the deceased, who should be his heir.

The design of this institution - which was not originated by Moses, but came down from early times (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>), and is to be found amongst ether nations than the Jews, and that even in the present day - was to preserve a family from becoming extinct and to secure the property of a family from passing into the hands of a stranger.

As the planting of the shod foot on a piece of property, or the casting of the shoe over a field, was emblematical of taking possession of it with satisfaction (<a href="../../par/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>); and as the voluntary handing of one's shoe to another betokened the giving up to that other of some property or right; so, contrariwise, the forcible removal from one of his shoe and the casting of it aside indicated contemptuous rejection of the owner, and repudiation of all his rights and claims in the matter. To walk barefooted was regarded by the Jews as ignominious and miserable (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>).

Moses has already repeatedly reminded the Israelites that they had utterly to destroy the wicked nations of Canaan; and he here closes this discourse by reminding them that there was a nation outside of Canaan which was also doomed, and which they were to root out. This was Amalek, which had attacked the Israelites in their journey at Rephidim, and had taken advantage of their exhausted condition to harass their rear and destroy those who, faint and weary, had lagged behind. For this they had been already punished by the Israelites, who, led on by Joshua, had turned upon them and discomfited them with the edge of the sword. This, however, was not enough; Amalek was to be utterly destroyed, and this the Israelites were to effect as soon as the Lord had given them rest in the Promised Land.

The tithe here referred to is the vegetable or predial tithe, which, at the end of each third year, as here prescribed, was to be converted into a gift to the poor and needy. This, properly the second tithe (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but usually called the third tithe (Tobit 1:7, 8; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 22), is quite distinct from the Levitical tithe prescribed in <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-32</a>; and it is a mistake to suppose that the law here was designed to contravene or supersede that in the earlier books (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:1010). As this tithe completed the triennial series of tithes which the Israelites had to offer, it was fitting that in presenting it a solemn declaration should be made by the offerer to the effect that he had honorably and conscientiously discharged all the obligations in this respect which the Law laid upon him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third year, which is the year of tithing</span>.

Or the reference may be here to the expenses incurred by the death of one for whose funeral the individual had to provide. This view is adopted by Dr. Thomson, who, remarking on this passage, says, "This was the strongest possible protestation that he had dealt faithfully in the matter of tithing and consecrated things and in charities to the poor. He had not allowed himself to divert anything to other uses, not even by the most pressing and unforeseen emergencies. It is here assumed, or rather implied, that times of mourning for the dead were expensive, and also that the stern law of custom obliged the bereaved to defray those expenses, however onerous.... The temptation, therefore, to devote a part of the tithes, hallowed things, and charities to defray these enormous, unforeseen, and providential expenses would be very urgent, and he who stood faithful at such times might safely be trusted on all other occasions" ('Land and the Book,' 1:149). The LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "to the dead," has led some to suppose that the reference here is to the placing of articles of food in the tomb along with the corpse; but though this custom prevailed among the Jews in later times, as well as among other peoples, there is no ground for supposing it to be referred to here. As all connected with a dead body was held to be unclean, as well as the body itself, a house of mourning with its inhabitants was held to he unclean, and into it, therefore, nothing that had been hallowed might be lawfully carried.

That the words were not, as Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others suppose, cut in the stone, and afterwards covered with plaster in order to preserve them, is plain from its being enjoined that they were to be written upon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) the stones so prepared; and besides, as this was intended to be a <span class="accented">proclamation</span> of the Law, the main purpose of the erection would have been frustrated had the inscription been concealed by such a covering as that supposed. Among the ancient Egyptians the practice of depicting records on walls or monuments covered with a coating of plaster was common (see Hengstenberg, 'Authentic des Pent.,' 1:464, English translation, 1:433); from them, doubtless, it was borrowed by the Hebrews. It has been suggested by Kennicott that the writing was to be in <span class="accented">relieve</span>, and that the spaces between the letters were filled up by the mortar or cement. This is possible, but it is not such a process as this that the words of the text suggest.

By the "Law" here cannot be intended merely the blessings and the curses afterwards mentioned (vers. 14-26); nor is there any reason why this term should be restricted to the precepts of this Book of Deuteronomy, as if they only were to be inscribed on the stones: the term must be extended so as to cover all that Moses had at any time delivered to Israel as a law from God. It is not necessary, however, to suppose that <span class="accented">all</span> the reasons and exhortations with which the delivery of these, as recorded in the Pentateuch, was accompanied were to be inscribed along with the Law; still less that the historical details amidst which the record of these laws is embedded should be given. It may be questioned even whether <span class="accented">each</span> and <span class="accented">all</span> of the legislative enactments of the Torah, reckoned by the Jews to be 613, were to be recorded; for it might be deemed enough that the substance and essence of the Law should be thus presented. But even if the whole was to be inscribed, there would be no serious difficulty in the way of carrying this into effect, seeing there is no limitation as to the number of the stones to be set up.

The stones and the altar were fittingly placed on Ebal, the mount of cursing. For the setting up of the stones on which the Law was inscribed, and the building beside them of the altar, was the symbolical renewal of the covenant of God with Israel, and the establishment in Canaan of that dispensation which was "the ministration of condemnation and of death" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7, 9</a>), and of that Law which, though in itself "holy, just, and <span class="accented">good</span>," can only, because of man's perversity and sinfulness, bring on those who are under it a curse (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>).

For this purpose six tribes were to station themselves on Mount Gerizim, and six on Mount Ebal, the former to pronounce the blessing, the latter the curse. (On the situation of these two mountains, see at ch. Deuteronomy 11:29.) The six tribes by whom the blessing was to be pronounced were Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin, all descended from the two wives of Jacob - Leah and Rachel. The tribes by whom the curse was to be uttered were those descended from Zilpah, Leah's maid, viz. Gad and Asher; those descended from Bilhah, Rachel's maid, viz. Dan and Naphtali; with Zebulun and Reuben, both descended from Leah. As, in order to obtain a division of the tribes into two equal portions, two of the sons of Leah must be assigned to the second half, Zebulun and Reuben were chosen, probably because the former was the youngest of Leah's sons, and the latter had by his sin forfeited his birthright (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>).

The blessings are not here recorded; but when the injunction here given was fulfilled by Joshua, the blessing as well as the curse was pronounced (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-34.htm">Joshua 8:34</a>). And probably, as the Jews report, each, the blessing and the curse, was pronounced alternately (Talmud Bab., 'Sotah,' p. 7; Targum Hieros., <span class="accented">in loc</span>.; Surcnhus., 'Mishna,' 3:262). It has sometimes been doubted whether any human voice could be audible over so wide a stretch as that between these two mountains; but this need be no longer matter of doubt, for the experiment has been repeatedly tried in recent times with success (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 150; Bonar, p. 371; Stanley, 'Syr. and Pal.,' p. 13). In the clear atmosphere of the East sounds travel far. It is to be borne in mind also that it was not a single voice that had to make itself heard across the valley on this occasion, but a chorus of voices pro-seeding from a body of priests stationed apparently in the midst between the two companies (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>), and chanting in unison the words of each blessing or curse. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-26.</span> - Each of the first eleven curses is directed against some particular sin already denounced in the Law. The twelfth curse is directed generally against all breaches of the Law, against those who fail or refuse to set up the whole Law and follow it as the rule of life and conduct. This shows that the sins specially denounced are selected by way of specimen, and also, perhaps, because they are such as could for the most part be easily concealed from judicial inspection. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23</span>. - (Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9, 17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7, 8</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-3.htm">Jeremiah 11:3, 4</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

At this point the language of address is exchanged for that of narrative. The change of subject from "ye abode" to "we turned," became necessary when Moses passed from exhorting and warning the people to narrating what happened after they resumed their journeyings; and gives no support to the notion of some recent German critics, that Moses left Kadesh with only a portion of the people, while the rest remained there, so that no entire departure of Israel from Kadesh ever took place - a notion which the whole tenor of the subsequent narrative contradicts. In obedience to the Divine command (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40</a>), the people, after tarrying for a while at Kadesh, took their departure and marched in the direction of the Yam-suph (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we compassed mount Seir many days.</span> These "many days" are the thirty-eight years during which the people wandered in the wilderness before they camped the second time at Kadesh; their going round Mount Seir, which was in Edom (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8, 9, 20</a>), is descriptive of their nomadic wanderings in various directions, west, south, and south-east of that mountain (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>). "Crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4, 5</a>), the Israelites issued into the great and elevated plains which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims on their way to Mecca; and appear to have followed <span class="accented">northward</span> nearly the same route which is now taken by the Syrian Hadgi along the western skirts of this great desert near the mountains of Edom" (Robinson, 'Bib.

Sihon and his people were Amorites, who had settled on the east of the Jordan in Gilead. But though not included in the original promise to Abraham, God had assigned this territory to the Israelites; and, therefore, he commanded the people under Moses to cross the Amen, and take the first step towards possessing the Promised Land, by assailing Sihon, King of Heshbon, assuring them that from that day he would "put the dread and fear of them upon all nations under the whole heaven," that is, all nations, wherever placed, to whom the fame of the Israelites should come (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>), so that on hearing thereof, they should tremble and writhe as in pain (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). Moses, however, in the first instance, sent a message of peace to Sihon, proposing to pass through his territory on the same terms as he had made with the Moabites and Edomites, traveling by the highway, and paying for such provisions as his followers required. But this Sihon refused, and came out against Israel, with all his people, to battle. The issue was that he was utterly discomfited; all his towns were captured, he and all his people utterly destroyed, and the cattle and spoil of the whole country taken for booty. Israel thus became possessed of that entire territory, though it did not lie within the bounds of the land promised by God to Abraham, which was the reason, probably, why Moses made overtures of peace to Sihon, and would have passed through his country amicably, had he been permitted; but comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>.

It is not to be supposed that any influence was <span class="accented">directly</span> exerted on him, to make him obdurate and persistent in his hostility to the people of God; the expression "he would not" indicates that it was of his own will that Sihon acted; but it was the will and purpose of God that Sihon should be destroyed, and his country taken by the Israelites, and so he was placed in circumstances by which, "given over to a reprobate mind," he was confirmed and strengthened m his determination to pursue a course which led to his destruction; like Pharaoh, by the circumstances in which God placed him, he found scope for the display and for the confirmation of a stubborn, pertinacious pride of spirit, which led ultimately to his ruin.

When dispersed among the nations, if the people should return to Jehovah their God, he would again receive them into favor and gather them from their dispersion (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>, etc.). Moses, looking into the future, anticipates that both the blessing and the curse would come upon the people according as they were faithful to their covenant engagement and obedient to God's Law, or were disobedient and unfaithful. But even when the curse came upon them to the full, this would not amount to final rejection; but God would, by the discipline of suffering, lead them to repentance, and then he would again bestow the blessing (cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call them to mind</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>, where the same expression is rendered by "bethink themselves"). This is the meaning here also; it is not the mere recollection of the curse and the blessing that is referred to, but a general consideration of their own condition and conduct.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-4.htm">Deuteronomy 30:4</a></div><div class="verse">If <i>any</i> of thine be driven out unto the outmost <i>parts</i> of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - Consequent on this deliverance would be the gathering of Israel from all the places of the dispersion and their return to possess the land which their fathers possessed, in greater numbers than their fathers were. This last statement suggests doubt as to the literal interpretation of this prediction, for, as Keil remarks, "If there is to be an increase in the num-bet of the Jews when gathered out of their dispersion into all the world, above the number of their fathers, and therefore above the number of the Israelites in the time of Solomon and the first monarchs of the two kingdoms, Palestine will never furnish room enough for a nation multiplied like this." The reference in the following verse to a spiritual renewal suggests the inquiry whether the reference here is not to such a gathering and restoration of Israel as that which St. Paul describes in <a href="../../par/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, when the branches that had been broken from the olive tree shall be again grafted into it, and all Israel shall be saved after the fullness of the Gentiles shall be, brought in. To Moses, and indeed to all the Old Testament prophets and saints, the Israel of God presented itself as a nation dwelling in a land given to it by God; but as the national Israel was the type of the spiritual Israel, and as Canaan was the type of the spiritual kingdom of God, the full import of what is said concerning the former is only to be perceived when it is viewed as realized in the latter. Certain it is that it was on this principle that the apostles interpreted the fulfillment of the Old Testament declarations concerning Israel, of which the explanation given by St. James of <a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11, 12</a> may be noted as an instructive example (<a href="../../par/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-17</a>). If the rebuilding of the ruined tabernacle of David is to be effected by "the residue of men" being brought to "seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom his Name is called," we need not shrink from interpreting this prophecy of Moses as referring to the restoration of Israel by the bringing in of Jew and Gentile into the one fold under the one Shepherd, the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="../../par/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>).

There is no need, therefore, for resorting, with Raschi and others, to the expedient of reading "for" instead of "and" in the following clause; as if the cause why Moses could no longer go in and out among the people was God's prohibition of his going over Jordan. This is simply another and collateral reason why he had now to retire flora his post as leader.

Moses "entrusted the reading to the priesthood and the college of elders, as the spiritual and secular rulers of the congregation; and hence the singular, Thou shalt read this Law to all Israel" (Keil). By the Law here is meant the Pentateuch; but it does not necessarily follow that the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the Pentateuch was to be thus read. As the reading was to be only once in seven years, it may be concluded that it was not so much for the information of the people that this was done, as for the purpose of publicly declaring, and by a solemn ceremony impressing on their minds the condition on which they held their position and privileges as the chosen people of the Lord; and for this the reading of select portions of the Torah would be sufficient.

Whether this section is to be regarded as wholly written by Moses himself, or as an appendix to his writing added by some other writer, has been made matter of question. It is quite possible, however, that Moses himself, ere he laid down the pen, may have recorded what he said when delivering the Book of the Law to the priests, and there is nothing in the manner or style of the record to render it probable that it was added by another. What follows from ver. 30 to the end of the book was probably added to the writing of Moses by some one after his death, though, of course, both the song in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, and  the blessing in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, are the composition of Moses (see Introduction, &sect; 6).

The epithet is applied to God four times besides in this song (vers. 15, 18, 30, 31); it occurs also frequently in the Psalms (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2, 7</a>; etc.). The Hebrew word, <span class="accented">tsur</span>, <span class="accented">gut</span>, or <span class="accented">zur</span>, appears in several proper names of the Mosaic period, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Pedahzur</span>, "Rock delivers" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>), a name of the same import as <span class="accented">Pedahel</span>, "God delivers" (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-28.htm">Numbers 34:28</a>); <span class="accented">Elizur</span>, "God is a Rock" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5</a>); <span class="accented">Zuriel</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-35.htm">Numbers 3:35</a>) and <span class="accented">Zurishaddai</span>, "the Almighty is Rock" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-6.htm">Numbers 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>). "Jehovah," says Baumgarten, "is here called <span class="accented">Rock</span>, without any qualification, the reason is that he is the only true rock, and all the strength and firmness of earth's stones is but an ectype of his unchangeable faithfulness and rectitude. If one cleaves to the dualism of spirit and nature, and regards the figure as a merely subjective, arbitrary union of the two, such an expression is simply unintelligible; but if we would understand Scripture and religious speech, we must with all earnestness accustom ourselves to recognize the spiritual ground in nature, and apprehend this in the Biblical expression (comp. Steffens' 'Religionsphilosophie,' 1. s. 101, 102)." It is remarkable that none of the ancient versions have retained this epithet here. The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dens</span> ("Dei opera"); the Targum of Onkelos, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, "Mighty;" while the Peshito has simply the pronoun "his" appended to "works," . <span class="cmt_word">For all his ways are judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. accordant with rectitude (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A God of truth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of faithfulness</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to stay, or be stayed, to be firm). <span class="cmt_word">They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</span> Of this difficult passage the following seems the best construction and rendering: - <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">perverse and crooked generation not his children</span>, [but] <span class="accented">their spot - has become corrupt towards him</span>. The subject of the verb at the beginning of the verse is the "perverse and crooked generation," at the end of it, and between the verb and its subject there is interjected parenthetically the clause, "not his children, but their spot." <span class="accented">Spot</span> is here used in a moral sense, as in <a href="../../par/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>. These corrupt persons claimed to be children of God, but they were not; they were rather a stain and a reproach to them (cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). The rendering above given is substantially that of De Wette, Knobel, Keil, and Herxheimer, by all of whom the "perverse generation "is regarded as the subject of the sentence. This is the view adopted also in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' Some would make "God" the subject, and render, "He hath corrupted to him, or to himself" (margin, Authorized Version; Ibn Ezra, etc.). Others take "spot" as the subject, thus: "Their spot or blemish hath corrupted before him children not his" (Lowth, Dathe); but such renderings are forced, and proceed on constructions of the text which are illegitimate. Donaldson ('Jashar,' pp. 186, 223, edit. See.), following Lowth's construction, appeals to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (ver. 20) as a similar inversion. But the two cases are not parallel. To make them so, we must have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, "his children in whom is no spot." Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as the noun here, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, and tracing it to the Syriac , <span class="accented">juravit</span>, renders "to him they, his not sons, have corrupted their oath," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. have broken it; and this Furst approves. But the phrase, "to corrupt an oath" is unexampled in the Old Testament, and there is no ground for changing the noun. The ancient versions vary considerably here: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>: Aq., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: Sym., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">peccaverunt ei et non filii ejus in sordibus</span>; Ver. Itala., <span class="accented">peeca verunt non ei filii maculati</span>; Syriac, "They corrupted but not him, children of defilement." These various renderings indicate that probably the text is and has long been corrupt. Some of the older English versions are worth noting on this verse. Rogers [Matthew], "The frowarde and overthwart generation hath marred them selves to himward, and are not his sonnes for their deformitie's sake;" Bishop's Bible, "Frowardly have they done agaynst him by their vices, not being his own children, but a wicked and froward generation;" Geneva Version, "They have corrupted themselves towards him by their vice, not  being his children, but a froward and crooked generation."

By Delitzsch and others this explanation of the word is rejected as not philologically justified, there being no evidence that the termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> had a diminutive force; and as not in keeping with the earnestness of the passages in which this word occurs. They prefer the explanation <span class="accented">man image</span> to <span class="accented">mannikin</span>. Anyhow, the use of the word here must be taken as indicating that Israel is ever in the eye of the Lord, the object of his constant and tenderest care. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a></div><div class="verse">As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - God's treatment of his people is compared to that of an eagle towards its young (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>). In the Authorized Version, the apodosis of the sentence is made to begin at ver. 12, and ver. 11 is wholly understood of the eagle and its young. To this arrangement it has been objected that it overlooks the fact that the suffixes to the verbs "taketh" and "beareth" are singulars, and are to be understood consequently, not of the eaglets, but of Israel. It has, therefore, been proposed to render the passage thus: <span class="accented">As an eagle which stirreth up its nest</span>, <span class="accented">fluttereth over its young</span>, <span class="accented">he spread out his wings</span>, <span class="accented">took him up</span>, <span class="accented">and carried him on his pinions</span>. <span class="accented">The Lord alone did lead him</span>, etc. The comparison is thus made to pass into a metaphorical representation of the Lord's dealing with Israel. One feels that there is something violent in this, for whilst God's care for Israel might be fittingly <span class="accented">compared to</span> that of an eagle towards her young, it is less fit to speak of God himself as if he <span class="accented">were</span> an eagle with wings which he spread abroad and on which he bare Israel. The rendering in the Authorized Version is on this account to be preferred, if it can be grammatically vindicated. And this it may on the ground that the suffixes may be understood of the "nest" as containing the young ("continens pro contento," a common rhetorical trope in Scripture; see Glass., 'Philippians Sac.,' p. 686; cf. Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:475, "nidisque loquacibus escam"); or the young may be referred to individually, "taketh it, beareth it," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. each of them; or, if the nest be understood, the whole body of them as therein contained. <span class="cmt_word">Stirreth up her</span> [its] <span class="cmt_word">nest</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. its nestlings; <span class="accented">provocans ad</span>  <span class="accented">volandum pullos suos</span>, <span class="accented">Vulgate</span>. This is the explanation usually given of the initial clause of this verse; but its accuracy has been questioned, Furst would render the verb by "watchesover; "but though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, as the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to watch, may have this meaning, it is undoubtedly used generally in the sense of rousing, exciting, stirring up. Knobel retains this meaning, but understands the clause of the exciting of the nestlings by the parent bird coming to them with food. This is certainly more in keeping with what follows; for when the eagle nestles or broods over her young, she does not excite them to fly. <span class="cmt_word">Fluttereth over her young</span>; rather, <span class="accented">broods over</span>, <span class="accented">nestles</span>, or <span class="accented">cherishes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Spreadeth abroad her wings,</span> etc. "I once saw a very interesting sight above one of the crags of Ben Nevis, as I was going in pursuit of black game. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of a mountain, in the eye of the sun; - it was about midday, and bright for this climate. They at first made small circles, and the young imitated them; they paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their first flight, holding them on their expanded wings when they appeared exhausted, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising towards the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight, so as to make a gradually ascending spiral" (Davy, 'Salinertia;' see also Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 2:181). The general reference is to God's fostering care of Israel, and especially his dealing with them when "he suffered their manners in the wilderness" (<a href="../../par/acts/13-18.htm">Acts 13:18</a>), disciplined them, and trained them for what they were appointed to do.

There is no ground for the explanation "fery wine" (Keil); wine in such a state was never among the Hebrews counted a blessing. That they had and used fermented wine is certain; but what they specially esteemed as a luxury was the pure unadulterated juice of the grape freshly pressed out and drunk with the foam on it.

"By using the name <span class="accented">righteous</span> in place of <span class="accented">Israel</span>, Moses ironically censures those who had swerved from rectitude; by recalling to memory with what dignity they had been endowed, he the more sharply rebukes the perfidy which was their crime" (Calvin).

The "this" in ver. 34 is by some understood of the sinful doings of the Israelites which God should not forget or overlook. So the Targum of Onkelos: "Are not all their works manifest before me, kept against the day of judgment in my treasures?" So also Calvin, "<span class="accented">Quanquam</span> de poenis hunc versum quidam exponunt, acsi Deus assereret diversas earum species apud se paratas esse, quas depromat quoties libuerit: rectius tamen est de sceleribus intelligere."

Not only the deeds of the transgressors, but the judgments that should come on Israel, and also God's interposition on their behalf, <span class="accented">were laid up in store with him</span>, <span class="accented">and sealed up among his treasures</span>. All that had been done had been noted, and all that should happen was decreed, and should certainly come to pass.

These places are not mentioned as scenes of different manifestations of the Divine glory, but as indicating the extent to which the one manifestation given at Sinai reached. The light of the Divine glory that rested on Sinai was reflected also from the mountains of Seir and Paran (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He came with ten thousands of saints</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he came from ten thousands of holy ones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">out from myriads of holiness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "from his celestial seat, where myriads of angels surround his throne" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The rendering "with," though that of the Targum, LXX., and Vulgate, cannot be retained; nor does Scripture represent God as attended by angels when he comes forth to manifest his glory to men. They are represented as surrounding his throne in heaven (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), as his servants awaiting his behest, and his host that do his pleasure (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>); and God is represented as dwelling in the midst of them (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>). Hence he is represented here as coming forth from among them to manifest himself to his people. <span class="cmt_word">A fiery law</span>. There is a various reading here; instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, fire of law, many codices have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> in one word, and this is supported by the Samaritan text and other authorities, and is accepted by most critics and interpreters. It is a fatal objection to the textual reading that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is not a Semitic word, but one of Persian origin, brought by the Jews from Babylonia, and found only in the post-exilian books (<a href="../../par/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9, 13, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5, 9, 13, 16</a>); and in them as applied to the Law of God only by heathens. It is, therefore, altogether improbable that this word should be found in any Hebrew writing anterior to the Captivity. Besides, what is the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, supposing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> to mean "law?" The words cannot be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, by "fiery law;" they can only be rendered by "a fire, a law," or "a fire of law," and What either of these may mean it is not easy to see. The ancient versions vary here very considerably: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">fin dextera ejus ignea lex</span>; Targum of Onkelos, "Written by his right hand, from the midst of the fire, a law gave he to us;" Syriac, "With myriads of his saints at his right hand. He gave to them, and also caused all peoples to love them." The best Hebrew manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> as one word. The Masoretic note is, "The <span class="accented">Chatiph is</span> one word, and the <span class="accented">K'ri</span> two." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> is best explained as a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, an Aramaic word signifying to throw or dart; the Syriac , or the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, having the same signification, so that the meaning is "fire-dartings:" from his right hand went rays of fire like arrows shot forth (cf. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Israelites, to whom this manifestation was vouchsafed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <i>are</i> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; <i>every one</i> shall receive of thy words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he loved the people.</span> The proper rendering is, <span class="accented">he loveth peoples</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). This is generally understood of the tribes of Israel; but some would understand it of nations in general, on the ground that such is the proper meaning of the word, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> and other places. A reference to nations at large, however, would seem incongruous here; and the use of the word in relation to Israel in such passages as <a href="../../par/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>; Hoe. 10:14; <a href="../../par/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>, justifies the taking it so here. <span class="cmt_word">All his saints are in thy hand.</span> The people of Israel are here called God's saints, or holy ones, because they were chosen by and consecrated to him. It is not probable, as some suggest, that the angels are here intended. The change from the third person to the second is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They sat down at thy feet.</span> The verb rendered "sat down" here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) is found only in this passage, and is of uncertain meaning. Kimchi explains it as "<span class="accented">they</span> <span class="accented">united</span> or <span class="accented">assembled together to follow thy steps</span>;" Knobel makes it "they <span class="accented">wandered at thy feet</span>," and understands it of Israel's following the lead of Jehovah in the wilderness, when the ark of the covenant preceded them in their march; Gesenius and Furst, "they <span class="accented">lie down at thy feet</span>." This last is accepted by Keil, and seems to have most in its favor. <span class="cmt_word">Every one shall receive of thy words.</span> Some render here, <span class="accented">they rise up at thy words</span>; but though the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> is sometimes used intransitively, it is properly an active verb, and there seems no reason why it should not be so regarded here: <span class="accented">every one receives</span> [the singular, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span>, used distributively] <span class="accented">thy words</span>.

The Law which Moses communicated to Israel was to remain with them as the inheritance f the congregation. The Bishops' Bible and the Geneva Version have, more correctly, "for an inheritance of the congregation." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people <i>and</i> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Some refer this to Moses, but Moses was never recognized as king in Israel: he "was faithful in all his house as a servant" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>); but Jehovah alone was King (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-6.htm">Psalm 47:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jeshurun</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a></div><div class="verse">Let Reuben live, and not die; and let <i>not</i> his men be few.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-25.</span> <span class="accented">- Blessings on the tribes individually</span>. With these may be compared the blessing which Jacob pronounced on his sons as representing the tribes of which they were the heads. The two resemble each other in many points; the differences are such as naturally arose from the different relations of the speakers to the objects of their address, and the changes in the condition and prospects of the tribes which during the lapse of centuries had come to pass. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let not his men be few.</span> The negative, though not expressed in the Hebrew, is to be carried into this clause from the preceding. Though the rights of primogeniture had been withdrawn from Reuben, and Jacob had declared that he should not excel, Moses here assures the tribe of continuance, and even prosperity. Their number was not to be small; which was, perhaps, said to comfort them, in view of the fact that their numbers had greatly diminished in the course of their wanderings in the desert (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/1-21.htm">Numbers 1:21</a> with Numbers 26:7). At no time, however, was this tribe numerous as compared with the others; nor was it ever distinguished either by the enterprise of its members or by the eminence of any of them in the councils of the nation or the management of affairs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-7.htm">Deuteronomy 33:7</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>is the blessing</i> of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help <i>to him</i> from his enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The blessing on Judah is in the form of prayer to Jehovah. As Jacobhad promised to Judah supremacy over his brethren and success in war, so Moses here names him next after Reuben, whose pre-eminence he had assumed, and prays for him that, going forth at the head of the tribes, he might return in triumph, being helped of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Let his hands be sufficient for him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with his hands he contendeth for it</span> (to wit, <span class="accented">his people</span>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> here is not the adj. much, enough, but the part. of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, to contend, to strive; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> is the aeons, of instrument. The rendering in the Authorized Version is grammatically possible; but the meaning thereby brought out is not in keeping with the sentiment of the passage; for if Judah's hands, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his own power and resources, were sufficient for him, what need had he of help from the Lord? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a></div><div class="verse">And of Levi he said, <i>Let</i> thy Thummim and thy Urim <i>be</i> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <i>and with</i> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - The blessing on Levi is also in the form of a prayer. In Jacob's blessing, Simeon is joined with Levi, but Moses passes him over altogether, probably because, as Jacob foretold, he was to be scattered among his brethren (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>), and so lose his tribal individuality. Simeon, however, is included in the general blessing pronounced on Israel; and as this tribe received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-9</a>), it was probably regarded as included in the blessing on that tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Thy Thummim and thy Urim</span>; <span class="accented">thy Right and thy Light</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The high priest wore the breast-plate on which these were placed when he went in before the Lord; and this is here represented as the prerogative of the whole tribe. Thy holy one; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Levi, the tribe-father, representing the whole tribe to which the blessing applies; hence in the following verses the verb passes into the plural. For "holy one," it would be better to read "pious" or "godly one;" literally, <span class="accented">the man thy pious one</span>. Some would render "the man thy favored one," or "the man of thy friendship;" but this is wholly arbitrary, the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) has no such meaning. To explain this more particularly, reference is made to the trials at <span class="cmt_word">Massah</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the waters of Meribah</span> (strife), when the people rebelled and murmured against Moses and Aaron, whereby the piety of these men was put to the test, and in them, the heads of the tribe of Levi, the whole tribe was proved. (On Massah, see <a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>; and on the waters of strife, see <a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>.) In these trials, Levi had proved himself faithful and godly, having risen up in defense of the honor of Jehovah, and in support of his covenant, though in the latter case both Moses and Aaron stumbled. <span class="cmt_word">Who said unto his father and to his mother</span>, etc. This refers to what is narrated in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, when the Levites drew their swords against their brethren at the command of Moses, to execute judgment without respect of person, because of the sin of the people in the matter of the golden calf (cf. also <a href="../../par/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, and, for the principle here implicitly commended, see <a href="../../par/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).  Because of their zealous devotion to the claims and service of the Lord, the dignity of the priesthood had been conferred on this tribe; and to them belonged the high office of being instructors of the people in Divine things, and of presenting the sacrifices of the people to the Lord. For those entrusted with such an office, nothing was more to be desired than that they should be blessed with power rightly to discharge the duties of their office, that their service should be accepted with favor, and that their enemies and haters should be foiled and rendered impotent; and for this Moses prays on their behalf.

There can be no doubt that Benjamin is the subject of this clause; to understand it of Jehovah dwelling on the shoulders of Benjamin, in the sense of having the temple, the place of his rest, within the territory of Benjamin, is too violent and far-fetched an interpretation to be admitted.

There is this difference, however, between the two blessings, that in that of the patriarch it is the growth of the tribe in power and might that is chiefly contemplated; whilst in that of Moses it is the advance of the tribe in wealth, prosperity, and influence that is chiefly indicated. "Jacob described the growth of Joseph under the figure of a luxuriant branch of a fruit tree planted by the water; whilst Moses fixes his eye primarily upon the land of Joseph, and desires for him the richest productions" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For the precious things of heaven, for the dew</span>.

Probably, however, this is only a correction, to bring this passage into accordance with <a href="../../par/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>. The Targums and the Peshito combine both readings. Instead of "<span class="accented">for</span> the precious things," it is better to read "with," etc., and so throughout vers. 13-16.

The oxen are Joseph's sons, all of whom were strong, but the firstborn excelled the rest, and was endowed with majesty.

"Although 'going out' (enterprise, labor) is attributed to Zebulun, and 'remaining in tents' (the comfortable enjoyment of life) to Issachar, in accordance with the delineation of their respective characters in the blessing of Jacob, this is to be attributed to the poetic parallelism of the clauses, and the whole is to be understood as applying to both in the sense suggested by Graf, 'Rejoice, Zebulun and Issachar, in your labor and your rest'" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">They shall call the people unto the mountain;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they shall call nations to the mountain</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the mountain of the Lord's inheritance (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>), the place of his sanctuary. <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifices of righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sacrifices offered according to God's Law, and in a manner and a spirit well pleasing to him (<a href="../../par/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>; 51:21). <span class="cmt_word">They shall suck of the abundance of the seas</span>, etc. The treasures of both sea and land should be theirs.

The word rendered t, lawgiver," or "leader" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>), signifies primarily one who ordains or appoints, and is used in both the above senses (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>); it is here applied to Gad, because that tribe displayed such promptitude and energy at the head of the tribes in the conquest of the land, that it might be regarded as their leader. An entirely different view of the passage has been taken by some, who by the <span class="accented">mechokek</span> understand Moses as the lawgiver, and his portion as the place of his grave, which was concealed, but was within the inheritance of Gad. But it is a fatal objection to this view that not only is the word rendered "portion" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) nowhere used of a grave, but the grave of Moses on Mount Nebo was in the territory of Reuben, not in that of Gad. Gesenius renders, "The portion of (assigned by) the lawgiver was preserved." But this does not tally with the immediately preceding statement, that Gad <span class="accented">chose</span> his portion for himself; at any rate, it could not be <span class="accented">because</span> of this that he chose it.

The proper meaning of the word is to be retained here. As the territory of Naphtali lay in the north of Canaan, and was far from the sea, the blessing here pronounced upon him must be understood generally of prosperity and felicity.

The rabbins say that Moses was buried by retiring into a cavern, where he died and where his body remained. It is probable that, like Enoch  and Elijah, he was transferred to the invisible world without seeing corruption. Hence his appearance along with Elijah in bodily form on the Mount of the Transfiguration; and hence also, perhaps, the tradition of the contest for the body of Moses between Michael and Satan (<a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>). If the body of <span class="accented">Moses</span> was actually buried, the concealment of his grave so that no man knew of it may be justly regarded as "the first instance on record of the providential obliteration, so remarkably exemplified afterwards in the gospel history, of the ' holy places' of Palestine; the providential safeguard against their elevation to a sanctity which might endanger the real holiness of the history and religion which they served to commemorate" (Stanley). The reverence which the Jews paid to graves shows that there was no small danger of their coming under a superstitious regard to that of Moses had it been known.

This district is now known as the province of <span class="accented">El-Lejah</span> (The Retreat). It is described as oval in form, about twenty-two miles long by fourteen wide; a plateau elevated about thirty feet above the surrounding plain. Its features are most remarkable. It is composed of a thick stratum of black basalt, which seems to have been emitted in a liquid state from pores in the earth, and to have flowed out on all sides till the whole surface was covered. It is rent and shattered as if by internal convulsion. The cup-like cavities from which the liquid mass was projected are still seen, and also the wavy surface such as a thick liquid generally assumes which cools as it is flowing. There are deep fissures and yawning gulfs with rugged, broken edges; and there are jagged mounds that seem not to have been sufficiently heated to flow, but which were forced up by some mighty agency, and then rent and shattered to their centers. The rock is filled with air-bubbles, and is almost as hard as iron. (Dr. Porter, in Kitto, 'Biblical Cyclopaedia,' 3:1032; see also the same author's 'Five Years in Damascus,' 2:240, etc.; and 'The Giant Cities of Bashan'; Burckhardt, 'Travels in Syria,' p. 110, etc.; Wetstein, 'Reisebericht fib.

The entire trans-Jordanic region was thus captured by the Israelites.

Over that district tire strewn a multitude of towns of various sizes, all constructed after the same remarkable fashion. "The streets are perfect, the walls perfect, and, what seems more astonish. tug, the stone doors are still hanging on their hinges, so little impression has been made during these many centuries on the hard and durable stone of which they are built" (Graham, <span class="accented">Cambridge Essays</span>, p. 160). These doors are "formed of slabs of stone, opening on pivots which are projecting parts of the stone itself, and working in sockets in the lintel and threshold." Some of these gates are large enough to admit of a camel passing through them, and the doors are of proportionate dimensions, some of the stones of which they are formed being eighteen inches in thickness. The roofs also are formed of huge stone slabs resting on the massive walls. All betoken the workmanship of a race endowed with powers far exceeding those of ordinary men; and give credibility to the supposition that we have in them the dwellings of the giant race that occupied that district before it was invaded by the Israelites. "We could not help," says Mr. Graham, "being impressed with the belief that had we never known anything of the early portion of Scripture history before visiting this country, we should have been forced to the conclusion that its original inhabitants, the people who had constructed those cities, were not only a powerful and mighty nation, but individuals of greater strength than ourselves."

Hermon is the southernmost spur of the Autilibanus range. It is "the second mountain in Syria, ranking next to the highest peak of Lebanon behind the cedars. The elevation of Hermon may be estimated at about 10,000 feet. The whole body of the mountain is limestone, similar to that which composes the main ridge of Lebanon, the central peak rises up an obtuse truncated cone, from 2000 to 3000 feet above the ridges that radiate from it, thus giving it a more commanding aspect than any other mountain in Syria. This cone is entirely naked, destitute alike of trees and vegetation. The snow never disappears from its summit" (Porter, 'Handbook, Syria and Palestine,' p. 431). At the present day it is known as <span class="accented">Jebel esh-Sheikh</span> (The Chief Mountain), also <span class="accented">Jebel eth Thel</span> (The Snow Mountain). Anciently also it had various names. By the Hebrews it was known also as <span class="accented">Sion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>, the high, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>); by the Sidonians it was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>   =  <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, a cuirass or coat of mail), probably from its shining appearance, especially when covered with snow  and by the Amorites it was called <span class="accented">Senir</span>, a word probably of the same meaning.

His vast size is indicated by the size of his bedstead, which was preserved in Rabbath-Ammon, perhaps as a trophy of some victory obtained by the Ammonites over their gigantic foe. This measured nine cubits in length, and four in breadth, "after the cubit of a man," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. according to the cubit in common use. Taking the cubit as equal to eighteen inches, the measure of the bedstead would be thirteen feet and a half by six feet. That Og even approximated to this height is incredible; if he reached nine or ten feet his height would exceed that of any one on record. It is probable, however, that he may have had his bed made vastly larger than himself, partly from ostentation, partly that he might leave a memorial that should impress upon posterity a sense of his gigantic size and resistless might; just as Alexander the Great is said (Died. Sic., 17:95) to have, on his march to India, caused couches to be made for his soldiers in their tents, each five cubits long, in order to impress the natives with an overwhelming sense of the greatness of his host. It has been suggested that it is not a bed that is here referred to, but a sarcophagus of basalt or ironstone in which, it is supposed, the corpse of Og was placed, and which was afterwards carried to Rabbath, and there <span class="accented">deposited</span> (J. D. Michaelis, Winer, Knobel, etc.). This implies that the passage is a later insertion, and not part of the original narrative as given by Moses. But with what view could such an insertion be introduced? Not to establish the credibility of the story of the victory of the Israelites over Og, for the existence of a sarcophagus in which a corpse had been placed would only attest the fact that such a one once lived and died, but would prove nothing as to how or when or where he came by his death. Not to show the vast size of the man, for a sarcophagus affords no measure whatever of the size of the person whose remains are placed in it, being an honorary monument, the size of which is proportioned to the real or supposed dignity of the person for whose honor it is made. A bed, on the contrary, which a man had used, or at least had caused to be made for himself, would afford some evidence of his size; and there is an obvious reason for Moses referring to this here, inasmuch as thereby he recalled-to the Israelites the remembrance, on the one hand, of what occasioned the fear with which they anticipated the approach of this terrible foe, and, on the other, of the grace of God to them in that he had delivered Og and all his people into their hand. It is idle to inquire how Moses could know of the existence of this bed at Rabbath; for we may be well assured that from all the peoples through whose territories he had passed reports of the strength and prowess and doings of this giant warrior would be poured into his ear.

The countries thus conquered by the Israelites were assigned by Moses to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh. The southern portion, from Aroer, in the valley of the Amen, to the Jabbok, with its towns (see <a href="../../par/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15-20, 24</a>-28), was assigned to the Reubenites and the Gadites; and the northern portion, from the Jabbok, comprehending, with Gilead, the whole of Bashan, or Argob, to the half tribe of Manasseh.

By some the clause <span class="cmt_word">all the region of Argob</span> is connected with what precedes, while others regard this clause as in apposition with what follows. Targum: "All the region of Trachona, and all that province was called the land of giants;" LXX. "And all the region of Argob, all that Bashan: the land of the Rephaim it was reckoned:" Vulgate: "The whole region of Argob, and all Bashan is called the land of giants."

The clause may be rendered thus: The <span class="accented">whole region of Argob as respects all Bashan</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in so far as it formed part of the kingdom of Bashan under Og] <span class="accented">was reputed the land of the Rephaim</span>.

As <span class="accented">Geshur</span> signifies a bridge, it has been conjectured that the Geshurites were located near some well-known bridge across the Jordan, of which, perhaps, they were the keepers, and from this took their name. Maachah is called Aram (Syria) Maachah in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>. According to the 'Ono-masticon,' it was "a city of the Amorites, by the Jordan, near Mount Hermon" (<span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;</span>). It had in later times a king, who allied himself with the Ammonites against David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>). These tribes were subdued, but not destroyed, by the Israelites; and at a later period seem to have regained their independence, and to have formed one kingdom (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-2.htm">1 Chronicles 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair</span>.

These were recaptured by the Geshurites, aided by the Arameans (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a>, "And Geshur and Aram took Chavvoth-Jair from them," etc.); at what time is unknown. From <a href="../../par/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>, it appears that Nobah, also a family descended from Machir, took certain towns, viz. "Kenath and her daughters" in this district; these, with the twenty-three Hay-voth-Jair, made up the sixty towns which "belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a>). Nobah was probably in some way subordinate to Jair, and so in this rhetorical discourse, where it is not the purpose of the author to enter on minute details, the whole of these cities are included under the name Havvoth-Jair. Unto this day. "This does not necessarily imply a long time; and Moses himself may have used this expression, though only shortly after the event, in order to give prominence to the capture of the fortified cities of the giant' king Og, by the Manassites for the encouragement of the Israelites" (Herzheimer).

Moses knew that he was not to enter the Promised Land with the people; but, reluctant to relinquish the enterprise which he had so far conducted until he should see it successfully finished, he besought the Lord that at least he might be permitted to cross the Jordan, and see the goodly land. This prayer was presented probably just before Moses asked God to set a man over the congregation to be their leader to the promised land (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-15.htm">Numbers 27:15-17</a>); for the command to give a charge to Joshua, in that office, follows immediately, as part of God's answer to Moses' request (ver. 28), and the expression "at that time" (ver. 23) points back to the charge of Moses to Joshua, as contemporaneous with the offering of his prayer. In this prayer Moses appeals to what he had already experienced of God's favor to him, in that he had begun to show him his greatness and his mighty power. The reference is to the victories already achieved over the Amorites; these were tokens of the Divine power graciously manifested to Israel, and Moses appeals to them as strengthening his plea for further favors (comp. the pleading, <a href="../../par/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>, etc.).

Moses, having presented to the people certain facts in their recent history which had in them a specially animating and encouraging tendency, proceeds to direct his discourse to the inculcation of duties and exhortations to obedience to the Divine enactments. This portion also of his address is of an introductory character as well as what precedes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation to the observance of the Law generally</span>. The Law was to be kept as a complete whole; nothing was to be taken from it or added to it; it comprised the commandments of Jehovah, and therefore they were not only to do it as what Moses, their leader and lawgiver, had enjoined, but to keep it as a sacred deposit, not to be altered or tampered with, and to observe it as what God their Sovereign had enacted for them. The dignity and worth of the Law are here asserted, and also its completeness as given by Moses. Any addition to it, no less than any subtraction from it, would mar its integrity and affect its perfection. Altered circumstances in process of time might, indeed, lead to the desuetude of some parts of the Mosaic enactments, and new institutions or laws might be required to meet a new condition of things, or even in that new condition to fence and sustain the primitive code; but that cede was to remain intact in the Statute-Book, and no alterations were to be made upon it that should affect its substance or nullify any of its principles. New laws and institutions appointed by God would, of course, have the same authority as those originally ordained by Moses; and such, it can hardly be doubted, were in point of fact under the Hebrew monarchy introduced by the prophets speaking in the name of God. The Law, nevertheless, was kept substantially entire. Even under the new dispensation, the Law has not been abolished. Christ, as he himself declared, came not to destroy the Law and the prophets, but to fulfill them (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The sin of the Pharisees, for which they were censured by our Lord, lay in this, that they taught for doctrines the commandments of men (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>), and had "made the commandments of God of none effect by their traditions" (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-6.htm">Matthew 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span>; rather <span class="accented">And now</span>. With this Moses passes from referring to what God had done for Israel to admonish Israel as to what they had to do as the subjects of God and the recipients of his favor. They were to give heed to all the statutes and judgments which Moses, as the servant of God, had taught them, in order that they might do them. <span class="cmt_word">Statutes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), the things prescribed or enacted by law, whether moral, ritual, or civil; <span class="cmt_word">judgments</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), <span class="accented">rights</span>, whether public or private, all that each could claim as his due, and all he was bound to render to God or to his fellow-men as their due. These two comprehend the whole Law as binding on Israel. On the doing of these by the people depended <span class="accented">life</span>; these had been made known to them, not merely for their information, but specifically that they might do them, and thereby have life; not long life in the Promised Land alone, though this also is included (ver. 40; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>, etc.), but that higher life, that life which man lives "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>), that spiritual life which is in God's favor (<a href="../../par/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). Enjoying this life as the fruit of obedience, they should also possess as their inheritance the laud promised to their fathers.

Thus the Queen of Sheba heard in her distant country of the wisdom of Solomon, and came to him to commune with him of all that was in her heart (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, etc.); and many throughout the ages who were seeking after truth among the heathen, were drawn to Israel by seeing how with them was the true knowledge of God. Israel was thus exalted because God was nigh to them, ready to hear their cry and to give them what they needed; which none of the gods of the nations were or could be to their votaries; and because, in the Law which God had given them, they had such instruction and direction as no heathen nation possessed.

God had then commanded the people to be gathered together, so that they stood before the Lord, were in his manifested presence, and were made to hear his voice speaking to them from amidst the fire and the clouds that covered the mount. They had thus actual evidence and guarantee that the Law they had received was Divine; and this they were to keep in mind as long as they lived, and to communicate to their children in all coming time, that so they might fear the Lord; for on this rested that covenant which God had made with Israel, and which they were to keep as the condition of their continuing to enjoy privilege and life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy soul diligently</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

They were not in this respect to imitate the heathen; for God, who had delivered them out of the furnace of Egyptian bondage, had taken them for himself to be his special possession; and therefore they were to take heed not to forget the covenant of Jehovah their God, nor to offend him by making any image or representation of him as the object of worship.

This, however, may include the far distant future, and so points to the time when Israel shall finally return to the Lord and be saved, through the acknowledgment of him whom they despised and rejected when he came as the Messiah promised to the fathers. As St. Paul grounds the assurance of the final redemption of Israel, as a whole, on their calling of God (<a href="../../par/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-29</a>), so Moses here sees in God's covenant the ground of the ever-watchful care and grace of God to Israel, and the security of their final restoration as a nation.

To instruct thee. The verb here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) means primarily to bind and thence to correct, to chasten, which meaning some interpreters would give here.

This notice, therefore, is here in its proper place in the order of the narrative. That Moses should, just at this stage, have made this appointment was fitting and proper, seeing he had been urging on the people obedience to the Divine statutes and commandments, and had represented their conquest of the territory of Sihon and Og as an earnest of their ultimate possession of the whole land of the Amorites. By appointing these cities, Moses gave an example of obedience to God's injunction, and, at the same time, not only asserted on the part of Israel a right of proprietorship in this trans-Jordanic territory, but assumed as certain that, on the ether side of Jordan also, the same right of proprietorship should be possessed and exercised by Israel in the fulfilling of the whole law concerning cities of refuge (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-1.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1</a>, etc.).

There is a slight difference in form between the phrase here and that in <a href="../../par/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>, where it is used in reference to Moses, but it is so slight (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) that no difference of meaning can be elicited. <span class="accented">God</span> spake directly to the people, as he did to Moses, only Moses was admitted to closer communion with him than the people were. This difference is sufficiently indicated in ver. 5, where the mediatory function of Moses, in the promulgation of the Law and the making of the covenant, is described as necessitated by the fear of the people, and their not going up into the mount (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>, etc.).

On these, as the basis of the covenant, the whole legislation rests, and therefore a rehearsal of them is a fitting introduction to a repetition and enforcement of the laws of the theocracy. Some differences appear between the statement of the "ten words," as given here and as given in <a href="../../par/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>. It is chiefly in the fourth commandment that these are to be found. It begins here with "remember" for "keep;" reference is made to the command of God as sanctioning the Sabbath (ver. 12), which is omitted in Exodus; a fuller description of the animals to be exempted from work on that day is given (ver. 14); the words, "that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou" are added (ver. 14); and in place of a reference to the resting of God after the Creation as the ground of the Sabbath institute, as in Exodus, there is here a reference to the deliverance of the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt as a reason why the Lord commanded them to keep the Sabbath day (ver. 15). In the fifth commandment there are two additions here-the one of the words," as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee," and the other of the words, "that it may go well with thee" (ver. 16). In the tenth commandment, the first two clauses are transposed, "desire" appears in place of "covet" in relation to "wife," and "field" is added to the specification of objects (ver. 21). These differences are of little moment. The only one demanding notice is that in the fourth commandment, where different reasons are assigned for the ordinance of the Sabbath. The two reasons assigned, however, are perfectly compatible; the one is fundamental and universally applicable, the other is subsidiary and special in its application; the one is a reason why the Sabbath was originally instituted and is for all men, the other is a reason why it was specially and formally instituted in Israel and was especially memorable to that people. In a popular address to them it seems fitting that the latter rather than the former should be the one adduced. As a memorial of their deliverance from Egypt, the Sabbath was all important to them, for by it they were constantly reminded that "they were thereby freed from the dominion of the world to be a peculiar possession of Jehovah, and so amid the toil and trouble of the world had part in the holy rest of their God" (Baumgarten). It was also fitting in a recapitulatory address that special emphasis should be laid on the fact that what the Law enunciated was what "the Lord had commanded." The addition of "field" in the tenth commandment is probably due to the fact that now, the occupation and division of the land having begun, the people were about to have, what they had not before - each his own property in land. In the tenth commandment, also, there is a difference in the two accounts worthy of notice. In Deuteronomy, "field" is added to the enumeration of objects not to be coveted, and the "wife" is put first and apart, while in Exodus the "house" precedes the "wife" and the latter ranks with the rest. In Deuteronomy also this separation of the wife is emphasized by a change of the verb: "Neither <span class="accented">shalt thou</span> desire (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span>) <span class="accented">thy neighbor's wife</span>, <span class="accented">neither shalt thou</span> covet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) <span class="accented">thy neighbor's house</span>," etc. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-16.</span> - FIRST TABLE OF THE LAW <span class="accented">praecepta pietatis</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In this, the first commandment, the great principle and basis of all true religion is asserted - monotheism, as opposed to polytheism or pantheism There is but one God, and that God is Jehovah, the self-existent and eternal, who yet has personal relations with men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-8.htm">Deuteronomy 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt not make thee <i>any</i> graven image, <i>or</i> any likeness <i>of any thing</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above, or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath, or that <i>is</i> in the waters beneath the earth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - Here the spirituality of God is asserted, and, in the prohibition of the use of images in the worship of the Deity, all idolatry is denounced, and all deification of the powers of nature in any sense is prohibited. By the Jews, this commandment was not always regarded, for they were not infrequently seduced into following the idolatrous usages of the nations around them. It does not appear, however, that, though they set up images of the idol-gods whom they were thus led to worship, they ever attempted to represent by image or picture the great God whom their fathers worshipped - Jehovah - by whom this command was given; and at a later period, when they had long renounced all idolatry, they became noted as the one nation that adored the Deity as a spirit, without any sensible representation of him: "Judaei mente sola unumque Numen intelligunt... igitur nulla simulacra urbibus suis, nedum temples  sinunt" (Tacit., 'Hist.,' 5:5). It appears that, by many of them at least, the commandment was regarded as prohibiting absolutely the graphic and plastic arts (Philo, 'Quis Rer. Div. Haer. sit.,' p. 496, edit. Mangey; ' De Ebriet.,' p. 374; ' De Gigant.,' p. 270). This may account for the low state of these arts among the Jews, and for the fact that they alone of the civilized nations of antiquity have left no monuments of art for the instruction or admiration of posterity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>.

The Sabbath was to be kept by being <span class="accented">sanctified</span>. This means that it was to be consecrated to God to be used as he had appointed. The sanctification of any object "always goes back to an act of the Divine will, to Divine election and institution. In other words, it is always a state in which the creature [or institute] is bound to God by the appointment of God himself, which is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, XXX" (Oehler, 'Theology of the Old Testament,' vol. 1. p. 155). The sanctification of the Sabbath, accordingly, was the consecration of that day to the Lord, to be observed as he had enjoined, that is, as a day of rest from all servile work and ordinary occupations. Among the Jews, those who were careful to keep this law "rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a>). Not, however, in mere indolence and idle vacancy, unworthy of a man. Not thus could the day be sanctified to the Lord. Man had to "release his soul and body from all their burdens, with all the professions and pursuits of ordinary life, only in order to gather himself together again in God with greater purity and fewer disturbing elements, and renew in him the might of his own better powers" (Ewald, 'Antiquities of Israel,' p. 102). In the Sabbath institute, therefore, lies the basis of spiritual worship and pious service in Israel.

Being about to enjoin upon the people the commandments they were to obey in the land on which they were about to enter, Moses prefaces this with a general announcement of what he was about to deliver, and with a statement of the reason for such deliverance, and of the benefits that would flow from the observance of what should be enjoined. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the commandments.</span> In the Hebrew it is, <span class="accented">This is the commandment</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sum and substance of the Divine enactment; equivalent to "the Law" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-44.htm">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>).

But the fulfillment of this promise was conditioned by their continuing as a people in the fear of God, and in obedience to his Law. Everything, then, depended on their hearing what Moses had been commanded to teach them, and observing to do it (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In the land</span>, etc. This is to be connected with the clause, "that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily;" the land was to be the scene and sphere of their prosperity and increase.

There is, indeed, no preposition before "the land" in the Hebrew; but nothing is more common in that language than for the accusative of a noun to be used adverbially to describe the place where anything is done. <span class="cmt_word">Milk and honey</span>; emblem of fruitfulness and sweetness (<a href="../../par/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>); proverbially descriptive of Canaan, as rich in pasturage for flocks, and abounding in flowers whence the bees could extract honey (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God <i>is</i> one LORD:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-25.</span> - THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT. "In the fear of Jehovah all true obedience is rooted (vers. 2, 3); for this is the first and most intimate fact in the relation of Israel and Jehovah (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). But where the supreme fear of Jehovah hinders men from allowing self to preponderate in opposition to God, there will be no stopping at this renunciation of self-will, though this comes first as the negative form of the ten commandments also shows, but there will come to be a coalescence of the human with the Divine will; and this is love, which is the proper condition of obedience, as the ten commandments also indicate (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-10.htm">Deuteronomy 5:10</a>)" (Baumgarten). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.</span> This is an affirmation not so much of the <span class="accented">moneity</span> as of the <span class="accented">unity</span> and <span class="accented">simplicity</span> of Jehovah, the alone God. Though Elohim (plu.), he is one. The speaker does not say, "Jehovah is alone God," but "Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah" (comp. for the force of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16-19</a>). Among the heathen there were many Baals and many Jupiters; and it was believed that the deity might be divided and communicated to many. But the God of Israel, Jehovah, is one, indivisible and incommunicable. He is the Absolute and the  Infinite One, who alone is to be worshipped, on whom all depend, and to whose command all must yield obedience (cf. <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). Not only to polytheism, but to pantheism, and to the conception of a localized or national deity, is this declaration of the unity of Jehovah opposed. With these words the Jews begin their daily liturgy, morning and evening; the sentence expresses the essence of their religious belief; and so familiar is it to their thought and speech that, it is said, they were often, during the persecution in Spain, betrayed to their enemies by the involuntary utterance of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - To the one indivisible Jehovah undivided devotion and love are due. Hence the injunction, <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</span> The "heart" is the inner nature of the man, including his intellectual, emotional, and cognitive futurities; the "soul" is the personality, the entire self-consciousness; and the" might" is the sum of the energies, bodily and mental. Not by profession merely is Jehovah to be loved; the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, is to be yielded to him in holy and devout affection (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The last letter Of the first word, and the last letter of the last word in this verse are larger than the ordinary size (<span class="accented">majuscula</span>), and as these two form the word for witness (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span>), the Jews say that they are written thus "that every one may know, when he professes the unity of God, that his heart ought to be intent and devoid of every other thought, because God is a <span class="accented">witness</span>, and knoweth everything" (R. Bechai, fol. 195, quoted by Michaelis, 'Bib. Heb,' in loc.).

Hence his words were to be not only in the memory of the people, but laid upon their heart (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>), that they might be ever present to the thought and will. They were also to be inculcated upon their children, and to be the subject of conversation on all fitting occasions between them, the members of their household, and even their casual associates. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Thou shalt sharpen them to thy children</span>, impress them upon them, send them into them like a sharp weapon.

The purport of this is that they were constantly and everywhere to have these commandments of the Lord in view and in mind, so as to undeviatingly observe them. It seems, however, to have been a custom widely prevalent among the ancient Eastern peoples to carry about their persons slips of parchment or some other material, on which were written sentences of moral or religious import; and such sentences they were also wont to inscribe on conspicuous places of their dwellings; usages still to be found among the Moslems (see Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' 3:364; Lane, 'Modern Egypt,' 1:358; Russell, 'Nat. Hist. of Aleppo;' Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:216), and the latter of which was not altogether unknown among Western nations (cf. Virgil, 'Georg.' lit. 26, etc.), of which traces may still be seen in Switzerland, Germany, and on old houses in both England and Scotland. This custom originated, probably, in a desire to have the sentiments inscribed always in mind; but for the most part these inscriptions came to be regarded as amulets or charms, the presence of which on the person or the house was a safeguard against evil influences, especially such as were supernatural. By the Jews this custom was followed; and they regarded it as authorized by the injunction of Moses in this passage. Taking his words literally, they had their t&ocirc;t&acirc;photh and their mezuzah, the former of which - the phylacteries of the New Testament - were strips of parchment, on which passages of the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2-10, 11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-10, 13-22</a>) were written, and these, enclosed in a box, were bound on the forehead and left wrist, and worn at prayers by the worshippers; the latter a slip of parchment, on which were written certain passages of Scripture (vers. 4-9; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>), and which, enclosed in a reed or cylinder, was fixed on the right-hand doorpost of every room in the house (see arts. 'Mezuzah' and 'Phylacteries' in Kitto's 'Biblical Cyclopedia,' 3rd edit.).

Thus, really believing in God and reverently worshipping him, the Israelites would be careful not to go after other gods, or to give to any object that homage which is due unto Jehovah alone, knowing that this he will not endure or suffer with impunity; for he is a jealous God, and them that thus dishonor him he will destroy (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, etc.). Thus also they should be kept from murmuring against God, and thereby tempting him - putting him, as it were, to the proof, and calling in question his presence and his power, as they had done at Massah (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>). Without this genuine religious principle there will be no sincere worship, no true reverence, no real obedience, rendered unto God. But where this dwells in the heart it will influence the whole life, so that the commandments of God shall be diligently kept, and that which is good and right in his sight shall be done.

The word is often rendered in the Authorized Version by new wine, and this is the meaning generally given in the lexicons. As, however, it is almost constantly joined with corn and oil, the immediate products of the soil - at least as unchanged by any process or manufacture - it is rather to be regarded as designating ripe grapes than wine.

As the grape  juice, however, was that from which wine was elicited, <span class="accented">tirosh</span> is sometimes used tropically for wine (<a href="../../par/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>), Just as corn is used for bread (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>). The <span class="accented">oil</span> here mentioned, and elsewhere joined with <span class="accented">dagan</span> and <span class="accented">tirosh</span>, is the pure fresh olive oil (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine), obtained by pressure from the berries of the olive, and used for food as well as for other purposes by the Jews (see notes on Deuteronomy 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">Flocks of thy sheep.</span> The Hebrew is very peculiar here; the same expression occurs only in this book (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4, 18, 51</a>).

Astarte ('Ash-toreth, plu. 'Ashtaroth) was the Phoenician Venus, and it is supposed that the females of the flock were called Astartes orVenuses, as propagating the flock. There is, however, another way of explaining the word as here used, by referring it to a root '<span class="accented">ashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), signifying to be multiplied, to be rich; whence the name given to the females as the multipliers of the flock, without any reference to Astarte.

He humbled them that he might test the state of their heart and affections towards him, using the distress and privations to which they were subjected as means of bringing out what was in them, and of leading them to feel their entire dependence on him for help, sustenance, and guidance. Not only by commands difficult to be obeyed laid on men, and by mighty works done in their view, does God prove men (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>); but also by afflictions and calamities (<a href="../../par/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>; 3:4; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/81-7.htm">Psalm 81:7</a>, etc.), as well as by benefits (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). Humbled so as to see his own weakness, chastised out of all self-conceit by affliction, man is brought to submit to God, to hear and obey him; and along with this the experience of God's goodness tends to draw men, in grateful acknowledgment of his mercy and bounty, to yield themselves to him and sincerely and lovingly to serve him (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - God's dealings with the Israelites were disciplinary. Both by the afflictions and privations to which they were subjected, and by the provision they received and the protection afforded to them, God sought to bring them into and keep them in a right state of mind towards him - a state of humble dependence, submissive obedience, and hopeful trust. But that this effect should be produced, it was needful that they should mark and remember all his ways towards them.

They were thus taught that their life depended wholly on God, who could, by his own creative power, without any of the ordinary means, provide for the sustaining of their life. <span class="cmt_word">And fed thee with manna</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>). It is in vain to seek to identify this with any natural product. It was something entirely new to the Israelites - a thing which neither they nor their fathers knew; truly bread from heaven, and which got from them the name of <span class="accented">manna</span> or <span class="accented">man</span>, because, in their wondering ignorance, they knew not what to call it, and so they said one to another, <span class="accented">Manhoo?</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>), <span class="accented">What is it?</span> and thenceforward called it <span class="accented">man</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That he might make thee know</span>, etc. "Bread," which the Jews regarded as "the staff of life," stands here, as in other places, for food generally; and the lesson taught the Israelites was that not in one way or by. one kind of means alone could life be sustained, but in the absence of these God could, by his own fiat, provide for the sustenance of his children. <span class="cmt_word">Every word</span> - literally, <span class="accented">all</span>, everything whatever - <span class="cmt_word">that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord</span>, i.e. all means which God has by his word provided, or by his word can provide, for the sustenance of life. So our Lord cites this passage in replying to the tempter, who had suggested that if he was the Son of God he might relieve himself from the pangs of hunger by commanding the stones which lay around to become bread. Our Lord's reply to this is virtually." I have this power, and could use it, but I will not; for this would imply impatience and distrust of God, who has engaged to sustain the life of his servants, and who can, by the mere word of his mouth, by his creative will, provide in an extraordinary way for the sustenance of life when the ordinary means of life are wanting." "Jesus means to say, ' I leave it with God to care for the sustaining of my life, and I will not arbitrarily and for selfish ends help myself by a miracle'" (De Wette, note on Matthew 4:4; see also Meyer on the place). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-4.htm">Deuteronomy 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - As the manna furnished by God's creative power saved them from hunger, so by God's providence and care their raiment was marvelously kept from decay, and they had not to go barefoot from their sandals being worn out. Waxed not old upon thee; literally, <span class="accented">d</span>i<span class="accented">d not fall away</span>, <span class="accented">waste away from upon thee</span>. This cannot mean that such was the abundant supply of raiment to the Israelites in the Arabian desert, that there was no need for them to wear garments rent and tattered from long use, as they had large flocks and herds whence a sufficient supply of wool and leather could be obtained, and there were among them skilled artificers, by whom these could be made into articles of clothing (Rosenm&uuml;ller, J. D. Michaelis, etc.). For, as Knobel observes, "This were something too insignificant beside the miraculous manna; and besides, this does not lie in the expression, which rather intimates that the clothes upon them were not worn out nor fell from them in rags, because God gave them a marvelous durability." At the same time, there is no reason to suppose that the Israelites did not make use of such supplies as were within their reach for purposes of clothing, any more than that they lived only on manna during the forty years of their wandering. Still less need we resort to such fanciful suppositions as that the garments of the Israelitish children expanded as they grew up, like the shells of snails - which is the notion of some of the Jewish rabbins, and adopted by some of the Christian Fathers (see Deyling, 'Obss. Sacc.,' II. 17. p. 247). <span class="cmt_word">Neither did thy foot swell.</span> The verb here is found in only one other passage (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>), where this passage is repeated; and the meaning is doubtful.

In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>, the shoe or sandal is specially mentioned in the same connection as here. The verb, however, cannot mean tear or torn, neither does it mean swell; the idea involved is rather that of softening, or , melting or flowing; and the meaning here seems to be, "Thy foot did not get into a bruised and wounded state" - which would have been the case had their sandals not been preserved from breaking or being worn out.

Palestine is in the present day, on the whole, well supplied with water, though the distribution is very unequal, many parts being almost wholly destitute of supply, except from what may be collected from rain in tanks or cisterns; and there is no reason to suppose it was different in the ancient times. As compared, however, with the desert to which the Israelites had been so long accustomed, and even with Egypt from which they had escaped, the country on which they were about to enter was well watered.

The principal corn crops were wheat and barley.

Were the Israelites to perish in the wilder<span class="accented">ness</span>, the Egyptians might say that God had destroyed them, either because he was unable to obtain for them the land he had promised them, or because he had ceased to regard them with favor, and had become their enemy. Neither of these could be, for were they not the people of his inheritance, and had he not showed his power already in delivering them out of Egypt? As Moses in this chapter recalls to the remembrance of Israel this and that <span class="accented">place</span>, <span class="accented">time</span>, and <span class="accented">occasion</span> of their sinning, so should each one often seriously reflect on his past life. This conduces to humility, to watchfulness, and to effort at improvement (Herxheimer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
