The discourse which now follows was the Lord's parabolic or allegoric reply to the conduct of the Pharisaic malignants. These men, claiming to be infallible guides of the ignorant, to be veritable shepherds of the flock of God, had ignored the advent of the true and good Shepherd, had opposed the Divine call and supreme claim of the Messiah, had set themselves to disturb and dislocate the relations between him and those who saw his glory and found in him the Consolation of Israel. They had excommunicated the adoring disciple who had passed out of lifelong darkness into marvelous light. They had exaggerated the faint glimmer of light which had broken upon their own blindness into true vision. They had said, "We see," and thus shown themselves to be willfully in the wrong. Their sin abode upon them. The fold of God's sheep was something different from their own expectations and definitions. Their way into it proved that they did not know its true nature. To meet this crisis our Lord delivers a triad of related and parallel pictures, which differ from the ordinary parable (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>). The parable is a picture which is complete in its elf, and invites the reader to discover some answering spiritual truth. It consists of a careful setting forth of some physical fact, some fragment of biography, some personal or domestic detail. It is true to life and experience, and embodies some ethical principle or religious emotion; and while it does not explicitly teach either, yet it suggests them to the inquiring mind. The parables of the synoptic Gospels are not exclusive or rigid in their form. The so-called parable of "the Pharisee and the publican" and that of "the good Samaritan" are at once transformable into patterns or principles of action. The element of its own interpretation is also conspicuous in that of "the rich man and Lazarus" and "the rich fool." With these latter specimens of our Lord's teaching may be compared the allegoric illustrations of the present discourse. These pictures are "transparencies" (Godet), through which the Savior's spiritual teaching pours its own illumination. They both alike differ from the "fable," a form of address in which personal characters and activities are attributed (as in the apologue of Jotham, etc.) to the irrational or even to the inanimate creation. The first of the similitudes before us has more of the character of the parable proper, because it does not at once carry its own interpretation with it. Vers. 1-6 represent in parabolic form the claims of those who aspired to provide a "door," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a sure and safe entrance to the theocratic fold. In vers. 7-10 our Lord interprets and expands the first representation by giving special significance to the words he had already used, adding something to their meaning, and contrasting his own position with that of all others. From the eleventh to the eighteenth verse he once more reverts to the original picture, and claims to occupy a relation to the sheep of God's band of far more intimate and suggestive kind than what was connoted by the <span class="accented">door</span> into the fold. He is "the good Shepherd." In that capacity he adds other and marvelous features. The parabolic or allegorical language passes away into vivid description of the leading features of his work. The parable at last glows into burning metaphor. In the first paragraph our Lord gives a parabolic picture of flock and fold, door and porter, robber and shepherd. In the second paragraph he emphasizes the relation between the <span class="accented">door</span> and the fold, claiming to be "the <span class="accented">Door</span>." In the third he illustrates the function and the responsibility of the true "Shepherd," and the relation of the shepherd to the <span class="accented">flock</span>, and he claims to be the Shepherd of Israel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The parable of the fold and flock</span>, <span class="accented">the door and the porter</span>, <span class="accented">the robber and the shepherd</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>Verily, verily</span>, betokens the deep solemnity and importance of the matter in hand, but not a complete break in the circumstances - neither a new audience nor a new theme. The adoption by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>), by Ezekiel (34.), and by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-4.htm">Zechariah 11:4-17</a>) of similar imagery to denote the contrast between the true and false shepherds, and the anticipation by the prophets of a time when the true and good Shepherd would fulfill all Jehovah's pleasure, throws vivid light on these words of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</span> Several commentators of eminence have maintained that by "the <span class="accented">door</span>," in this first verse, our Lord (as in ver. 7) meant at once to designate himself. This is not necessary. He rather summons the Pharisees to recognize the fact that there is a door, a way of sure and divinely appointed admission to the "fold of the sheep," through which the veritable Shepherd passes, bringing his flock with him by well-known voice and manner. Later on, our Lord claims to be the one Way' by which all under-shepherds can gain true access to the flock, and all the sheep of God's pasture can find protection and freedom; but here he suggests the principle of discrimination between a true shepherd and a thief or robber. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is one who is selfishly seeking his own ends, and would avoid detection; the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is one who would use violent means to secure his purpose (Judas was a "thief," Barabbas was a "robber"). The false shepherd disdains the door, and climbs up some other way along his own selfish lines of action (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used in this place only, equivalent to "from some other quarter than the ordinary home of the shepherd"). His purpose is not to benefit the sheep, but to seize them, or slaughter them for his own purposes (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). The Lord suggests that many have assumed to sustain the relation of shepherd to the flock and fold of God, with no inward call either of commission or profession. They have been eager to insist on their own rights, have mistaken their own narrow traditions for the commandments of God, have imposed upon starved and worried souls their own selfish interpretations of that commandment, and have shown that they had no legitimate access to the hearts of men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-2.htm">John 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that enters in by the door is a shepherd of the sheep</span>. Let him be who he may, Pharisee or priest, prophet or king, pastor or evangelist, unless he approach the sheep by the right "way" he demeans and condemns himself. If he come by the door into the fold, he may be so far presumably a shepherd. One fold might contain several flocks, and a shepherd might lead these flocks into different enclosures according to his wisdom and care for his sheep. Neander, Godet, and Watkins think it possible that the whole imagery may have been borrowed from the eye. The shepherds towards evening were probably gathering their scattered flocks, according to Oriental custom, into their well-known enclosures, and Jesus with his audience might have seen them doing it if they gazed out from the courts of the temple over the neighboring hills (see also Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1:301, a passage which provides an admirable commentary on this parable). There is no absolute need that the customary and well-known habit of the country-side should have been visible at the moment. The abundantly attested practice furnished to his hearers all needful corroboration. The deeper significance of the passage lies in the prophetic symbolism of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. Jehovah was the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), and he would appoint once more in their Messiah-King a David, who should be his gracious Representative and Agent. All these representations were gathered up in Christ's wonderful parable of the lost sheep (<a href="../../par/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a>). Thoma endeavors to credit the author of the Gospel with this ideal picture of the contrast between the true and false shepherd. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him the porter openeth</span>. The doorkeeper of the fold has been variously interpreted. Bengel and Hengstenberg say, "God himself" is meant; Stier, Alford, and Lange, "the Holy Spirit;" against which interpretations may be urged the subordinate position assigned to the "porter," as compared with the shepherds themselves. Lampe and Godet think that "John the Baptist" was intended; while Meyer and De Wette say that it is one of those elements of the parable which is dropped out of our Lord's own exposition for which we need not seek any special application. Westcott thinks it must vary with the special sense attributed to "sheep" and "shepherd," and float we must think of it as "the Spirit working through his appointed ministers in each case." The "doorkeeper," if Christ be himself the "Door," is the keeper of that door - the agency, the ministry, the ordinances by which the excellences and power of Christ were or are manifested. We are reminded of subsequent use of the imagery in Paul's Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>); but the full meaning of the phrase is only suggested, and we had better wait for Christ's interpretation of some parts of this allegory. The context provides a specific filling out, first of one part of the imagery, and secondly of another part of it. The two interpretations are not to be forced at one and the same time upon the parable. Our Lord continues: <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep hear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">voice</span>. When a shepherd approaches the door to fetch the folded sheep which belong to him, the porter opens that door for him <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a true shepherd who has at heart the interests of the sheep and of their supreme Owner, finds the way made ready for him. In the fold are many flocks. All the sheep give heed to his voice. <span class="cmt_word">He calleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</span> They know a shepherd calls, and then that shepherd addresses his own sheep by name, and he leads these forth into the pasture. Even in our own pastures the shepherds know each sheep by name. Aristotle ('Hist. Anim.,' 6:19) tells us the bell-wether knew his name, and obeyed his shepherd. Archdeacon Watkins gives a quotation from Theocritus' 'Idylls,' charmingly illustrating the habit. The shepherd, by the mere call to his own sheep, would separate them from these which did not belong to him, and lead them forth to their pasture in the wilderness. This method of Oriental life illustrates the function of all true shepherds of men. It has had many partial fulfillments in the history of the Church and of the world. Daring the period of the old theocratic dispensation, many "thieves and robbers" made havoc of the flock; still there were prophetic and kingly men who, sent by God, found their way to the heart of Israel; many came to know that a prophet had been among them, and they followed him. It is equally true now, though all the external conditions are changed. The full application of this part of the allegory is only seen when "the good Shepherd" seeketh his sheep; but the meaning of the first picture is obscured by hurrying on to the enlarged and double exposition which Christ gave of the two parts of his own parable, and much is lost by endeavoring to force into a primary exposition of vers. 1-6 the features borrowed from a twofold interpretation of the separate ideas suggested by the composite image. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In like manner, our Lord continues to describe what every true shepherd of men has done and ever will do: <span class="cmt_word">When he hath put forth all</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own</span>, and not another's, drawn them by the music of his voice, or constrained them by the sweet violence of his love, or even compelled them to go forth from a fold in which they may find security, but not pasture; and when he has marshaled them into obedience and into thankful trust by the strength of his sympathy and knowledge of their need, <span class="cmt_word">he goeth before them.</span> He is their leader and example; he shows them in his own life the kind of provision made for them; he shares with them the perils of the wilderness, and first of all is prepared to grapple with their fierce foes, "He drinks of the brook in the way." The highest meaning, the only complete interpretation, of this passage is found when Christ himself is the Shepherd, who does summon from the old enclosure "all his own," all who have entered into living harmony with himself. <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span> Nothing is here said of "lost sheep" or of "goats;" these are all the "ideal sheep" of the flock, individuals who recognize the voice of the true Leader, and discriminate their own shepherd from all others, whether pretenders to their affections or destroyers of their lives  - wolves or butchers, thieves or robbers. Should we persist in interpreting the apologue as it stands, a question arises about the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that are not the shepherd's" own." Some have answered it by supposing that the latter are the chief of his own flock, who will bring the rest after them. The truth is not obscurely hinted of that election to highest privileges and duties, which does not declare that the rest are not sheep at all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-5.htm">John 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But a stranger will they by no means follow, for they know not the voice of strangers.</span> The negative is strongly expressed. The sheep, who know their shepherd's voice, will not take the lead of a stranger or an alien; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of a "thief or robber." If these secure the sheep at all, it is by violence or stealth, by unfair means, by illegitimate methods. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-6.htm">John 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This parable spake Jesus unto them</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in this place and in <a href="../../par/john/16-25.htm">John 16:25-29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>. It is the LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> proverb, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>, a similitude or didactic saying. The Greek word means any speech (<span class="accented">ethos</span>) deviating (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) from the common way (Lange). It may deviate by its sententious or parabolical form, which conceals under a closed metaphor a variety of meanings. <span class="cmt_word">But they,</span> the Pharisees, who were confident of their own position, and gloried in their influence over men, and whose moral nature was steeled and armed to resist even a possible reference to themselves as "thieves," or "robbers," or "aliens," and who would not admit any of Christ's claims to their own disparagement, <span class="cmt_word">understood not what things they were which he was saying to them.</span> The blind man had heard Ms voice, obeyed, found healing, advanced step by step from a bare knowledge of "a man Jesus" to a confession of him as one empowered by God; to a belief that he was a "Prophet," able to relax Mosaic Law; and finally to a ready acknowledgment that he was the Son of God. The Pharisees were conscious of neither need, nor blindness, nor desire of salvation, nor of the Shepherd's care or grace. They will not go to him for life. They can make nothing of his enigmatic words. They take counsel against him. Their misconception contrasts strongly with the susceptibility of the broken-hearted penitents. So far the parable or proverb corresponds with the parables of the kingdom in the synoptic Gospels, and is open to many interpretations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-7.htm">John 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Allegory of the door and the fold</span>, <span class="accented">in which Christ claims to be</span> "the <span class="accented">Door of the sheep</span>." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, with its resumptive force, introduces the effect upon Christ of the unsusceptible character of the Pharisees). Some pause may have occurred, during which these men displayed their bitter feeling and utter lack of appreciation, and he proceeds first to give them an explanation of the words, which should leave them in no doubt as to <span class="accented">one</span> emphatic meaning which they contained; <span class="cmt_word">Said</span> <span class="cmt_word">again unto them, I am the Door of the sheep,</span> This exposition of the allegory is introduced by the solemn <span class="cmt_word">Amen, amen</span>. Christ first calls attention to the "door" into the sacred fellowship of men with God. On a subsequent occasion (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), he said, "I am the Way" to the Father; "no man cometh unto the Father, but by <span class="accented">me</span>." The parable as it stands refers to true and false teachers of the people, and to just and unjust claims to confer upon the sheep of God's pasture safe and sure access to God, and all privileges of Divine life. In interpreting it, he declares first that he is the one <span class="accented">Door</span>, not of "the fold" so much as <span class="accented">of the sheep</span>, in their individual capacity. This corresponds with every claim made by him and made in his Name, that he, in all the fullness of his Personality, had always been the one Medium by which, in the theocracy or beyond it, men have drawn near to the Father. The Logos is the Angel of the covenant, the Rock in the wilderness, the great High Priest, the Veil over the holy place, the propitiatory Sacrifice, the Prophet, the King. He it is who ever and always has given consolation and peace to his people. He is the one method, agency, reality, by which not only the shepherds, but the sheep, enter into the fold, and go forth thence to pasture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that came before me</span> <span class="cmt_word">are thieves and robbers</span>. Great difficulty has been felt by commentators in understanding "before me." The words clearly gave the early Gnostic heretics a text on which they established their dualistic rejection of the old dispensation. Their absence from certain texts led Augustine and others to emphasize the word "came." "All who <span class="accented">came</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in their own strength or wisdom, when not "<span class="accented">sent"</span> or authorized by God. Other endeavors have been made (see Meyer and Lunge) to give it a non-temporal meaning, such as <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, "independently of <span class="accented">me</span>." Wolf and Olshausen make <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>, "<span class="accented">in</span> the place" or "in the stead of me" (so Lunge, Lampe, Schleusner). De Wette and others accept the temporal meaning, "before," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in point of time, and include under it the entire <span class="accented">corpus</span> of Old Testament saints and teachers, and therefore regard the saying as inconsistent with the gentleness of Christ. But with <a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 45-47</a>, and many other passages in this Gospel, it is certain the words could not mean to denounce all who came as teachers or shepherds before him in mere <span class="accented">point of time</span> as "thieves and robbers," whom the sheep did not hear. Therefore the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> must be to some extent modified in meaning. We agree with Westcott and Godet in limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, by throwing the emphasis on the "came," and by adding, moreover, to it the essential point, "came making themselves doors of the sheep" - claiming to have the "key of knowledge," professing vainly to open or shut the door of heaven. That is, no other has ever had the right or claim to be such "a door." The Baptist, the prophets, one by one, Abraham and Moses, in their day made no such profession. The dignity belongs to Christ alone. The language may receive accentuation from the pressing urgency of false Christs, as well as the hopeless system of Pharisaic pride. Theme sees here the mere dressing out of St. Paul's language, condemnatory of false prophets and ravening wolves who would not spare the flock of Christ (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>), and Christ's own words in the synoptists (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, etc.). Special reference is made to the ceremonial superstitions, to "the hedge about the Law," to the cruel slavery of modern Pharisaism, which had done what neither prophets nor priests of old had attempted. Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the present tense, "<span class="accented">are</span> thieves," etc., making Christ's reference obvious to the lawyers and scribes of his own day, who were closing the door, and plundering those whom they kept out of the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">But the sheep did not hear them</span>. The true sheep have not been seduced by them. The teaching of these Pharisees has not prevailed over susceptible souls. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the Door: by me</span> - by living relation to me - <span class="cmt_word">if any man</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either shepherd or sheep, for in this part of the interpretation they are not distinguished, and they alike need "salvation" and "pasture." <span class="cmt_word">By me if any man enter, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span> "Salvation" here spoken of refers primarily to deliverance from dangers, protection from the ravenous wolves without the fold, and from false shepherds within. "Go in and out" is a phrase frequently used "to denote the free use of an abode by one who is at home in the house" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21</a>). The believer who enters into fellowship with God, and is "saved," does not "go in and out" of that state, but can as a child share by turns the Divine repose of the home, and the high privilege of his sonship in the world. "He claims his share in the inheritance of the world, secure of his home" (Westcott). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <i>it</i> more abundantly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy.</span> Christ, elaborating, evolving, what is contained in the image of "thief," regards his rival as the thief of souls; he whose pretension to be a way to God is based on no inward and eternal reality, who comes for no other purpose than to make the sheep his own, not to give them pasture; to sacrifice them to his selfish ends, to use them for his own purposes, not to deal with them graciously for theirs; but to destroy, since in the pursuit of his selfish ends he wastes both life and pasture. A terrible impeachment, this of all who have not recognized the true Door into the sheepfold, who would shut up the way of life that they may exalt their own order, would diminish the chances of souls in order to secure their own position. This forms the transition to the second interpretation of the parabolic words; for he adds, <span class="cmt_word">I came that they might have life, and that they might have it abundantly</span>; more even than they can possibly use. This is one of the grandest of our Lord's claims. He gives like God from overflowing stores (<a href="../../par/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>). Those who receive life from him have within them perennial sources of life for others - fullness of being (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). One of the differentiae of "life" is "abundance" of supply beyond immediate possibility of use. Life has the future in its arms. Life propagates new life. Life has untold capacities about it - beauty, fragrance, strength, growth, variety, reproduction, resistance to death, continuity, eternity. In the Logos is <span class="accented">life -</span> and Christ came to give it, to communicate "life to the non-living, to the dead in trespasses, and to those in their graves" (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-21.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The functions and responsibilities of the veritable Shepherd</span>, <span class="accented">and the relation of the Shepherd to the flock</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. The word here rendered "good" means more than the "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) or the" veritable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); more than <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good, in the sense of being morally excellent and inwardly fulfilling God's purpose that the sheep should be shepherded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a "goodness" that is conspicuous, that shows and approves itself to the experience and observation of all. Thus the Lord fills up the meaning of the first parable by emphasizing another element in it. There may be many shepherds worthy of the name, but he alone justifies the designation (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>.). This imagery has inwrought itself into Christian literature and art. The earliest representations of Christ in the catacombs depict him as "the good Shepherd" (Tertullian, 'De Fuga.,' c. 11; Hermas, 'Sire.,' 6:2); the earliest hymns and latest minstrelsy of the Church dwell fondly on the image which portrays his individual watchfulness, his tender care, his self-sacrificing love. <span class="cmt_word">The good Shepherd layeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">down his life for the sheep</span>; not only does his work with his life in his hand, but he deliberately lays down his life and consciously divests himself of his life, and is doing it now. The Shepherd dies that the sheep may live (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). Elsewhere Jesus says, "The Son of man gives his life a ransom for many" (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>). The thought is very grand, and is a strange addition to the claim to be the Shepherd of Israel, and gives intense pathos to the language of our Lord to Simon Peter (<a href="../../par/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>), "Shepherd my sheep." The further development of the parable shows that in the metaphor he regards his death as no disastrous termination of the Shepherd's function, but as an event in his career. Hence it is not just of Reuse ('Theol. Chretien,' 2.) to contend that our Lord does not here suggest a vicarious or propitiatory death on his part. This is a veritable death, which secures the life of the sheep, and does not arrest the Shepherd's care (see vers. 17, 18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>). The hireling is contrasted with the shepherd. The protector of a flock, who, though, not a thief, or robber, or alien, yet has no unselfish regard for the sheep, is guilty of cowardice, and his shameless flight from danger may do as much harm to the flock as the thief or robber. Godet would, at all events at first, limit the reference to the priestly party, who ought to have had more courage and real care for the sheep, but were utterly unable to bear the brunt of assault from Sanhedrin and Pharisees. The latter represent, as he thinks, the ravening "wolf." But surely all who have merely mercenary or selfish motives in their treatment of souls, and who flee at the approach of danger or death, are here held up to grievous condemnation. All who proclaim themselves to be "the door of the sheep," who, independently of Christ, and without the animating breath of the Divine Spirit, are considering themselves rather than the flock which they profess to instruct and protect, are the hirelings here denounced. In the hour of real peril they turn and flee. "Whose own the sheep are not." They do not seek the destruction of the flock which is not theirs, but they neglect and forsake when they should be faithful unto death. They have not identified themselves with the object of their professed care. The <span class="accented">wolf</span> is the deadly power over seeking the destruction of the soul, and even compassing it; it is the metaphor for every sort of power opposed to Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-3.htm">Luke 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth</span> (them). "The seizing and scattering" shows how these hostile powers not only devastate, but destroy; not only crush individuals, but ruin Churches. The sheep do not belong to a hireling, as they do to a shepherd. No living bond of common interest links them to each other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-13.htm">John 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - (<span class="cmt_word">The hireling</span> <span class="cmt_word">fleeth) because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep</span>. He only cares for himself. He is no match for the wolf of temptation, or disease, or death, lie wants to reap the personal advantage of his temporary office, and, if his own interests are imperiled, he can leave them to any other hireling, or to the wolf. Melancholy picture this of much deserted duty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">I am the good shepherd, and know my <i>sheep</i>, and am known of mine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The Lord resumes: <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. He now makes his discourse more explicit. He almost drops the allegory, and merely adopts the sacred metaphor. His self-revelation becomes more full of promise and suggestion for all time. He takes up one of the characteristics of the shepherd which discriminated him from "hireling," "thief," or "robber." <span class="cmt_word">And I know mine own, and my</span> <span class="cmt_word">own know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father.</span> This more accurate text, translation, and punctuation of the Revised Version brings into living comparison the mutual knowledge of Christ and his own sheep, with the mutual knowledge of Christ and the Father. Christ's personal knowledge of his people is that which comes into their religious consciousness. They know his knowledge of them. They know him to be what he is - to be their Lord God, as they realize his personal recognition and care. The one involves the other (see <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). The particle of transition is more than a mere illustration (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> is more than <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> introduces not infrequently an explanation, sometimes a causal consideration, or an illustration which accounts for the previous statement; see <a href="../../par/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23</a>). The knowledge which the sheep have of the Shepherd corresponds with the Son's knowledge of the Father, and the Shepherd's knowledge of the sheep answers to the Father's knowledge of the Son; but more than this, the relation of the Son to the Father, thus expressed, is the real ground of the Divine intimacies between the sheep and the Shepherd (cf. <a href="../../par/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>). Then the Lord repeats and renews the solemn statement made at the commencement of the sentence, And I lay down my life for the sheep. Such knowledge of the peril of "his  own" involves him in sacrifice. Whereas in ver. 11 this is attributed to the "good Shepherd," now he drops the first part of the figure, and says, "I am laying down my life."

"Other sheep I have." Though they have never as yet heard his voice, they are his. His relation with them is personal and direct and spiritual, not dictated or conditioned by "the fold." They will hear his voice. We in vain ask the question, "When?" He alone can answer it. Many a Cornelius in every nation is accepted by him (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). But the passage contemplates a wider application: "Them also I must bring, or lead, among my own." They are scattered abroad now, but eternal Love, by assuming Shepherd-wise relations with them, determines not to bring them to one place or enclosure - to express such a thought we should have had, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>) or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Westcott) - but to bring them into personal relations with himself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall become one flock, one Shepherd</span>. The false English translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, viz. "fold," should be specially noticed. If our Lord had meant to convey the idea of the rigid enclosure into which all the scattered sheep should be gathered, he would have used the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is, however, studiously chosen. The error has done grievous injury. There is no variation of the Greek text, or in the earliest versions. It came through the Vulgate <span class="accented">ovile</span> into Wickliffe's Version, and into many other European versions. The Old Latin Versions were correct, but Jerome led the way into the inaccurate translation. Tyndale perceived its true meaning, and Luther beautifully preserved the play upon the words. Coverdale, in his own Bible (1535), followed Tyndale; but in 1539, "the Great Bible" followed the Vulgate (Westcott). When naturalized, it sustained the false and growing pretension that outside the one "fold" of the visible Church the good Shepherd was not ready with his care and <span class="accented">love</span> (see for the only adequate translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where the Authorized Version has correctly rendered it "flock"). Christ, on other occasions, carefully warned his disciples against such narrowness, and here he declares that the sheep, independently of the fold or folds, may yet form one great <span class="accented">flock</span>, under <span class="accented">one Shepherd</span>. When he described himself as the <span class="accented">Door</span>, he was, as we have seen, careful to speak of himself as "Door of the <span class="accented">sheep</span>," and not as the Door into the <span class="accented">fold</span>. He laid down his life in order to break down the partition between Jew and Gentile (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>), between God and man, and between man and man. "In Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female, bond nor free." There may be many folds. Different nations, ages, times, and seasons may cause variations in these; but there is but one flock under the watchful guardianship of one Shepherd.

The "I" and "me" refer to the incarnate Son, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Divine-human Personality of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father loveth me, <span class="accented">because</span>, not merely <span class="accented">that I lay down my life</span>, for such might be the consequence of helplessness in the presence of victorious and desperate foes. The love which merely "laid down life" would be a Buddha-like self-sacrifice, producing certain moral effects upon the minds of the onlookers, and revealing a large and loving sense of the need of others. Yet in such expression of his sacrificial love he would have relinquished his undertaking. There would have been no more that he could do for his flock, this Shepherd-functions would, in the consummating act, cease, he would be a beautiful Memory, not a living Energy; a glorious Example, not the Author of eternal salvation. He would cease to be the great Shepherd of the sheep. Now the Father's love contemplated more than this, viz. the Lord's own purpose to <span class="accented">take up again that life</span> which he was prepared voluntarily to lay down for the sheep. Thus he would indeed die, that he might be more of a Shepherd to them than he had ever been before. How otherwise would he personally bring the other sheep into his flock, or be known of them, as the Father was known by him? Christ declares that after his death he would still exercise royal rights, be as much a Divine-human Personality as ever. Christ, as a sinless Man, the sinless One, <span class="accented">might</span> indeed, after the victory over the tempter in the wilderness, or from the Mount of Transfiguration, have returned to the spiritual world without accomplishing an exodus on Golgotha, but he chose, he willed, to lay down his life. Having done this much, he might have joined the great majority, and been their Head and Chief, and left his work to be commented on by others. But such a consummation would have fallen far short of the true and sufficing object of the Father's <span class="accented">love</span>. Christ declares that the very end of his death was his resurrection from death. In retaking his life, he is able to continue, on perfectly different terms, the shepherding of his people he becomes in the highest sense, the great Shepherd, the good Shepherd, the archetypal, and the veritable Shepherd of the flock of God.

I am <span class="accented">laying it down</span>, not in consequence of my impotence before the powers of darkness, but "from myself." This proceeding is in perfect harmony with the will of God the Father; but it is Christ's free act notwithstanding, and of all things the most worthy of the Father's love (cf. here <a href="../../par/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, which appears at first to be in contradiction with the statement of this verse; but the closing words of the verse rectify the impression; see also <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). Christ justifies his extraordinary claim to lay down and after his death (retaining then the full possession of his Personality), to reassume the life which for a while, in submission to the doom on human nature, he had resolved to sacrifice, he says, I have (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">right</span> - or, <span class="accented">power</span> and <span class="accented">authority</span> combined - <span class="cmt_word">to lay it down, and right to take it again.

The Divine purpose was realized in his perfect freedom and his perfect and absolute fulfillment of the Father's will. The narrative of the agony in the garden, given by the synoptists, confirms the blending of his own freedom with the Divine order; but the language of this Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>), and Matthew 19:11), and the best researches into what is called "the physical cause of the death of Christ" (see Dr. Stroud's valuable work on that subject), all confirm the voluntary nature of our Lord's suffering and death. "To cover this incomparable privilege with a veil of humility, he thought good to call it a command. The Father's mandate was, Thou shalt die or not die, thou shalt rise again or <span class="accented">not</span> rise again, according to the free promptings of thy love" (Godet). It was, however, the Father's appointment that Christ should freely exercise this stupendous consequence of his perfect obedience. So that all the assurances that God raised him from the dead are confirmed by the mode in which he speaks of his Divine right.

The paragraph is pregnant with meaning, arising from the place, the time, and the action of the Jews. It contains the discrimination between the Jews and those who were in spiritual union with himself, viz. his sheep. Then follow the characteristics and privileges of his sheep, which lead up to the climax in which he risks the deadly animosity of his hearers, by claiming identity of saving power with the Father. tic accounts for this by asserting what is expressive of positive consubstantiality with the Father. On any exegesis, this solemn announcement is a stupendous assumption of personal dignity, and was regarded by his hearers as blasphemous madness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, <span class="cmt_word">the Feast of Dedication</span> (the <span class="accented">enkainia</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was</span> (celebrated) <span class="cmt_word">in Jerusalem</span>. This feast is not elsewhere noticed in the New Testament. The account of its origin is found in 1 Macc. 4:36, etc.; 2 Macc. 10:1 - 8; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:07. 7. <span class="cmt_word">And it was winter</span>. It was held on the 25th of Chisleu, which, in A.D. , would correspond with the 19th of December, in commemoration of the "renewal," reconsecration, of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus after the gross profanation of it by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Macc. 1:20-60 1 Macc. 4:36-57). It occupied eight days, was distinguished by illumination of the city and temple and of other places throughout the land, and hence was called the "Feast of Lights." Many interesting peculiarities of this feast are detailed in Edersheim's 'Life of Jesus,' 2:228, etc. One feature was the increase night by night of the number of lights which commemorated the restoration of the temple. All fasting and public mourning were prohibited (see 'Moed. K.,' 3:9). The high enthusiasm of the people made them long for deliverance from the Roman yoke. The Jews would probably have eagerly accepted Jesus as Messiah if he had been ready to take up the <span class="accented">role</span> of a political leader. Doubtless he was the Christ of the Hebrew prophecies, and in his own human consciousness his high position swelled his loftiest thought; but he was not the Christ of their Jewish expectation.

It was associated with the grandest events in their national history; for it was reared on the substructions of Solomon's temple, which even to the present day are intact (Robinson's 'Palestine,' 1:289; Palestine Exploration Society's Reports; 'Recovery of Jerusalem,' frontispiece, pp. 17, 226, 309-319). The Lord walked there because it was winter, and wintry weather. This reveals a little touch of the hand of an eye-witness. We need not ask for any more transcendental explanation. The note of time, moreover, implies that two months had elapsed since the Feast of Tabernacles. Wieseler calculates that the Feast of Tabernacles closed on October 19, and the Feast of Dedication began on December 20, and, if so, time is left for a portion of the Galilaean ministry cited in <a href="../../par/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>. - 13. <a href="../../par/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9-13</a> shows that the time referred to was after a period of heavy rain, and may account for Jesus walking in the shelter of the portico.

They had heard his parables, and say, "Let him drop all reserve, and deliver himself in categoric form." Archdeacon Watkins has well recalled the various utterances which fell on the more susceptible of the Jerusalemites. This was the Feast of Lights, and has he not called himself the Light of the world? This was a feast commemorative of freedom from the Syrian yoke, and had he not said, "If the Son set you free, ye shall be free indeed"? ' This was the Feast of the Purification of the Temple; had not his first act been a cleansing of the courts of the temple? We cannot wonder at the summons and challenge of the people.

Meyer, however, translates this differently; he supposes the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the Father "a something greater, a greater potence." Westcott and Hort prefer the reading with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; and Westcott translates, <span class="accented">That which my Father has given me is greater than all</span>, and regards it as a reference to the sheep as a collective unity. The internal reasons compel Luthardt, Godet, and Lange to fall back on T.R., and surely the extraordinary strain of the meaning justifies them. Our Lord would sustain with even stronger assurance the safety of his sheep. The Father's gift to himself, the Father's own eternal love and power, the Divine omnipotence of the Lord God himself, is pledged to their security. "My hand" becomes "my Father's hand." He seems to say, "If you question my capacity, you need not question his power. Sacrilegious violence may apparently nail my hands to the cross; the sword may awake against Jehovah's Shepherd. But none can outwit, surprise, crucify, conquer, my Father, none can invalidate his care."

As Augustine and Bengel have said, the first clause is incompatible with Sabellianism, and the second clause with Arianism. The Lord is conscious of his own Personality as distinct from that of the Father, and yet he asserts a fundamental unity. But what kind of unity is it? Is it a unity of wish, emotion, sentiment, only? On the contrary, it is a oneness of redemptive power. The Divine activity of the Father's eternal love did not come to any arrest or pause when he gave the sheep to the Son, but with its irresistible might is present in the "hand" of Jesus (<span class="accented">no one</span> "can," not no one "shall"). Therefore the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, the one reality, if it does not express actual unity of essence, involves it. Some have endeavored to minimize the force of this remarkable statement by comparing it with <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>, where Jesus said believers are "to be in us," and "to be one, even as we are one," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to have the same kind of relation with one another (being a collective unity) as the Father and Son sustain towards each other, "I in them, thou in me, that they may be perfected [reach their <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by being blended] into one;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. into one Divine personality by my indwelling. Now, it is nowhere there said that believers and the Father are one, but such a statement is scrupulously avoided. Numerous attempts have been made to escape from the stupendous assumption of this unity of power and essence with the Father. The whole gist of the assertion reveals the most overwhelming self-consciousness. The Lord declares that he can bestow eternal life and blessedness upon those who stand in close living relation with himself, and between whom and himself there is mutual recognition and the interchanges of love and trust. He bases the claim on the fact that the Father's hands are behind his, and that the Father's eternal power and Godhead sustain his mediatorial functions and, more than all, that the Father's Personality and his own Personality are merged in one essence and entity. If be merely meant to imply moral and spiritual union with the Father, or completeness of revelation of the Divine mind, why should the utterance have provoked such fierce resentment?

The Jews felt the force of this indignant reproach, and would not admit that his Divine and goodly work was without meaning to them. It was, however, a melancholy reality that his beneficent work had roused their malice into fiercer activity, but they credit themselves with a higher and a doctrinal motive and with a jealousy for the honor of God. They charge him with blasphemy, and the charge is reiterated before Pilate (<a href="../../par/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>). The Jews were in one sense right. He had declared his essential unity with the Father; he had "made himself, represented himself (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-53.htm">John 8:53</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>), as equal with God."

"Good works" by the score were no vindication of one who dishonored the Name of God by claiming equality with him.

To stand in close relation with the theocracy was to be covered with its glory. He seems to force upon them thus a host of similar blendings of the Divine and human in the age-long preparation for himself, and to free all these from the suspicion of blasphemy. The Hebrew thought was really calculated to prepare the world for this high intercommunion, not to abolish it. Judaism, rabbinism, had widened the chasm between God and man. Christ came to fill up the chasm; nay more, to show the Divine and human in living, indissoluble union.

A fine testimony to the confidence which our Lord exercised in the Holy Scripture. He was accustomed to educe principles of life from its inward structure, from its concealed framework, from its underlying verities. The very method adopted by Jesus on this occasion revealed the fact that both he and his biographer were born Jews. These tyrannical judges were "to die like men," yet, since "the Word of God came to them," there was a sense in which even they, without blasphemous assumptions, might receive the title of <span class="accented">elohim</span>.

He was destined, or designated, or appointed, and then sent to do this sublime deed of redemption. Unlike those to whom the eternal Logos came, conferring thereby honorific titles, and calling them to occasional and alas! His discharged duties, he was the eternal Word himself, and he was moreover (as those old judges (lid) "to die like men," to lay down that life in order that he might take it again; consequently, he asks, with sublime self-consciousness, "Say ye of him, thus consecrated, <span class="cmt_word">Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am Son of God</span>?" It is remarkable that Christ should, instead of repeating the phrase, "I and the Father are one" - <span class="accented">one</span> as we have seen, in power and purpose and attribute - imply that in that former saying he had but told them he was "Son of God," in a sense to which the old Hebrew kings, notwithstanding their theocratic symbolism and mysterious names of honor, could not aspire. This is clearly a bold utterance of the Messianic dignity (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 20</a>). The fact that he continually treated the two ideas of Father and Son as correlative (<a href="../../par/john/8-19.htm">John 8:19</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-35.htm">John 9:35-37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-7.htm">John 14:7-13</a>, etc.) makes the one assertion an equivalent of the other. This is a much greater claim than that yielded to the judges of old, and it is a new revelation of the Father and of the Son. Moreover, he showed them that there were many anticipations, foreshadowings of the incarnation of God in their own Scripture. We have an argument from the less to the greater, but one which, while it technically freed him from the charges of blasphemy, revealed the age-long preparation that had been made for the union between the Infinite and finite, between the Creator and creature, between the Father and his child, which was effected in himself. Some may have supposed that in the leveling up of the theocratic adumbrations of the Incarnation, he was virtually relinquishing the uniqueness of his own; but the following words, and the interpretation put on them by his hearers, answer such a charge. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37</a></div><div class="verse">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - "I and the Father are one," and "I am the Son of God." These two mighty utterances are equivalent to the following: "I do the works of my Father." My works are his works, his works are mine. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." The recognition of the Divine is a sign of the regenerated mind, and a test of fitness for a place in Christ's flock (cf. "I know my sheep, and my sheep know me"). The Jews had not recognized the true reciprocal relation between the Father and Son. He had come out from God, and been sent from the Father to produce this impression, to make known the Father by his Sonship; and he had taken steps to convince even unbelieving men of the identity of his nature and Spirit with that of the Father. He is content to rest his claims upon their belief, on the character of his works. He is content to leave the question as to whether he be a blasphemer or one with the Father, a sinner of sinners or Son of God, on the evidence of his works - on the God-like, Father-like character of his entire ministry (cf. ver. 32; <a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> "If the evidence be insufficient, I acquit you of blame in not taking me at my word. My own words and Person and life <span class="accented">might</span> be enough for you; but if my works are not in perfect harmony with the best you know of the Father, believe me not." Christ's appeal to the reason of his hearers, to the sufficiency of the evidence he had given, would justify unbelief in case of a proved failure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a></div><div class="verse">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father <i>is</i> in me, and I in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if I do</span> - if I am performing the works of my Father, if these acts of healing and helping, of mighty consolation and symbolic grace, are obviously such as you can recognize as the Father's, believe them; learn that much, - it is for your life - and if you make that acquisition, <span class="cmt_word">though ye believe not me</span> - though you do not credit my assertion on my own authority, though you do not take me at once on my own word - <span class="cmt_word">believe the works; you may</span> then take the further step, and both <span class="cmt_word">know and understand</span>, or know broadly and completely, and then learn in details, <span class="cmt_word">that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</span> Between the assertion of ver. 30, "I and my Father are one," and that of this verse, "the works" are introduced - works that are recognized as Divine, "the Father's," but seen and known also to be Christ's own works. Why should they stone him for blasphemy if they have evidence so resistless as this, even if it comes short of proof, that he is absolutely one with the Father? The intuitive perception of the Divine in Christ is the highest and noblest spiritual experience. His word should be, might be, enough; but, suppose it should fail, miracles, "works," come in to link the Divine Personality of the Speaker with the supreme Father. The works may teach them that he is in the Father, and the Father in him. Not by a flash of light, but by growing intellectual conviction, they must come to a conclusion which the great assertion," I and the Father are one," finally confirms.

They stretched out hands which dropped harmlessly at their side - another confirmation of the solemn statement of ver. 18. There is no need to suppose a miracle, still less to justify the preposterous notion that the body of Jesus was, in John's Gospel, docetic merely (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-18.htm">Mark 11:18</a>).

There he submitted to baptism, to fasting, and temptation. There he had heard the first testimonies of John. There he had gathered round him his most susceptible and appreciative hearers. There Andrew and Simon, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, came under his mighty spell. There the first intuition of his Messiahship dawned on the noblest of his followers. The entire suggestion, is unquestionably historic. That special scene of our Lord's ministry was indelibly impressed on the memory of the beloved disciple. <span class="accented">The place where John at first baptized</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the place occupied by John before he came to OEnon, and therefore in the district where he delivered his most solemn testimonies to the people, to the Sanhedrin, to the first disciples. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">there he abode</span>. How long, we know not. The repose was soon broken.

It was not John's function to work miracles or startle the world with visible proofs of his Divine commission. John stood on the natural sphere, found a place in contemporaneous history, and exerted all his influence by the force of his prophetic word. But as a remarkable confirmation of the whole revelation enacted by the life and deeds of Christ, we read, <span class="cmt_word">But all things that John spake of this Man were true.</span> The testimonies of John were to the effect that Jesus was "mightier" than he - that he was the Son of God, the "Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and with fire," and "<span class="accented">the</span> Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." The absence of the miraculous nimbus from the record of John's ministry is one of the subsidiary evidences we possess of the supernatural power wielded by our Lord Jesus Christ. John was a historic contemporary of Jesus, whose following survived for some centuries, but not until comparatively recent times did credulity or the mythopceic tendency clothe him in a supernatural glory. He was believed to be the Elijah of the new covenant, but he was not supposed to have gone to heaven, like his prototype. A rumor grew up that Jesus was John raised from the dead, but nothing came of it. There was all the material for a splendid myth, but no evolution of one. The reasoning, therefore, is fair - since Jesus <span class="accented">is</span> reported by <span class="accented">John's disciples</span> to have wrought great signs; these reports are not to be put down to credulity or fiction. The evangelist distinctly asserts that all these testimonies which he had himself recorded in <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>, when followed up by the visible and wonderful presence of the Son of God himself, were held to be true. We need not wonder, then, that <span class="cmt_word">many believed on him there.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The narrative of this chapter is a further advance in the proof that the unbelief of the Jews was aggravated by the greatness of the revelation. The issue of his sublime and culminating act of power, of his supreme and self-revealing work of transcendent tenderness and beauty, was a deeper and wilder passion of hatred. The evangelist completes his series of seven great miracles with one that in true and believing minds, evokes a new sense of the glory of God. This great last sign corresponds with the first (John it.) by being enacted amid the domestic and family life of a small and insignificant town, and also by express reference to the veritable manifestation involved in it of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, on which we have frequently commented. Baur treated the narrative as an ideal composition, illustrating the great metaphysical utterance, "<span class="accented">I</span> am the Resurrection and the Life." Keim endeavored to reduce the whole narrative to a fiction, not so well contrived as some of the evangelist's <span class="accented">tours de force</span>. This is almost as arbitrary and offensive as M. Renan's endeavor (which held its place in numerous editions of his 'Vie de Jesus') to represent the miracle as a got-up scene, into which Christ, by a kind of Divine <span class="accented">mensonge</span>, allowed himself to be drawn. Subsequently, Renan has suggested that Mary and Martha told Jesus their persuasion that such a miracle would convince his enemies, and that he replied that his bitter foes would not believe him even if Lazarus were to rise from the grave; and that this speech was expanded by tradition into an actual event. This corresponds with what Weisse had suggested, that the story is an expansion of the Lord's conversation with the sisters at Bethany. Gfrorer ('Heiligthum und Wahrheit,' p. 311, Meyer) thought that it is the story of Nain over again in a developed form, and that Nain is equivalent to Bethany; and Schenkel has fancied that the parable of <a href="../../par/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>. has been expanded into a narrative of genuine resurrection. Thorns <span class="accented">has</span>, in like manner, regarded it as the poetic expansion of the idea of the Christ as the Prince of life and Conqueror of death, and as based on the synoptic account of two resurrections, and on the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. These hypotheses are all incompatible with the simplicity of the account and with the apostolicity of the Gospel. Many attempts have been made to account for the silence of the synoptists concerning this narrative. Some writers, with Epiphanius, have said they feared, when their narratives were made public, to call such marked attention to the family of Bethany, lest they might have endangered their lives; but this is exceedingly improbable. Others have argued that this crowning miracle would not take such a conspicuous place in their less-carefully arranged records. It was only one of "many signs" wrought by our Lord with which they were familiar. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>) and Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22</a>) had already described the raising of Jairus's daughter from the bed of death, from what was believed by the onlookers to have been veritable dissolution; and Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11</a>) had shown the Lord at the gates of Nain to have royally withstood the power of death, even when the corpse of a young man was being carried out to the burial. The narrative before us is not different in kind from these, though the prelude and the accompaniments of the miracle and its consequences are all wrought out with much dramatic force, while numerous touches, by-scenes, and references are introduced which give consummate interest to the whole. Another suggestion of moment is that it was not the purpose of the synoptists to detail the incidents of our Lord's ministry in Jerusalem. Let it not be forgotten that each of the evangelists records incident and discourse to which neither of the others had access. The peculiarities of Matthew and Luke are nearly as numerous as those of the Fourth Gospel. Why should not John bring forth facts from his memory which they had left untouched? (see Introduction, p. 96.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The mystery and might of sacrificial love seen in the prelude of the miracle</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now a certain (man) was sick, (named) Lazarus, of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha</span>. The certain man who was sick, Lazarus (or Eleazar) by name, was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. The two prepositions <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> generally denote procession from, but the latter implies closer and more intimate original association; they here are put in apposition, though there are passages where they are discriminated (<a href="../../par/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-34.htm">Acts 23:34</a>; R.T. of <a href="../../par/revelation/9-18.htm">Revelation 9:18</a>). The contention of Gresswell that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> referred to present residence, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> to nativity, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> was to be found in Galilee, is not sound (see <a href="../../par/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a>). Bethany is mentioned to distinguish it from "Bethany beyond Jordan," referred to in <a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a> (see note). The town is now known as <span class="accented">El Azirieh</span>, and is about a mile and a half from Jerusalem, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. Simonis interpreted the name to mean "house of depression," "valley-town" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (Lightfoot); Reland derives its name from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, "house of dates" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>). It seems that palm branches could be then torn from the trees in the neighborhood. Arnold (Herzog., 'Enc.') derives its name from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (Aramaic), "house of the afflicted." The village has become well known in the circle of evangelic narrative from St. Luke's reference to Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38, etc.). Mary's name is probably mentioned first from the further record of her ecstatic love, which the other Gospels were diffusing through the world, and to which John makes an anticipatory reference. Her name had not been given before. In <a href="../../par/matthew/26-13.htm">Matthew 26:13</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> she was "a certain woman." John throws light on the ground of her gratitude. The efforts made by Bunyan, in his 'Jerusalem Sinner Saved,' and by Hengstenberg, to defend the pre-Reformation identification of "Mary" with the "Magdalene," and the Magdalene with the woman that was a sinner (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a> with <a href="../../par/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>), rest on insufficient grounds. The identification of the two anointings with each other is without justification. All the circumstances are different - the time, the place, the obvious reason, the motive assigned by our Lord, the conversations which followed. If a woman who was a sinner had taken such a <span class="accented">step</span>, and this expression of her gratitude had been accepted by Jesus, Mary of Bethany found more ample reason for following her example (see Dr. Schaff's admirable and extended reply to Hengstenberg). B. Weiss acutely observes that this reference shows that in the circle for which the evangelist wrote Bethany was known as the home of the sisters, and Mary as the heroine of the anointing incident. Numerous other identifications, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of Simon the Leper with Simon the Pharisee, Martha with Simon's wife, are precarious. Dean Plumptre's identification of Lazarus with the "rich young man" who is supposed to have given his all away to the poor, and who possessed nothing but a solitary garment; and his subsequent identification with the young man who fled away naked on the night of Christ's arrest, are specimens of ingenuity, but carry no conviction. The contrast between the ideas involved in the parable of <a href="../../par/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>. and this narrative is so profound that we dismiss the hypothesis of the identity of the two Lazaruses. Strauss, Keim, and others deal with it as an expansion of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, who is supposed actually to have been sent unto the people from the dead, but, in agreement with our Lord's prediction, winning no obedience. Vehement efforts are made in this and other ways to undo the commanding significance of the miracle. Bishop Wordsworth and Archdeacon Watkins are disposed to identify the Lazarus of the parable and the Lazarus of Bethany; the latter supposes the parable to have been delivered at the very time mentioned in Persea. Our Lord's statement, that the brothers of the rich man would not believe though one rose from the dead, was in some sense paralleled by the desire of the Jews to put Lazarus to death; but the reason given is that by reason of Lazarus "many of the Jews went away from them, and believed on Jesus" (<a href="../../par/john/12-11.htm">John 12:11</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/11-45.htm">John 11:45</a>, "Many of the Jews, when they beheld what he did, believed on him").

No trace of such distinction is found in the New Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a> with <a href="../../par/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>). One great distinction in biblical Greek is that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used of religious anointings, from its association with <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. is only twice used in this sense, while <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used times without number (Archbishop Trench, 'New Test.

The use of the term <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Lord," shows that the story was widely known, and that when the Gospel was written it had passed into a commonplace of Christian experience and illustration. The anointing has not yet been referred to by John, but he is looking back upon the events and anticipates his own subsequent record.

There is delicate tact and beauty in the use of the two words, one by the sisters, the other by the evangelist. The statement of needs, the simple voice of our weakness, the infant's cry, goes up to heaven. The bleat of the lost lamb is enough for the good Shepherd.

He did not remain because he loved, but, <span class="accented">though</span> he remained, and <span class="accented">because</span> he loved, he said, "Let us," etc. So that we do not see here any intention on his part, by remaining, to test their love (Olshausen), nor to exaggerate the effect of the miracle by raising a dead man from his grave rather than from his death-bed or his bier. It is not difficult to gather from the sequel that when the message reached Jesus Lazarus was dead and buried. We find that when our Lord returned to Bethany four days had elapsed since the death of Lazarus, and the four days must be calculated thus: First one long day's journey from Peraea to Bethany, a distance of eight or nine leagues. If the messenger of the sisters had taken equal time to reach Jesus in Perked, or even a longer period, as time might easily be consumed in the effort to find our Lord in the mountains of Moab; then the two days of his waiting after receiving the message would, with those occupied by the double journey, make up the four that had passed when Jesus reached the grave. Lucke, Neander, Godet, and Westcott think that our Lord remained in Peraea because there was work in which he was engaged and could not relinquish. Meyer, Moulton, and Weiss, that he waited for some especial communication from his Father, for some revelation of moral necessity and heavenly inspiration, like those which dictated all his other movements. B. Weiss: "It was a sacrifice to his calling, of his heart's most ardent desires, that he remained quietly two days in the same place." "We see," says Edersheim, "Christ once more asleep while the disciples are despairing, swamped in the storm! Christ never in haste, because always sure." The silences of Scripture and the waitings of God are often without explanation. The event proves that deep purpose presided over them. The "let us go," etc., implies a lofty courage, a sense of coming crisis. Love conquers fear and peril for himself and his followers. "Judaea" is mentioned rather than Bethany for the same reason. The "again" points forcibly back to the last visit, when he told both friends and foes that the good Shepherd would snatch his sheep from the jaws of death, even though he lay down his own life in the doing of it.

Here in Peraea Jesus found appreciative listeners.  The disciples are more in fear for their Master than for themselves. The residence beyond Jordan had been brief, and they are amazed that the Lord will so soon put himself in the power of that seething and hostile crowd.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</span> The answer of Jesus is a further deliverance concerning the human law and season (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) of work - a parable drawn from earthly and human analogies, which will unquestionably have a direct bearing on the conditions of Divine service at all time, and is therefore applicable to the disciples with himself. It receives also special significance from some aspects of Christ's own ministry, and from the step he had just now declared that he intended to take. Of course, the parable is based upon the conditions of human work; one of these conditions is <span class="accented">light</span>, another of them is <span class="accented">time</span>. Light is necessary for all the wise efforts of men - the light of day, the light of this world or the sun; we must see whither we are going, in order to avoid the occasions of stumbling. We must submit to this comprehensive condition, or we fail (cf. here <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, "I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work"). There are two kinds of night of which he speaks. One is the night which arrests all labor, the night of death; and the other is the night of ignorance and unbelief, when the light that is in a man becomes darkness, when, if a man does attempt to work or walk, he will stumble. Meyer and some others, from the reference to another condition, viz. that of <span class="accented">time</span>, persist in limiting the notion of the <span class="accented">day</span> to that of the period of service, about which the Lord says also some very solemn things; and Meyer objects to Luthardt and others, who give to the sun, to the light of this world, any moral or spiritual meaning. We need not limit the application. Light may mean knowledge of duty supplied by God's providence and the revelation of his will, and so far as "day" is made by light, it is important to notice it here. But <span class="accented">time</span> is an equally important condition, and whereas in <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> the Lord laid emphasis upon the <span class="accented">limited</span> amount of opportunity during which the light lasts and the work can be done; so here there is an <span class="accented">appointed</span> period during which stumbling is unnecessary: "twelve hours in the day." This (I take to be Christ's meaning) is one of these hours, and before the night comes "I must work." Godet suggests that the disciples, by this question, recommended him not to shorten his career by courting danger, and so to create for himself "a thirteenth hour" to the day, in which he would secure no blessing; that the Lord condemned the proposal, knowing that he was immortal till his hour had come; and that if we shrink from a call of duty, and thus save ourselves, adding an unhallowed increment to our day of useless work, we incur the like condemnation, we shall stumble. Let it be observed that the reason for working in the night is not because we have twelve hours for duty and no more, but because, though we have a time of service and an opportunity, we have let both slip past us, and then the work is difficult and perilous if we do attempt it. Some have said that Judas, Peter, Thomas, <span class="accented">etc</span>., walked in the night, and that they stumbled and fell. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-10.htm">John 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</span> He shuts himself off from the light of God-given opportunity, and carries no lamp in his soul. There is no necessity to suppose, in <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, that the day was drawing to a close, or that in this place a natural day was dawning; but there is some probability from this phraseology that John adopted the Babylonian rather than the Roman method of computing the hours of the day. This has decided bearing on several important questions (notes, <a href="../../par/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6, 52</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>). The "twelve hours" shows, at all events, that the Jews at this time generally reckoned from sunrise to sunset. It must be remembered that the day differed considerably in length at different parts of the year, from fourteen hours to nine; but perhaps the emphatic use of the expression derives special interest from the fact that the equinox was approaching. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things spake he,</span> and probably many more words expository of the vast principle of service which he here propounded; <span class="cmt_word">and after this</span> (for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> implies a break, during which the disciples pondered his words) <span class="cmt_word">he saith, Our friend Lazarus</span>; implying that Lazarus was well known to the disciples, and that the Lord classes himself here, in wondrous condescension, with <span class="accented">them</span>. He elsewhere speaks of the twelve as his "friends" (<a href="../../par/john/15-14.htm">John 15:14, 15</a>, where he made it a higher designation than <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>; see also <a href="../../par/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>). John the Baptist also calls himself "the Bridegroom's friend" (<a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>). Though Lazarus had passed into the region of the unknown and unseen, he was still" our friend." <span class="cmt_word">Hath fallen asleep</span>. Meyer says that Jesus knew this by "spiritual far-seeing;" and Godet thinks that he knew it by supernatural process, and had known it all along. It does not require much beyond what we know to have occurred in thousands of instances, for our Lord to have perceived that his friend had died - had, as he said, "fallen asleep," in that new sense in which Jesus was teaching men to look on death. <span class="cmt_word">But I go, that I may awake him out of sleep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is a late Greek word; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a>). Wunsche says the Talmud often speaks of a rabbi's death under the form of" sleep" ('Moed. K.,' fol. 28, a; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-24.htm">Matthew 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>). Homer spoke of death and sleep as "twin sisters," Christ's power and consciousness of power to awake Lazarus from sleep gives, however, to his use of the image a new meaning. It is not the eternal sleep of the Greek and Roman poets. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-12.htm">John 11:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The disciples</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore say unto him, Lord, if he have fallen asleep, he will recover</span>. Wunsche quotes 'Berach,' fol. 57, b, "Sleep is a good sign for the sick." The language of the disciples is somewhat remarkable; at least their misunderstanding is puzzling (Reuss and Strauss think it is a sign of the unhistorical); but it probably arose out of the statement, made two days before, that "the sickness was not unto death," and from their eager and affectionate desire to prevent their Lord's retraining to Judaea. <span class="accented">If he have fallen asleep</span>, <span class="accented">he well recover</span> (<span class="accented">be saved</span>). The whole narrative is throbbing with deeper meanings than lie on the surface of it. The theory of the sanitary effects of sleep in fever are well known, and the rousing from such sleep might seem hazardous; but the disciples were catching at straws to save their Master. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-13.htm">John 11:13</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, though in the present tense, represents a time anterior to the time of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is found in Ecclus. 46:19. This is an explanation of the misunderstanding, occasioned, perhaps, by the statement of ver. 4, and further elucidated by what follows. A difference prevails between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as both words are used for sleep; but the former has rather the idea of the repose accompanying sleep, the latter the phenomenon itself. With one or two exceptions, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is always used in the New Testament of the sleep of death, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> never. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-14.htm">John 11:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jesus therefore said to them plainly</span>.

When Jesus described the condition of Lazarus in figurative language, he made use of a metaphor which would have peculiar application in his ease. The grace of Christ will turn the death of his beloved throughout all time into restful sleep. Lazarus was part of the method by which this transformation would be effected. The Christian idea soon found far richer expression than classical poetry or rabbinism could supply (<a href="../../par/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-52.htm">Matthew 27:52</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).

Death could not have occurred in his presence; at least, as Bengel says, we never read of any one dying in the presence of the Prince of life. Whenever he came into contact with death, he conquered the great enemy. Still, this was not the absolute reason for his gladness. The gladness was conditioned by the need of the disciples, not merely for the comfort of the sisters, or for his own greater glory, <span class="cmt_word">but for your sakes, to the end that ye might believe</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> is often used absolutely (<a href="../../par/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 50</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-41.htm">John 4:41, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-36.htm">John 6:36</a>; and many other places). The disciples had believed something of Christ's power before (see <a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>, etc.); but every act of faith prepares the way for another. Every fresh exercise of faith makes all previous efforts in the same direction appear elementary (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/5-13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>, T.R.). The joy of Jesus in the augmenting faith of his disciples is one of the most pathetic and instructive features of this Gospel (see <a href="../../par/john/16-31.htm">John 16:31</a>, and notes). The kingdom of God among men was, so far as we can see, dependent on the amount of faith that the apostles could be induced to cherish in the fact of the Incarnation during the brief period of this ministry. The Church has not yet come to a full understanding of all that he was. But if the disciples had not known his power over death, they would have been destitute of the alphabet of this new language, of the foundations of the spiritual city they had to build. Jesus rejoiced when disciples believed. So he does still. <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless, let us go to him</span> - to Lazarus, who still lives with God (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>, and parallel passages). This is very remarkable. Even the dead body is in this case still (cf. <a href="../../par/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>).

This apostle is mentioned in the synoptic Gospels with Matthew, and in Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>) with Philip. He is classed with the fishermen (<a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>), and may therefore have been a Galilaean. Ecclesiastical tradition has associated him with Judas (not Iscariot) (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:13), and with Judas the brother of Jesus. He is reputed to have preached ultimately in Parthia and India, there to have suffered martyrdom. The various references to him in this Gospel give, by a few vivid touches, a biography and characterization of singular congruity. <span class="cmt_word">He said to his fellow-disciples</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is only used in this place, and shows that the body of the disciples were being more and more blended into a unity), <span class="cmt_word">Let us go, that we may die with him.</span> Here he manifests a fervent love to his Master, tinged with a sorrowful, melancholy temperament. He saw the danger to his Lord, but at once, with the spirit of self-surrender, was ready to share his fate. Moulton says these words reveal love, but they are "the language of despair and vanished hope. This is the end of all - death, not Messianic kingdom." Surely Thomas may have pondered much the Lord's words about his approaching death, and may have felt ready, along the same line, willingly to yield up his own life for his Master's or with his Master. Too much has been made of Thomas's skepticism and criticism. He was one who wanted visible, tangible evidence; but he was prepared to act impulsively, and to give powerful expression to his faith, whenever the evidence was granted. In <a href="../../par/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a> he was still in the dark, but it was not an evil darkness. How could he know, with the clearness which his mind naturally desiderated, whither our Lord was going? No brainless or heartless unbelief led him to ask, "How can we know the way?" At last (<a href="../../par/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24</a>, etc.), when he wanted ocular, personal, tangible evidence of the resurrection of Jesus, and absented himself in deep melancholy from the company of the eleven, it is clear that his soul was ready for the full manifestation. Before he could have put his finger into the print of the nails, he exclaimed, with adoring gratitude, "MY LORD AND MY GOD!" His hesitation and his conviction, with his superlative ecstatic cry, form the culminating point of the Gospel.

These four days are differently counted. Alford, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, Lange, Gorier, Westcott, and Moulton believe that this mention proves that Lazarus died and was buried on the day on which the message was sent, which, if it took one day to deliver, and if one day had been consumed in the return of Jesus, would leave the other two days as those of the delay in Peraea. Meyer and Ewald, with Bengel and Watkins, think that he died at the conclusion of the <span class="accented">delay</span>, that Jesus became aware of it, and told his disciples of it, and spent the two days, or parts of them, in the journey; that on the fourth day he reached Bethany. The former and usual view is the more obvious one, although it must turn ultimately on the position of Bethany beyond Jordan. If the recent speculations of the Palestine Exploration Society and Caspari be correct, the distance between the two Bethanys may have required at least two days for the journey, and therefore favors the latter interpretation. If Bethany (Bethabara) be near Jericho, the distance between them would be much less, and the former and usual reckoning must prevail. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a></div><div class="verse">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem</span>. This geographical observation is introduced to explain the following verse. Meyer and Alford think that the use of the past tense, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, may be perfectly justified in making reference to past events; yet, since John is the only New Testament writer who uses it, the usage may have been adopted by him because, at the time when he wrote his Gospel, Bethany had been for the time destroyed with Jerusalem itself. The construction is peculiar: <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> (compare a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-8.htm">John 21:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>; see Winer, p. 697, Eng. trans.). Many think that it is to be understood - <span class="cmt_word">about fifteen stadia from it</span> - a kind of trajection of the preposition; but Winer thinks that it points to the spot where the fifteen stadia might be supposed to terminate, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "lying off at the end of the fifteen stadia," and so giving an adverbial force to the preposition: and he adds a long list of similar constructions in later Greek writers. The stadium was 606.75 feet - less than the eighth of an English mile; the distance was therefore between a mile and a half and a mile and three quarters. <span class="cmt_word">And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary.</span> "The Jews" is a phrase generally, not uniformly, used by John to denote those permanently hostile to our Lord, and often of the upper and ruling classes. These, therefore, had one  more trial of faith, one further opportunity of recognizing his glory. <span class="accented">Many of them came</span> <span class="accented">to Martha and Mary</span>. They came to comfort them, according to ordinary usage among the Jews after bereavement. This ceremony often lasted seven days. Concerning (their) brother. We cling to earthly love. The gush of strong affection that mourners lavish on the dead deepens their love to one another, and the praises of the departed often gild and almost pierce the veil itself. The fact that <span class="accented">many</span> Jews should have taken the trouble to journey nearly two miles to comfort the bereaved sisters shows that the family at Bethany was one of some wealth, position, and importance (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-13</a>). If so, it is exceedingly unlikely that the narrative stands in any relation to the parable of the rich man and the beggar.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-20.htm">John 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat <i>still</i> in the house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> points back probably to ver. 1. The type of character so beautifully contrasted in the previous reference to the family at Bethany appears again, and confirms the historical character of <a href="../../par/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38</a>, etc., as well as of the narrative before us. Thoma says that this picture is "simply painted with synoptic color." Martha is the mistress of the house. <span class="cmt_word">Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</span> Martha was a woman of impulse, energy, practical duty; like Peter, she was ready even to give advice to her Lord, and eager to put everybody in his rightful place. On the first opportunity she hastened at once to "meet" Jesus, even without at first warning her sister of his approach. Mary, contemplative, pensive, undemonstrative under ordinary circumstances, but with a great fund of love, was sitting in the house receiving the condolences of the Jews (cf. ver. 19). Weiss suggests that Jesus was well aware, from the station of the family, and from the fact that hitherto his own friendship for the sisters had not submitted <span class="accented">them</span> to the ban, that "many Jews" would have congregated in the house of mourning. Consequently, Jesus does not come straight to the house, but allows it to be known that he is there. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Martha therefore (having met her Lord) said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> expresses no complaint: "If thou hadst been here," a simple condition of what is now an impossible event - <span class="cmt_word">my brother had not died.</span> Meyer says, "If thou weft making thy residence in Bethany rather than in Peraea." This is somewhat unnatural, and would have been a complaint. Her faith had at least ground enough for this assurance, but she mounts above it. The two sisters, with their contrasted natures, had grasped the life-giving, joy-diffusing, heaven-revealing powers of Jesus. They had believed in him, with a gracious abandonment of all prejudice and in the sweeping force of a great illuminating love. They had said often this same thing to one another, and now Martha pours her high persuasion into the ears of her Lord; but she proceeds further. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-22.htm">John 11:22</a></div><div class="verse">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give <i>it</i> thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And even now I know, that whatsoever thing thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> may be contrasted with ver. 27. In his presence she knows intuitively that nothing is impossible. The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> is a word of more human quality than that which our Lord customarily used for <span class="accented">his own</span> appeals to God. He spoke of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, to seek as an equal; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>,, <span class="accented">to</span> intercede for another; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to pray; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to supplicate. It was appropriate enough that Martha should use the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>. Her word was a burst of excited feeling, and does not dictate to the Master what he should do. Her twofold mention of the name of God with "thou" and "thee," shows that she had not risen to highest light on the Lord's mysterious relation to the Father. She speaks of him and to him as of a strangely gifted human Friend. But she had doubtless heard of the widow of Nain, and of Jairus's daughter, and she made no irrational suggestion. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> covers much. Jesus loved Lazarus. He was Friend to the whole group, and known to them all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-23.htm">John 11:23</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again</span>. Hengstenberg thinks that the reply of Jesus is a grand dogmatic assertion of the resurrection of the dead, in special application to Lazarus, and it covers the kind of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> which takes place at death, as well as the resurrection at the last day. If so, surely our Lord would have said, "Lazarus is risen again." The Lord does elsewhere speak of the dead as risen, and of their angelic state, and of all the dead living unto God; but he is here speaking of the immediate resurrection of Lazarus from what is called death to that which is called life, and which would be a pledge and type of the final resurrection of all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-24.htm">John 11:24</a></div><div class="verse">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Martha saith to him, I know</span> <span class="cmt_word">that he will rise again at the resurrection in the last day.</span> Some disappointment is revealed in this speech, such as we have all felt with the promise of an ultimate resurrection, when the grave has closed over some dear friend. We find small relief in the assurance. The old ties are snapped, the old ways are at an end. We shall go to the dead: he will not return to us. The last day is too far off to comfort us concerning our brother. That the answer of Martha is important as revealing belief in the resurrection at the last day; of which, however, it must be remembered those who had heard our Lord's own assertions about it could no longer have doubted (<a href="../../par/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39, 40, 44, 54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>). The teachings of Jesus in this Gospel with reference to eternal life made the promise of resurrection, the transfiguration of the physical life of man, a necessity, not a contradiction. The reply of Martha shows that she does not as yet grasp the whole truth. "The last day" may be far nearer in her thought than we now know it to have been, or them it is to us; still, however near, it would imply a complete transformation of all these sweet human relationships. She longed to have the home as it was before Lazarus died. It is, however, of very great interest that we have, on the part of a Jew, this profound expectation of resurrection and immortality. Jews, or at least Pharisees, had derived from Old Testament thought - from Genesis, and from Job, and from the Psalter, from the Books of Daniel and Ezekiel, and from the progress of human thought as evinced in 'Wisdom of Solomon'  - a great belief in both. Martha reveals incidentally the new light which had been cast on the mystery of the grave by the words and acts of Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection</span>. Not merely that God will give me what I ask, but that I am in some sense already his gift to man of <span class="accented">resurrection</span>, inasmuch as <span class="cmt_word">I am</span> that of <span class="cmt_word">Life</span>. (So Luthardt and Godet, but not Meyer, who makes <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span> the positive result of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>.) By taking humanity into his Person, Christ reveals the permanence of human individuality, that is, of such individuality as is in union with himself. He associates (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) "the Life" which he gives with" the Way" and "the Truth," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with the whole sum of human experience and of human meditation and speculation, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with all the conduct of the will and the mind. <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live.</span> In these words he identifies the "life" with the transfiguration of the bodily life. The grand method of this blessed <span class="accented">life</span> is faith. The life which is the condition and ground of resurrection is the natural consequence of a faith which accepts Christ, and identifies itself with him. But "there are some who have believed, and have what you call died" - <span class="accented">though they die</span>, <span class="accented">they shall live</span>. In such cases, so-called "death" is veritable "life." The life of faith will survive the shock of death, <span class="cmt_word">and whosoever liveth, and believeth on me, shall never die</span> - shall never taste of death (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51, 8</a>:51). This is no new teaching for the more thoughtful of his hearers. There are multitudes now believing (and therefore living) in him. They shall <span class="accented">never die</span> in the sense in which death has been hitherto regarded; <span class="accented">they shall by no means die forever</span>. Faith is eternal life: death is only a momentary shadow upon a life which is far better. Whether the corruption of the grave passes over the believer or not, he lives an eternal life, which has no element of death nor proclivity to death in it. So far the Lord is lifting Martha to a higher experience of life and a comparative in difference to death. Before he offers any further consolation, he probes to the quick her faith in him and in the eternal life. <span class="cmt_word">Believest thou this?</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>; "Is <span class="accented">this</span> thy belief?" not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>; "Dost thou believe in my statement?" "Believest thou that the Resurrection which <span class="accented">I am</span> and which <span class="accented">I give</span> can thus transform for thee the whole meaning of death?" The fullness of life after death is assured in virtue of the resurrection which Christ could effect at any moment, and will eventually effect for all. This <span class="accented">life</span> of which Christ speaks may be the life which is the consequence of the resurrection (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of man effected in the Incarnation, or it may be the condition of "resurrection" and sufficient proof that, if a man receive it by faith, he is free' from all the curse of physical death, and assured of a perfect victory over it. So also the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> may either mean "not forever," and thus the words may be taken to refer to the resurrection. "He will not forever die," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. death may supervene, but will be conquered; or <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> may mean "never," "in no wise," and the "never die" may refer to spiritual death, overlooking physical death altogether. The whole narrative is a great parable of life through death.

The reply admits the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>; Many seem to think that Martha falls back on theocratic technicality after a high flight of faith, and leaves the solution of her deepest anxieties to the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">I have believed</span>, not now for the first time, <span class="cmt_word">that thou art the Christ</span> of all our highest hopes and of our prophetic Scriptures - <span class="cmt_word">the Son of God</span> in the sense in which Nathanael, and the healed blind man, and the heroic Peter, and John the Baptist have regarded thee, not now dawning on the world as an unexpected apparition, but long since <span class="accented">awaited - even</span> he that cometh into the world, the Hope of all, in fact, the Resurrection and the Life because the Christ, and the Christ because the Son of God. In her great faith these deeper truths, just announced, are implicitly involved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a></div><div class="verse">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When she had said this</span>, <span class="cmt_word">she departed, and called Mary her sister secretly.</span> Observe the important emendation of text from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. When she had made this great utterance, her heart is big with hope. The grim shadow of death is now transparent to a heavenly light. She must share her hope with her sister. Jesus gave the commission to fetch Mary, as is obvious from the words of Martha which follow. The term "secretly" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), when elsewhere used, precedes the verb with which it is associated, and therefore here it is joined with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whispering</span> to her, lest the hostile Jews should hear and intercept the interview. <span class="cmt_word">The Master</span> (the Teacher) used absolutely (cf. <a href="../../par/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">is here, and calleth for thee.</span> Sacred summons!

"<span class="accented">Wailing"</span> is often the regulated expression of professional grief; "weeping" the irresistible burst of personal sorrow.

She does not add a word of remonstrance or suggestion. She moans forth the same confident expression of her sense of the love and power of Jesus.

Meyer thinks that the contrast between their hypocritical or professional tears and her genuine emotion, the blending of these incongruous elements, the combination of a profound affliction of a dear friend and the simulated grief of his bitter enemies, led him to manifest the feeling here described. But we have no right to import such an element into the scene. The concerted wailing was, however, the occasion of what is described in very remarkable terms, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and its compounds is used in the classics and the LXX. in the sense of hot anger, neither pain nor grief (though it is not very evident that it goes so far as this in <a href="../../par/mark/1-43.htm">Mark 1:43</a>). Luther translated it <span class="accented">ergrimmete</span>, and Passow gives no other meaning. This seems generally accepted. But at what was Jesus angered? This can be answered only by deciding whether <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is the dative of the object, or whether it is the instrument or sphere of his holy indignation. According to the old Greek expositors, Origen, Chrysostom, Cyril, Theophylact - and they are followed by Alford and Hilgenfeld, the latter of whom finds in it a hint of the Gnostic Christology which, in his opinion, pervades the Gospel - the anger might have been directed against his own human spirit, at that moment tempted into an unfilial strain of sympathy with the mourners; yet, if this be its meaning, why was it that Jesus subsequently wept himself? and why, instead of exciting himself, instead of shuddering with his bitterness of feeling, did he not (as Hengstenberg says) compose and quiet himself? Beside, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span> would have been a far more appropriate term to use for the effective and sympathetic part of his nature than <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. It is possible, if "the spirit" <span class="accented">expresses</span> that part of his human nature in special fellowship with the Father, to suppose that he felt a certain antagonism with that within himself which had prompted to some immediate manifestation of Divine power, and to translate, "<span class="accented">He</span> sternly checked his spirit." But the miracle of Divine struggle with death followed so immediately that this cannot be the true explanation (Westcott suggests it as an alternative, but not the best interpretation). The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, must be the sphere of his holy wrath, for which we must find some explanation. Meyer's seems (as already said) to be altogether insufficient. So also in our opinion is that of Godet, viz. that this act of victorious conflict with death, on which he was entering, involved his own death-warrant by being the occasion of the last outbreak of malice on the part of the Jews. Such a fact would be out of harmony, not only with the Fourth Gospel, but with the (synoptic) struggle in Gethsemane. Now, without enumerating various other interpretations of the passage, we think Augustine, Erasmus, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, Moulton, meet our difficulty by the suggestion that death itself occasioned this indignation. Though, like the good Physician in the house of mourning, he knew the issue of his mighty act, yet he entered with vivid and intense human sympathy into all the primary and secondary sorrows of death. He saw the long procession of mourners from the first to the last, all the reckless agony, all the hopelessness of it, in thousands of millions of instances. There flashed upon his spirit all the terrible moral consequences of which death was the ghastly symbol. lie knew that within a short time he too, in taking upon himself the sins of men, would have taken upon himself their death, and there was enough to rouse in his spirit a Divine indignation, and he groaned and shuddered. He roused himself to a conflict which would be a prelibation of the cross and the burial. He took the diseases of men upon himself when he took them away. He took the death-agony of Lazarus and the humiliation of the grave and the tears of the sisters upon himself when he resolved to cry, "Lazarus, come forth!" and to snatch from the grasp of the grim conqueror for a little while one of his victims. Compare the toil of Hercules in wrestling with death for the wife of Admetus. Compare also <a href="../../par/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a>, where moral proximity to the treacherous heart and ghastly deed and approaching doom of Judas made him once more to shudder.

The shortest verse, but one of the most suggestive in the entire Scripture. The great wrath against death is subdued now into <span class="accented">tears</span> of love, of sympathy, and of deep emotion. Jesus shed tears of sympathetic sorrow. This is in sacred and eternal refutation of the theory which deprives the incarnate Logos of St. John of human heart and spirit. These tears have been for all the ages a grand testimony to the fullness of his humanity, and also a Diving revelation of the very heart of God (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). It was not a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as the weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>), but profound and wondrous fellow-feeling with human misery in all its forms, then imaged before him in the grave of Lazarus. It is akin to the judicial blindness which has obscured for the T&uuml;bingen school so much of the glory of Divine revelation, that Baur should regard this weeping of Jesus as unhistorical.

(<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>; <span class="accented">amabat</span>, not <span class="accented">diligebat</span>). Tears are often the expression of love as well as grief. Hengstenberg sees in the cry of the better class of these Jews, "How has he then let him die?" probably he could not have helped him if he would. In the language of the other Jews there was the suggestion of inability, and the ironical hint that the cure of the blind man, which had created so great a commotion, was only a delusion. Perhaps, too, a covert expectation of some further display of wonder-working power. Strauss regards it as unhistorical that the previous restorations from the dead should not be cited. But surely, when John wrote this Gospel, the story of the widow's son and of Jairus's daughter was known throughout the world. And if, in the middle of the second century, this Gospel had been written by a speculative theologian, who deliberately set himself to concoct such a narrative as this, with the view of completing the picture of the Vanquisher of Hades, he <span class="accented">would</span> most certainly have cited the Galilaean miracles. John, however, is merely recording his own experiences. These <span class="accented">Jews</span> at that time may never have heard of either Nain or the daughter of Jairus, and spoke merely of that which was within their own recollection and experience. As they stand here, these words are striking testimony to their historical validity. The Gospel which most unequivocally establishes the claim of our Lord to a Divine Personality or subsistence, is more explicit than any of them in asserting his pure humanity, and giving proofs of it.

The former kind of cave is shown at Bethany, but no dependence can be placed on the tradition. (Cf. the account of our Lord's own tomb, to which a stone was roiled, <a href="../../par/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-3.htm">Mark 16:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-2.htm">Luke 24:2</a>; cf. also Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' pp. 101-108; and art. "Burial," in Smith's 'Dictionary.') The tomb of Joseph was that of a rich man, and all these circumstances show opulence, rather than the beggary and rags of the Lazarus of the parable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been <i>dead</i> four days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone</span>.  <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> has rather the idea of "lift" than "roll away;" it is used for "take," "take away," "carry as a burden." <span class="cmt_word">Martha, the sister of him that was dead,</span> <span class="cmt_word">said unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been four days here</span>. Martha's language is another singular illustration of the desire on her part to give a certain kind of advice and direction to our Lord, as though he might be the wiser and bettor for her monitions. The characterization of her as "the sister of the dead" man is not needed for identification, but rather to explain or justify her intrusion upon the solemn, stately direction of the Lord. She shrank from such an exposure of the body of her beloved brother, as an unnecessary act, since he was only to rise at the last day, or to be regarded <span class="accented">by</span> his faith in Christ before his death as having already passed from death and through death into a new life. She must have relinquished at that moment all hope of resurrection of the body of Lazarus there and then: <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he already stinketh." This is explained by many of the Fathers as proof that our Lord not only raised from death-swoon Jairus's daughter, and the young man on his way to burial, but also a putrefying corpse; thus giving three symbols of the effects of sin: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a young life blighted; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a man's energies dissipated and his  condition apparently hopeless; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a type also of one dead in trespasses and sins (Trench on the Miracles) - one whose habits of trespass and bondage to evil seem to forbid all renewal. Godet thinks that Martha had special reasons for such a speech. Others, that all that we have here is the <span class="accented">speculation</span> or <span class="accented">lanai</span> of Martha, and that it must be so. She puts one more arrest, as it would seem, upon the free act and love of Jesus. This seems quite sufficient to account for the use of the word. It would seem that, for some reason, the body had not been fully embalmed, or she would not have used the expression. Still, all had been done with spices and perfumes that was intended. The T&uuml;bingen criticism eagerly lays hold on this point, as proof that the fourth evangelist intended by such a touch to exalt and exaggerate the wonder-working power of Christ. There is no need whatever to see in it more than Martha's sisterly love getting the better of her submission to her Master's order. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "For he is of the fourth day (dead) (buried)." On the fourth day the countenance changes, and, as the Jewish proverb urged, the spirit takes its flight from the sepulcher, and no longer hovers over the departed form. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-40.htm">John 11:40</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldst see the glory of God?</span> This was a probable reference to the language of ver. 4, and also to the teaching of vers. 25, 26, where our Lord had encouraged her imperfect faith in himself to become a veritable vision of Divine glory. Out of the deepest humiliation comes the highest glory, The putrefaction of the grave is a stepping-stone to his throne. More is meant than the physical resurrection of Lazarus. She would or might by faith see the glory of Divine power and love which would, by what was about to happen, dawn upon her. Christ was going to prove to faith that he could and would destroy the power of death, rob him of sting, swallow up the grave in victory, and proclaim the everlasting curse of this mysterious flesh of ours to be a vanquished foe. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a></div><div class="verse">Then they took away the stone <i>from the place</i> where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Then they took away the stone [ from the place where the dead was laid]. They lifted the stone, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesus lifted up his eyes</span> <span class="accented">to heaven</span>. This is not to be taken as an ordinary prayer, but a thanksgiving for prayer already heard. "Jesus lifted up his eyes," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to heaven - to that sublime symbol of the infinite activity of God, which surrounds us day and night, and which is in numerous religious systems made a type and image of the Divine Being himself; nor does our modern conception of the universe dethrone it from this high place. Christ's language is thanksgiving that God has already heard him. Godet and Hengstenberg say that Jesus thanked God in anticipation of the miracle, as though it were already done. Meyer and Alford look back to some earlier prayers. But surely there is some reason for the thanksgiving. The stone is <span class="accented">lifted</span>, or <span class="accented">removed</span>; there lies the corpse, but no dank sepulchral vapor issues from it; rather some sign is given that prayer offered by Christ had been already heard, and that death has not made the havoc with the frame which would otherwise have occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me</span>. When he uttered the prayer we cannot say; but we know that his mind was greatly exercised concerning his friend before he left Peraea. His words confess that his wishes have been in harmony with the Divine eternal will. So elsewhere the Lord tells his disciples, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "your desires will be in harmony with the Divine purpose; you will not be able to pray for anything either temporal or spiritual which God will not bestow, has not indeed prepared himself to bestow and you to receive." This is the true mystery and meaning of prayer. The hypothesis of the twofold nature of Christ, instead of being shipwrecked on the fact of his prayers and intercessions, throws light on the very nature of prayer itself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a></div><div class="verse">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said <i>it</i>, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I knew that thou hearest me always, but because of the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.</span> This great utterance declares all the intimate relation which subsists between the Father of all and the Son in Jesus. A continuous absolute communion is ever going on between heaven and earth in the heart of Jesus. His consciousness of the Father is a door opened in heaven. Alas! these words have been a stumbling-block to many; have suggested to Baur the idea of a "show-prayer," and to Weisse a "deceptive prayer" (<span class="accented">schaugebet</span>), and to Strauss that they were introduced into a later but in-authentic narrative of the second century to establish the Divinity of Christ. The simple fact is that the words are not "petition" at all, but they are spoken thought and Divine communion, graciously unveiled for the advantage of the disciples. They are built upon the wonderful assurance which had been repeatedly given by our Lord of his union with and association in unique Personality with the Father. We see from <a href="../../par/john/16-29.htm">John 16:29-31</a> that the profound desire occupying the heart of Jesus was that his disciples, first of all, should know that he came out from God, and almost with pathetic eagerness he asks them, "Do ye now believe?" But in <a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a> he shows that his wishes were not limited to the faith of disciples, but extended to the production of a like conviction in the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Here he says, after a pause, "I know that thou art hearing me always." There is no surprise in the discovery that Lazarus was as he really is. Christ's own prayers are always heard, even those in Gethsemane and on the cross (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="accented">I said it for the multitude that standeth around</span>.

To what does he refer, what saying has he uttered for the sake of this miscellaneous group? Surely to the great declaration, "I thank thee that thou heardest me." His reason for the audible utterance of his gratitude is, "That they may believe that thou didst send me." If he had <span class="accented">not</span> uttered this thanksgiving, the multitude would have glorified <span class="accented">him</span> rather than his Father, nor would they have learned, as now they may, that he came forth from God.

The loud voice keeps up the image that death is a deep sleep. The critical moment in Christ's own career has arrived, when, having pledged the rather to this manifestation of his own glory, he was prepared to take this final step, however perilous to himself; one which would finally demonstrate whether he was sent from God, or was merely boasting a power he did not possess (cf. Elijah and the priests of Baal, <a href="../../par/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.). Observe the loud voice, <span class="cmt_word">Lazarus, come forth</span>! or, (<span class="accented">Hither</span>, <span class="accented">out!</span>); or, <span class="accented">Veni foras!</span> (Origen, Chrysostom, Lampe, suggest <span class="accented">that</span> the awakening from death had already taken place. Meyer and Alford condemn this. It seems to me that this supposition. somewhat modified as above, throws light upon vers. 41, 42.) The words themselves are applicable to a grave from which the stone door had been removed. Weiss has made some admirable remarks on the use made by the T&uuml;bingen critics of this admission. In many cases in which such miracles took place the soul had obviously not left the body, but yet the entire surroundings here imply that, apart from miraculous energy, resuscitation was absolutely un-looked for. Even Strauss refuses utterly the trance hypothesis, and Renan has renounced the farcical drama that he thought at one time might account for the event and its record.

Both suppositions would be unnecessary adjuncts of the proof of the glory of God and power of Christ. Lucke and others refer to the habit of swathing separate limbs, but in such a way as not to impede motion if the person thus swathed desired it. Meyer and Godet see no necessity for the suggestion of the early writers. Kuinoel thinks that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> was used of the mere struggle of the swathed body to escape. The above supposition is the most probable.

The remark would then be in harmony with the fact to which the evangelist continually calls attention, that Christ's miracles and words produced a twofold effect, and made a frequent division among the Jews, thus bringing to light who were and who were not his true disciples. The same facts excited faith in some and roused animosity in others. The great sign has been dividing men into hostile camps ever since.

If a formal meeting of the great council, if "the Sanhedrin," had been summoned, the article would have been used. (On the Sanhedrin, see Winer, art. "Sanhedrin," in his 'Bib. R. Wort.;' Lange, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.; Edersheim, vol. 2:553, etc. This name is Greek (though Hebraized in the Talmud), and signifies the supreme court of the people, resident in Jerusalem, consisting of seventy-one members, with a president, <span class="accented">Nasi</span>, and a vice-president, <span class="accented">Ab-baith-den</span>.) Extraordinary sessions of the Sanhedrin were called at the house of the high priest, but ordinary sessions in some rooms adjoining the temple. The points submitted to their cognizance were hierarchical and religious. They had at this time lost their actual power of inflicting capital punishment. They were a court of appeal from lower courts in the province, framed after the same model. Pharisees and Sadducees were alike to be found in their number. The family of Annas, his sons, and his son-in-law Caiaphas, were all Sadducees, and embraced the priestly part of the assembly. They were the most deadly enemies of Christ throughout. The Pharisees are scarcely again mentioned in the account of the Passion. The priestly Sadducean party became also bitter enemies of Christianity and of the Church during apostolic times. Here they take the initiative. <span class="cmt_word">And they said, What are we about? because this Man</span> <span class="cmt_word">is</span> (as we must admit) <span class="cmt_word">doing many signs</span>, which will produce a perilous effect among the people. There were certain aspects and views both of the Pharisaic and Sadducean party with which our Lord's teaching coincided. When he denounced ritualism, literalism, and tradition, and laid emphasis on moral law, he had to some extent the ear of the Sadducees; when he cleansed the temple of the priestly bazaar, when he rebuked the secular conceptions of Messianic glory, the Pharisees inwardly rejoiced. Nevertheless, they had both too many g-rounds of criticism and dislike not to combine against him. The council of the nation found it a delicate and difficult task to frame charges in which the entire authorities of the nation and the popular clamor could coincide.

And Annas and Caiaphas are both said to be "high priests" (<a href="../../par/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2</a>). In <a href="../../par/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a> Annas is spoken of as high priest, Caiaphas being associated with "John and Alexander." This becomes more comprehensible when we learn from Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02. 2 and 4. 3) that Valerius Gratus (in the year A.D. ) had deprived Annas (or Hanan, Ananias, Ananas) of the office, "when he had held it for seven years." So great, however, was the influence of Annas, that, either to consult his temper or that of the people, who would consider him the legal high priest, the office was conferred upon members of his family in succession, first on Ishmael, then on Eleazer the son of Ishmael, then on Simon his son, and finally on Joseph Caiaphas (who is declared by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>) to be the son-in-law of Annas, thus explaining his appointment on the one hand, and the continued influence on the other of the unscrupulous Annas, who was high priest de <span class="accented">jure</span>). Joseph Caiaphas held the office from A.D.  to A.D. , and thus throughout the ministry of Jesus. The apostle's remark (repeated <a href="../../par/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>) that he was "high priest that same year" has been set down by Strauss, Scholton, and others to ignorance on the part of the writer of the Hebrew law of the priesthood. This is excessively improbable, even with a late author of the second century, who evidently knew as much concerning Judaea and its history as the author of the Fourth Gospel did indubitably possess. It is enough that the evangelist singles out "that memorable year" (Lucke, Meyer and Lunge, etc.) of the death of Christ; and remarks on the man who was holding the position at this solemn time, with obvious reference to the fact that now for many years the functions of the high priest were discharged only at the pleasure of the Roman governor, who might, as Caiaphas himself said, abolish the office altogether if he chose arbitrarily to do so. The first words of Caiaphas, "Ye know nothing at all," are brusque, rough, imperious, but are quite akin to what we know elsewhere of the manners of the man (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 14), and of the aristocratic clique of which he was the head.

If, thought he, the multitudes accept this Sabbath-breaker, this Worker of miracles, this religious Enthusiast, this moral Reformer, for their Messiah, the Romans will crush the movement, will stamp out the entire religious order; "we" shall be annihilated as a power, the "nation" will be abolished as such.

Hengstenberg identifies it with "Baal-hazor, which is by Ephraim" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a>).

The intelligence must have reached our Lord that the Sanhedrin had formally pronounced sentence against him. This may have induced him to retire from Jerusalem until the next great feast, when he would publicly challenge their allegiance.

The country people must have been faithful to him, and the edicts were issued rather to intimidate the people than to secure the immediate end; but they were quite sufficient to excite the inquiries of Galilaeans and others who had gone to Jerusalem for the main purpose of seeing him. The interdict had been aimed probably at the family of Bethany, which was clearly one of some consequence, or against any household in Jerusalem which should harbor him. It may have been the occasion which stirred the devilish spirit in the mind of Judas. So long as Jesus was surrounded with an enthusiastic crowd, they dared not seize his person. They resolved on secrecy, but were bent on public humiliation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/12.htm"><title>John 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/11.htm" title="John 11">&#9668;</a> John 12 <a href="../john/13.htm" title="John 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The feast of love and gratitude</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore, six days before the Passover.</span> Every preliminary of that solemn feast is memorable to our evangelist. The coincidence of the Passover feast and the killing of the Paschal lamb, with the sacrifice of "Christ our Passover," cannot be concealed. [For the grammatical construction with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, cf. note, <a href="../../par/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a>, where a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> occurs; not, however, a Latinism, as some have supposed, as similar phrases are found in good Greek (see Winer, ' Greek Gram.,' p. 69).] The date from which the calculation is made is complicated with the intricate controversy upon the day of our Lord's death, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he suffered on the 14th or 15th of Nisan, and whether a "harmony" is possible or not with the statements of the synoptists, who all three assert that our Lord ate the Passover with his disciples (see Introduction, pp. 92-94.). However this matter be finally settled, if the 14th of Nisan was the day on which the Passover was killed, "between the evenings," the 13th was reckoned as the first day before the Passover, and the sixth day would be the 8th of Nisan. If the weekly sabbath occurred on the 16th, then the 9th also was a sabbath. The Lord would then have reached Bethany on the <span class="accented">eve</span> of the sabbath, and have rested on the sabbath itself. The evening of the 9th would be the occasion of the feast, and the 10th would correspond with Palm Sunday. If the Lord were crucified on the 14th, and the weekly sabbath coincided with the Passover-day of convocation, the 15th, then the previous sabbath was on the 8th, and our Lord must have reached Bethany in "the end of the sabbath," and then the feast was on the following day. When Jesus halted at Bethany, the vast crowd of pilgrims advanced into the suburbs of Jerusalem, encamping on the Mount of Olives, and would be ready for the great demonstration of the next day. Westcott, after Bengel, observes that John's Gospel begins and ends with a sacred week (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-35, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1</a>). <span class="accented">Jesus therefore, sis days before the Passover, <span class="cmt_word"></span>came to Bethany</span>. The quiet rest of that last sabbath with the family at Bethany is a thought full of suggestion. Thoma accounts for the triumphal feast and anointing, "six days before the Passover," as answering to the day on which the lamb was separated from other and secular animals, and consecrated for this holy service (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>). The segregation, however, was partial or premature, and the anointing (see below) took place five days before the Passover. It is not said that the day of his arrival at Bethany is the day of the festive welcome. Bethany is described as <span class="cmt_word">the place where Lazarus was.</span> The explanatory clause, <span class="cmt_word">he who had been dead</span>, is not necessary, as the evangelist limits and explains sufficiently the great motive for his pause and presence at Bethany by adding, <span class="cmt_word">whom he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">raised from the dead.</span> It is extraordinary that some most able expositors should be so unwilling to accept the synchronous statements of the synoptists. Their narrative is not out of harmony with the hypothesis that our Lord passed the previous days with the pilgrim-band from Peraea, and that, taking the head of the procession as it was passing through Jericho., he should thus have distinctly challenged the authorities, and taken up the public position to which they were anxious he should lay claim. By his visit to the house of Zacchaeus he proclaimed the new feature and spirit of his kingdom; by healing the blind man he gave a typical illustration of the work of grace needed by all his disciples; by resting at the home where human love and Divine power had been so wonderfully blended he called the most solemn attention to his supreme claims; by pressing on with urgency up the steep mountain pathway at the head of his disciples he seemed to be ready, in his own words, "to lay down his life, that he might take it again." The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, according to Meyer, is simply the resumption of the narrative, but surely those are right who regard it as a distinct reference to <a href="../../par/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>. The Sanhedrists had given the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> that if any knew where he was, they should declare it. Christ was resolved, now that his hour was come, to lift the whole responsibility from his friends, and <span class="accented">take</span> it upon himself. The other evangelists do not mention the halt. Their purpose was not a chronological one. They give the narrative of the anointing apart from its deepest meanings and consequences, apart from any references to Lazarus (see <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-12</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1-11</a>). There are other subtle omissions from the synoptists, the difficulties of which must be settled as <span class="accented">between themselves</span>. Thus, according to <a href="../../par/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a> and 20, an interval of a whole day and night took place between the withering of the fig tree and the conversation about it, but Matthew makes the conversation follow immediately upon the miracle. In like manner, John abstains from any reference to the discussions in the temple, to the withering of the fig tree, to the cleansing of the temple, or to the parables which followed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There, therefore, they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him</span>. John does not tell us in whose house "they made the dinner" or supper, and unless Simon the leper (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) is a member of the family (or, as some suggest, the husband of Martha), we cannot suppose that it was in the quiet home of Bethany that this feast in honor of Jesus was held, but that it took place, as the synoptists positively declare, "in the house of Simon the leper." Simon may easily have been one of the many lepers whom our Lord had healed, and whose soul was filled with accordant gratitude. At that table there would be seated two transcendent; proofs of the power of Jesus to save, not only from the semblance but from the reality of death (see Meyer; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>). We wonder, with Godet, that Meyer should reject this simple supposition as "spurious harmony." All that is here stated is in agreement with it: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Martha should have shown her reverence by serving her  Lord, according to her wont, not necessarily as hostess (Hengstenberg and Lange), but as the expression of her devoted thankfulness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Lazarus should have been one of those who sat at meat, reclined at table, with him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> took a position as a guest, like himself; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that Mary should have poured forth her costly spikenard, in royal self-forgetting love. The conduct of all the three thus mentioned is compatible with the fact stated in the synoptic narrative, that the festival was celebrated in the house of Simon the leper. Our Lord had commented, in the house of Simon the Pharisee (<a href="../../par/luke/7-44.htm">Luke 7:44</a>, etc.), on the absence of the customary anointing with oil. Mary knew of this, and resolved that, whatever the woman who was a sinner had done, no similar act of neglect should occur on that memorable evening. A chronological discrepancy renders an identification of the synoptic narrative of Matthew with this story perplexing. In <a href="../../par/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a> we are brought to within two days of the Passover, whereas here we cannot well be less than five days before it. However, there is nothing in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-13</a> which indubitably declares the date of the <span class="accented">supper</span> The "two days" may refer to the date of Judas's treachery, after mentioning which he goes back to an event which furnished occasion and temptation to the avaricious mind of Judas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mary therefore took a pound</span> (the synoptists Matthew and Mark say "an alabaster," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a flask made of the costly spar, which was peculiarly adapted to the preservation of liquid perfume, hermetically sealed before it was broken for immediate use. The fact, as stated by Matthew and Mark, is inconsistent with her reserving any of the precious fluid for another occasion) <span class="cmt_word">of ointment</span> ("liquid perfume," sometimes added to the more ordinary oil), <span class="cmt_word">of pure</span> (or possibly; <span class="accented">pistie</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>nard</span>. Mark uses this unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which belongs to later Greek. The derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, equivalent to "potable," is not appropriate in meaning, though this "nard" was used for perfuming wine. In <a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> also the Authorized Version translates it "spikenard," as it does here (cf. also <a href="../../par/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a> and Song 4:13, 14, where Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). But the one place where the word was supposed to be found in Aristotle is now seen not to be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, trustworthy, or unadulterated. It is possible that the word may have had a local geographical value, belonging to some proper name, and is untranslatable. <span class="cmt_word">Very precious.</span> Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, and Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. John appears to combine the idea of both words in his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Each of the synoptists severally mentions a fact which John omits - that Mary <span class="accented">broke</span> the alabaster box, and poured the costly unguent on his head in rich abundance, as though hers had been the royal or high-priestly anointing (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>.); but John shows that this at least was not all she did. <span class="cmt_word">She anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span> Thoma thinks that, conformably with John's idea, the anointing of the head of the true High Priest was the work of God alone, quoting Philo's comment on <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, etc., "The head of the Logos, as High Priest, is anointed with oil, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his innermost essence gleams with dazzling light;" and adds, that as the feet of the high priest were washed with water from recent defilement of the world's dust, so God's anointed Lamb and Priest was anointed on his feet with the spikenard of faith, the best and costliest thing that man could offer. So profound an analogy seems to us contrary to the simplicity of the narrative, which is perfectly natural in its form. The perfumed nard ran down to the Savior's feet and the skirts of his garments, and there accumulating, the significant act is further recounted how Mary wiped off the superfluous perfume from his feet with the tresses of her loosened hair. This simple act proclaimed the self-humiliation and adoration of her unbounded love, seeing that the loosening of a woman's hair was a mark of unusual self-abandonment, Many most unnecessary inferences have been drawn from this. John adds an interesting feature, revealing the sensitive eye-witness of the scene, "and the house <span class="accented">was filled with the odor of the ointment</span>;" and the whole house of God ever since has been fragrant with her immortal and prophetic act. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, which should betray him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Judas the Iscariot, one of his disciples</span><span class="cmt_word">, who was about to betray him, said.</span> The speaker here is singled out by name. Matthew refers the speech to the disciples generally, in whom the suggestion of Judas had stirred up (without guile or blame on their part) a not unnatural inquiry. Mark says "some" murmured to themselves, "Why this waste?" (loss, destruction). John (without the malice which Renan has attributed to the writer) mentions the source of the suggestion, "Judas Iscariot, Simon's son." The word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, contained in T.R., is omitted here in the best texts. The fact that he was the traitor, being one of the well-known and awful events of the gospel history when John wrote some half a century later, might well be introduced by the evangelist, with no other than a purely historical motive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-5.htm">John 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span> Sinful motive often hides itself under the mask of reverence for another virtue. In Mark's Gospel the same price was put upon the pound of pure nard as that which is mentioned here - about  of our money. Christ had given emphatic advice about generosity to the poor, and even during this very week (<a href="../../par/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>) it is clear that his words were not forgotten, and in his great discourse, probably also delivered during this same week, he identified himself with the poor (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, etc.), and called for unreserved consideration of them; so that this language was not unnatural. The value of this ointment is another minute indication that there is no connection between the Lazarus of John and the Lazarus of the parable. But John adds that the utter lack of perception on Judas's part of Mary's self-devotion was prompted by the most unworthy motive. The suggestion of Judas is put down by the evangelist to the sheerest covetousness. During the interval that elapsed, Judas had revealed his character, and John did not hesitate to refer the suggestion to the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor</span>. He really cared nothing for the poor. He was ambitious, eager for the display of the Master's power, anxious for the rewards which might follow the Master's assumption of supreme authority, turning to his own account all that might happen. <span class="cmt_word">But because he was a thief, and having</span> <span class="cmt_word">possession of the common purse</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in the sense of a chest (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), has a curious etymology, which had passed out of recognition; from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> comes <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, that in which month-pieces of flutes might be kept in safety, and subsequently a chest or box for the safe guardianship of other valuables), <span class="cmt_word">he was the bearer</span> - perhaps, <span class="accented">bore array</span> (see <a href="../../par/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>, and Josephus, ' Ant.,' 7:15. 3, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>), at all events had at his disposal - <span class="cmt_word">of the things which were cast</span>, in generous profusion, into it. Thoma makes the astounding suggestion that "John" here covertly refers to Simon Magus of <a href="../../par/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18</a>, etc. The question is often asked - Why was Judas entrusted with the common purse? Was it not likely to aggravate a disposition to which he was prone? Did not Jesus know what was in man? and had he not discerned the propensity of Judas (see <a href="../../par/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>)? In reply: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The appointment may have been made by the apostles themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our Lord may not have interfered with it, deeming confidence more likely to help him than distrust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It may also show how, if men will yield themselves to sin, God will not and does not promise them immunity from temptation, but sometimes even brings them into it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The purse might have been a preservative against the vile temptation to sell his Master, and a test and motive for self-con-quest.

This is, in one sense, that very day, and she has found out the solemn fact in a way in which the disciples had as yet failed to do. With this agrees the language of the synoptists," Why trouble ye the woman? she hath wrought a good work on me;...  she hath done that which was possible to her (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)" of <a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>. In fact, Mark expressly conveys this thought - "she has anticipated the anointing of my body for the burial."  If we have the direct testimony of Mark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Peter), Christ must have expressed himself thus.  Matthew also in different words records the same pathetic and subtle thought: "For in that she poured [cast] this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial" (John 26:12) Hengstenberg, Godet, and Stier abide by the reading of the T.R.; but the principal manuscripts, in most powerful combination, have led Lachmann, Alford, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort to read here, <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "In order that she may keep or guard this for the day of my burial." Westcott says that the synoptists imply rather, by the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, that She had not already consumed the whole of the ointment. Meyer, with this text, translates, "Let her alone, that she may preserve it (this ointment, of which she has just poured some over my feet) for the day of my embalmment." This certainly seems inconsistent with the complaint of the disciples or of Judas, at the apparently superfluous expenditure, and would compel us to restrict the <span class="accented">abed to</span> the unused portion. The advocates of the T.R. reading say that it represents the original text, which has been altered by criticism arising from misunderstanding of the idea of the day of burial having ideally arrived; but why did they not alter on the same principle the language of the synoptists? The advocates of Lachmann's text say that it has been altered by copyists, to bring it into accord with the text of the synoptists. Lange justifies the Revised Version, "Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying," and puts it thus: "Permit her to keep it [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to have kept the ointment which she might have used at the burial of Lazarus] for the day of my burial," now ideally present in the outbreak of Judas's devilish malignity. So virtually Luthardt and Baumgarten-Crusius. Godet argues that this is forced and ungrammatical. But there is this advantage in it, that it brings the language into much closer relation with the synoptists. Westcott prefers the idea of Meyer. The older view is to me far mere satisfactory. Edersheim (2:35) adds to this, "Mary may have had that alabaster box from early days, before she had learned to serve Christ. When she understood that <span class="accented">decease</span> of which he constantly spake, she may have put it aside, "kept it," "against the day of his burying." And now the decisive hour is come.

As though he had said, "After this very night, the opportunity to offer me affectionate attention or symbolic homage, to give expression to feelings in accordance with just presentiments as to my mission, will be over forever, and belong to the irrecoverable past - <span class="accented">Now</span> <span class="accented">or never!</span> She has done this thing, she will have everlasting remembrance thereby." The frankincense of the Wise Men, the ointment of Mary, the homage of the Greeks, were symbols, and can never be repeated. The greatest motive for generous and affectionate interest in the poor is that they represent the Lord; but they are not to be rivals of the Lord himself. Westcott remarks, "The promise of the future record of the act of love is omitted by the one evangelist who gives the name of the woman who showed this devotion to her Master." Moulton, "The very charity that cares for the poor whom we see has been kept alive by faith in and devotion to the crucified Redeemer whom we cannot see."

We gather from the synoptic narrative that he had joined the pilgrim-throng, advancing first into Jericho, and then, after a night spent there, had moved onwards to Bethany. The dispersion of hundreds of these excited followers into Jerusalem had again bruited abroad the fact of the resurrection of Lazarus, and, by reason of the Lord's return to Bethany, the Jerusalem-party at length learned where he was. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> shows an antithesis intended between the Judaean and the Galilean crowds.

And now the hour had come (<a href="../../par/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>), but not until our Lord once more warned the disciples with intense significance and explicitness of his approaching death and burial. Thus another striking illustration is given of the judgment, the <span class="accented">crisis</span>, the sifting process, which is always going on in the presence of Christ. His greatest signs, his wisest teachings, his most amazing love, bring out the twofold result. Some receive, some reject, some burst into louder acclaim, some try to slay. As with the history of this "Gospel," some hear in it the very voice of the Eternal, but there are others who would grind it to powder. Because Ignatius and Polycarp bear witness to the existence of the Gospel, these Lazaruses must be put to death, or banished to a later period out of harm's way. Even the genuineness of the Apocalypse, so long a tower of defense for the T&uuml;bingen school, is too powerful a proof of St. John's residence in Asia to be accepted with equanimity or left in possession, and some of the later critics have taken counsel to repudiate its Johannine authorship.

(On the differences between John's account of this transaction and that of the synoptic narrative, cf. commentaries, <a href="../../par/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-44</a>.) On the precise order of events it is difficult to speak with absolute decision. The main difference between the synoptists and John is in the break at Bethany of the journey from Jericho to Jerusalem, to introduce a feast, which is related afterwards by the synoptists, though not <span class="accented">limited</span> by them to any later chronological position. It should be observed, moreover, that the synoptic narrative contains numerous references to the residence in Bethany during several days of the week (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) which followed. John adds important details, and while he omits the great discussions in the temple, the withering of the fig tree, the cleansing of the temple, the parables of the judgments on scribes and Pharisees, and the prophecy of the future, he portrays the inner life of the Lord, and records his most gracious esoteric teaching and sublime prayer. The current tradition of the Church, the distinct note of time for Christ's arrival at Bethany (six days before the Passover), make the triumphal entry take place on Sunday afternoon (cf. ver. 1) of Passion week. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The next day</span> (on the morrow) must be the day after the feast. We have seen that that feast probably took place on the evening of the sabbath. The events that happened are far more abundantly described in Matthew, Mark, and Luke - the excitement in Jerusalem, the method in which the triumph was carried through, the mode adopted to secure "the young ass," the weeping ever Jerusalem from the summit of the hill; none of these circumstances are inconsistent with this account. Brief, however, as our narrative is, it adds some features which are peculiar and highly historic. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">vast crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</span> These that had come from the country, and had already encamped near or in Jerusalem, came group after group to Bethany to escort him into the city. The synoptists, not mentioning the pause of the sabbath at Bethany, and not clearly indicating where and when the feast at Bethany took place, naturally connect the journey from Jericho with the entrance into Jerusalem. John explains, in addition, that there were of the Jerusalemites themselves certain who had been led to go to Bethany and throw in their lot with the Lord. The early pilgrims mentioned in <a href="../../par/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55, 56</a>, also came forth from the city to hail and welcome his approach. Took branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him. The synoptists had mentioned that the triumphant host had cut "branches," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>), from the trees, and Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>) had said <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, fragments of trees, grass, small branches, that could be strewn in the way. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/19-35.htm">Luke 19:35</a>) simply mentions the <span class="accented">garments</span> thus strewn - a fact mentioned also by Mark and Matthew. Our narrative gives greater definiteness, and even adds a new feature, by speaking of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the palm branches of the palm trees," which they waved probably in triumph, as they had been accustomed to do in token of the approach of a conqueror (cf. 1 Macc. 13:51, where Simon's return to the city was celebrated with "thanksgiving and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and with harps and cymbals," etc.). The use to which the branches of the well-known palm trees were put, differs from, but does not exclude, the use to which <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were also put. Bethany (see note, <a href="../../par/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1</a>) was "the house of dates," and the palm branches for the Feast of Tabernacles, on its first celebration after the Captivity (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), Were fetched from <span class="accented">the</span> mount (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). The palm tree was a sacred symbol for Israel "Tamar," a palm <span class="accented">tree</span>, was a favorite name for a woman. The Maccabaean coins were decorated with the palm and vine. The medal struck by Titus represented a captive sitting under a palm. Throughout their history, in their gorgeous temple ritual, it continually reappears, and at the last the Apocalypse represents the victorious songs of triumphant elders accompanied by the waving of the palm. If we compare the four accounts of the demonstration, we shall see again how in combination they vividly represent the whole scene. The multitude cry, according to - <a href="../../par/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>: "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest." <a href="../../par/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9, 10</a>: "Hosanna; Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest." <a href="../../par/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38</a>, remembering the angel's song: "They praised God with a loud voice....  Blessed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord: in heaven peace, and glory in the highest." John says they went forth to meet him, palm branch in hand, and cried, <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, and</span> (blessed be) <span class="cmt_word">(even) the King of Israel.</span> These differences show how various groups used with freedom the tones and sentiment of the hundred and eighteenth psalm, adopting the welcome with which the priests were accustomed to greet the pilgrims to the festival. But each account demonstrates that, on this occasion, there was a general ascription to our Lord of Messianic honor. He is hailed by the people as King of Israel, as the Head of the coming kingdom of their father David, and as giving glory to God. <span class="accented">The Name of the Lord</span> is the manifestation and compendium of all the perfections of the Lord. For centuries the gracious hope had rung forth in the sacred liturgy, and now the people see that the hope is on the point of realization.

The foal implies that the animal had never borne another burden. The account of Matthew refers to the mother and the foal, as though they were inseparable, and together bore the sacred burden. Mr. Holman Hunt, in his picture of the 'Triumph of the Innocents,' has represented the beast bearing Mary and her Child as accompanied by the colt. The entire process of securing both must have taken time, and augmented the excitement. Christ at length, on the eve of his Passion which he so distinctly foreshadowed, allowed the enthusiasm of the people to prevail, and accepted the homage. The Galilee pilgrims take up the demonstration, which was commenced, as we see from John's Gospel, by "the Jews" and those Jerusalemites who had been profoundly moved by the significance of the resurrection of Lazarus. The circumstances thus elucidated from the four narratives, reveal undesigned coincidences. The entry into Jerusalem did not take place till the afternoon, and so we find that all that our Lord did on arrival was to "go to the temple, look round on all things, and, now that the even was come, to revisit Bethany with the twelve" (<a href="../../par/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - John, as well as Matthew, sees here a symbolical fulfillment of what had been declared by one of the latest of the prophets, as the peculiarity of the Messiah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>): <span class="cmt_word">Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt</span>. This oracle is admitted by commentators of opposite schools to refer to the Messiah. There was no need, in order to fulfill the spirit of the whole passage, that the King should come to his own <span class="accented">literally</span> upon the back of a beast of burden. The prophecy does, however, suggest the modesty, the absence of all pomp or display of worldly wealth and power; nay, the humiliation on the part of the true King. Both Matthew and John omit the characteristics of "righteous and saved," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "delivered" from the hands of his cruel enemies. The suffering Servant of God of the great oracle of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. was in the mind of the Prophet Zechariah, and he adds this feature to the triumphant coming of the true Prince of Peace, that he would "cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so act that even the national pride and power and military prowess should come to an end; "Speak peace to the nations; rule from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth." As John and Matthew both see the symbolical fulfillment of the prophecy, they doubtless would have us bear in mind the whole passage. John transforms the "Rejoice greatly, shout," etc., of the prophet into "<span class="accented">Fear not</span>." He seems to take it at one stage only of fulfillment, when anxiety might momentarily be put to rest. The "<span class="accented">Fear</span> not" is a lower form of "great rejoicing." It is something for men to dismiss their doubts and hush their unrest, even when they cannot burst into song. Hengstenberg and Godet urge that the "meekness and lowliness" to which the prophet referred, and which Matthew cited from him, was imaged in the lowly beast on which never man sat. But it must not be forgotten that the ass was used by distinguished personages (<a href="../../par/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-26.htm">2 Samuel 19:26</a>). And all that was really meant by it was the choice of a creature associated rather with daily life than with military display. Meyer and Moulton urge that it was a chosen symbol of peace (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> substituted for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> of the LXX. and <a href="../../par/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). Contrary to Keim's animadversion, our Lord and his disciples adopted here the idea of a Jewish Messiah, stripping it of its worldly characteristics. It should be observed that, while John's narrative is in harmony with the synoptists, he greatly abbreviates it.

Hengstenberg thinks here is a hint of some medium of communication between John and the Pharisees, and imagines it to be found through Martha and Simon (her husband). Their language was, <span class="cmt_word">Perceive</span> [ye] - or, <span class="accented">ye perceive</span> (either imperative or indicative) - <span class="cmt_word">that ye prevail nothing</span>! The interrogative may also be a true translation. <span class="accented">Do ye perceive that ye prevail nothing?</span> On either hypothesis, it cannot be, as Chrysostom says, the language of the friends of Jesus among the Pharisees, but rather the cry of despair and rage. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">world has gone away after him.</span> They are repenting that they had not followed out the coercive plans and murderous designs of Caiaphas, and had been content with half-measures.

They went up with a view to worship in the feast, that is, there were burnt offerings and thank offerings which they were allowed to present. This shows that they were not heathen nor uncircumcised Hellenists, whichever view of that word be accepted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a></div><div class="verse">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus</span>. The first expression of that great yearning which, swollen by multitudes without number, is loud as the voice of many waters and mighty thunderings. It is the wail of every penitent; it is the birth-cry of every renewed soul; it is the raptured burst of joy as each son of God passes behind the veil The "therefore" implies some kind of previous relation with <span class="accented">Philip</span>, whose somewhat timid, cautious, speculative mind, as hinted in the earlier portions of the Gospel, made him accessible to them. Personal acquaintance is, of course, possible. Was Philip identical with the Aristion of Papias (see Introduction, p. 34, and Archdeacon Farrar, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, November, 1881)? The mention of Bethsaida of Galilee confirms the suggestion that they were inhabitants of one of the Greek cities of Decapolis, or of the slopes of the Lebanon. Many commentators refer to Philip's Greek name as indicating proclivities or sympathies on his part which would make him peculiarly accessible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a></div><div class="verse">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The slight modification of text preferred by the Revised Version gives great vivacity to the picture (see below, note 1). Philip receives the respectful request of the Greeks, "Sir [my lord], we would see Jesus," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "converse with." They probably sought to bring some proposal before him. Surely they must have had, if they wished it, many opportunities of merely <span class="accented">seeing</span> Jesus, when he crossed the Mount of Olivet during those three days, or tarried in the court of the Gentiles; now they pressed for an interview. <span class="cmt_word">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew.</span> Andrew was the earliest of the disciples, who brought his own brother Simon to Jesus (<a href="../../par/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>). He is mentioned as in close association with Simon, James, and John, as partners with them in the fishing-trade on the lake of Galilee (see <a href="../../par/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16, 29</a>, and Mark 3:18, compared with <a href="../../par/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). There is some hint that Andrew and John, after the first call to become followers of Christ, clung to him, and went with him to Jerusalem, and then returned with him through Samaria, after which occurred the second call of the brothers <span class="accented">Simon</span> and <span class="accented">James</span>. The frequent references to Andrew and Philip in this Gospel correspond with the tradition preserved in the <span class="accented">Muratorian Fragment on the Canon</span>, touching Andrew's part in the composition of this Gospel. These two disciples are represented as consulting with each other on previous occasions, as though peculiarly related in sympathy. Philip sees certain difficulties, and Andrew has a practical mind, and proposes a way out of them (see <a href="../../par/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7, 8</a>). There was something now to be said on both sides. Their ancient prophecies anticipated a world-wide aspect of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3, 7</a>; as well as <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Now, if this incident occurred after Jesus had claimed the hundred and tenth psalm as an oracle which described his own Divine claims and his universal victory as the Lord and Son of David and royal Warrior-Prest (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>, and parallel passages), Philip may have felt this moment to be a most critical one in his history; for he may have been perfectly aware of the outbreak of peril which converse with Greek proselytes might at that moment have provoked in the minds of the turbulent populace. <span class="cmt_word">Andrew cometh and Philip, and they</span> (together) <span class="cmt_word">tell Jesus</span>. Jesus alone could solve the difficulty at that time, and Jesus himself is the just and reasonable Source of all enlightenment. Jesus is at this hour the highest Expression of man and his destiny, and he is also the perfect Manifestation of the Father, the only Mediator between God and man, absolutely one with both. We still go to him to know what God is and what God would have us to think and to be, and to learn what man may become. We take to him the puzzles of our logic, the accusations of our conscience, and the burdens of our heart. Additional interest is thrown round this narrative by a suggestion of Archdeacon Watkins, that, in the course of this week, our Lord had cleansed the temple and courts of its profane traffic, and declared it to be a <span class="accented">house of prayer for all nations</span>. Such grand revolutionary conceptions as those of our Lord must have deeply stirred the souls of the susceptible Greeks. Aliens were, as we know from Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11.5), forbidden to pass beyond the balustrade round the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,. M. Ganneau has found among the ruins of Jerusalem one of the slabs of stone which recorded this exclusion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-26.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The glorification of the Son of man in and through death</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus answereth</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. Many commentators (Ewald, Godet, Hengstenberg) think that Jesus did not address the following words to the Greeks, that until he had gone through the agony of death, and entered in human nature on his Divine and mediatorial reign, the mission to the Gentiles could not commence. Tholuck supposed that the interview was over, and that the solemn words are addressed to the disciples in the presence both of Greeks and of others <span class="accented">afterwards</span>; but there is no such break suggested. It is more probable (with Luthardt, Edersheim, Lunge) that the Greeks were close behind Andrew and Philip, and that our Lord at once, for <span class="accented">their</span> advantage, as well as for that of the disciples, proceeded to explain the solemn impression made upon himself by this remarkable desire. Surely it is unnecessary to say that our Lord was anxious not to give umbrage to the priests, or to rouse the animosity of the people. Every word of the terrible address of <a href="../../par/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, all the controversies in the temple, even the triumphal entry itself, would and did give mortal umbrage to the priestly party and to the Sanhedrim He had boldly challenged their entire position, he had smitten down their prejudices and assailed their notions of exclusive privilege, and therefore would not have shrunk, on that ground, from intercourse with devout Greeks worshipping at the feast. The words are surely said <span class="accented">to</span> them and <span class="accented">about</span> them, but in the main for the instruction of the disciples themselves. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is come</span> for which he had been waiting (see <a href="../../par/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>)-the mysterious "hour" on which his glory would depend, and the destiny of the world turn. God not only contemplates great periods, eons of time, but "acceptable years," "days of the Lord," "moments of time," as parts of the eternal plan. That the Son of man should be glorified. The "Son of man," rather than "Son of God," is the term he uses in reference to, and in the presence of, the Greeks. The highest Man is now about to assume his supreme glory, to go forth, as the mighty Man, to rule the world of men. The Son of man is about to ascend into his eternal throne, to clothe himself with all authority of judgment and mercy in heaven and earth. The glorification of the Son of man is one of the high main themes of the Gospel, and its justification is to be found in the fact that the Son of man is indeed the Logos made flesh, and the Lamb slain, and like the Serpent is being lifted up, and as the true Shepherd is laying down his life that he might take it again. The advent of the Greeks opens prophetic vistas which involve tremendous experiences of his own, and also great principles of service for all his followers. His Passion was so inextricably interwoven with his glory, that the former becomes verily the prelude of his victory and supreme exaltation. His death is but his glory. Moreover, the approach of the Gentiles suggested the universal belief in him which would follow upon his Passion and resurrection, and he" foretells that the hour of his glorification was already come" (Augustine). (See remarks in Introduction, pp. 78-80, on the several epochs in this record of the Lord's life, where the "hour" seems to strike, but is again and again postponed with a view to fresh revelations, exactly as the climax is deferred throughout the Apocalypse.)

"Even nature protests against the Hellenic fear of death" (Lange). As long as the corn of wheat is scrupulously kept from decomposition and death in the granary, the hidden germ is dormant; let it be sown as "bare grain" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-36.htm">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>, etc.), then the strange force within it puts forth its hidden faculty, the outer covering of this point of energy falls away, and the new thing appears. God gives it a body, and much fruit is brought forth. Thoma suggests that the Johannist here is putting into the lips of Jesus the thoughts of Paul. How much more probable is it that Paul grasped the thought of Jesus, and applied a part of it to the grand argument for the resurrection, both of Christ and Christians! Compare with this the teaching of <a href="../../par/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, where the Bread of life is given for the food of men. Even the "bread-making" for man involves, in another way, the temporary destruction of the living germ in the grain of which it is composed, that it may become the life of men. Christ is himself the "Son of God," the "Logos incarnate," the "Son of man." By becoming, in his death, the food of man's soul, he created thus a new life in the hearts of men. Over and over again our Lord has declared himself to be "the Life," and "the Source of life," for men; but he here lays down the principle that this life-giving power of his is conditioned by his death. The great  harvest will be reaped only when he shall have sacrificed his life and put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. It is, too, only as every believing man dies to himself, is crucified with Christ, is dead with him to the world, that he rises again in the newness of life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - The Lord here introduces a solemn, almost oracular utterance, which proves how close and intimate is the relationship between the synoptics and the Fourth Gospel. On several great occasions our Lord has impressed this law of the Spirit of life upon his disciples. Thus in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37-39</a>, in the lengthened commission given to the twelve, after calling on his followers to place his own claim on their affection as greater than that of father, mother, friend, and calling for self-sacrifice, and self-crucifixion, he said, "He that findeth his life (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>) shall lose it: he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." Again (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>, etc.), after rebuking Peter for his unwillingness to recognize the necessity and significance of the killing of "the Son of the living God," he laid down the same law once more, calling for self-denial and daily cross-bearing, and adds, "Whosoever will <span class="accented">save</span> his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it." So also <a href="../../par/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, etc. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/15-26.htm">Luke 15:26</a>) also introduces the same solemn aphorism in our Lord's discourse concerning the close of the Jewish national life. Surely here he is applying to his own case the law of the Divine life which he had shown to be universal, and of which he was on the point of giving the crowning and climacteric expression. He does it with amplifications and a supply of motives. If life be regarded as an end in itself; if it be treated as complete when rounded with its own individuality; if life shrink from sacrifice, if it "love itself," and will at all hazards preserve itself; if the natural and instinctive fear of death, and instinct of self-preservation, become a self-idolatry; - that life will "abide alone." If it sacrifice itself for higher ends than self; if it regard the higher end as more valuable than itself; if it lose itself in the object to which it is consecrated; if it be content to "die;" - it abideth no longer "alone," but "bringeth forth much fruit." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loves his own life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>); life used as equivalent to "self," in that totality of being which, like the life of the seed-corn, survives the accident of death  - <span class="cmt_word">he that loves his own life</span> (<span class="accented">self</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word">is</span> losing</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>; or, perhaps, destroying it, <span class="accented">ipso facto</span>. There are ends and objects of love so much greater than" the self," that to keep it by some act of will and recreant fear is to make it utterly valueless, is really to destroy its true vitality. <span class="cmt_word">And he that hateth his</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">life</span> (<span class="accented">self</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in this world</span>, wherever the greater claim of Christ and of the Father would be compromised by loving it, <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> veritably <span class="cmt_word">preserve it</span>, viz. the self, <span class="cmt_word">unto eternal</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the blessedness of eternal being. The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is a great possession; and "what advantageth a man if he should gain the whole world, and lose it?" But if a man persists in gaining the world, and forgets that this earthly existence is not capable of satisfying the demands or finding a sphere for the true self, and so makes the earthly reign or enjoyment of the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> the end of all striving, - then he miserably fails. So far it is clear that our Lord is applying a great principle of the true life to the case of his own Messianic work and ministry. He draws, from a law of the superiority of the Divine life to the fear of death and to the fact of death, a justification of his own approaching doom. He can only by dying live his perfect life, win his greatest triumph; reap his world-wide harvest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a></div><div class="verse">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i>my</i> Father honour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - In this verse the Lord brings the light of heaven down into this deep paradox. He speaks like an anointed King and great Captain of salvation, who has (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) "servants" willing to do his bidding. <span class="cmt_word">If any man will be my servant, let him follow me</span> along the line which I am prepared to take, in the way of sacrifice and death, which is the true glorification; <span class="cmt_word">and where I am, there shall also my servant be</span>. This association of the servant with the Lord, as the sufficient and the transcendent motive, pervades the Gospels (cf. <a href="../../par/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a> and John 17:24; comp. also <a href="../../par/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>, "with me in Paradise;" and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). It is remarkable that Christ chose the twelve that they should be "with him" (<a href="../../par/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>). There is no greater blessedness. Still, the Lord adds, <span class="cmt_word">If any man serve me, him will the Father honor.</span> For the Father to honor a poor child of the dust seems almost more than we can receive. The conception of the steps by means of which the Lord makes this possible to his followers and servants produced in his own self-consciousness one of those sudden and overwhelming crises and changes from joy to perturbation, as of agony to peace and to reconcilement with the eternal Father's will, which prove how certainly St. John is always portraying the same Personage, the same transcendent character whom the synoptists describe (<a href="../../par/luke/12-49.htm">Luke 12:49, 50</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, etc., and 21). More than this, the whole passage that follows is a solemn prelude to that agony of the garden which the synoptists alone record, while they omit this. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a></div><div class="verse">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?

In <a href="../../par/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a> we hear that he troubled himself, and shuddered wrathfully in his "spirit" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) at the contemplation of all the evils and curse of death; now his whole <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his life centered in its corporeal environment as a man, the self which the Son of God had taken up into the Divine essence, was in depth of agony, preluding the strong crying and tears to which <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> refers. These perturbations of his soul and spirit can only be accounted for by the uniqueness of his Personality, the capacity for suffering, and the extent to which he was identifying himself with the sinful nature with which he had invested himself. Sin is the sting of death. He had by the nature of his incarnation become sin for us. Martyrs, freed from sin, delivered from its curse and shame and power through him, face it with calmness and hope; but there was infinite space in his breast for all the curse of it to rain its horrible tempest. He felt that the hour of his extremest travail had come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And what shall I</span> (must I) <span class="cmt_word">say</span>? What is the regal passion of my heart? What is the right revelation for me to make to you? What is the prayer for me to offer to the Father? It remains a great question whether the next utterance is the primary answer of the question itself, or whether it continues the interrogation - whether, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Lord lifts up for a moment the cry of heart-rending grief, <span class="accented">Father, save me from this hour!</span> or whether he said, <span class="accented">Shall I say, Father, save me from this hour?</span> The first view supposes in the first place actual uncertainty and awful bewilderment, and then a most intense cry (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to him who was able to save him from death. Save me either from the death itself, or from the fear and horror which accompanies it (Lucke, Meyer, Hengstenberg, and Moulton). <span class="accented">It</span> need not be a prayer to leave the world unsaved, to sacrifice all the work on which he had come. We are told by the apostle (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) that he was "heard" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and delivered from human weakness which might have rebelled in the intolerable darkness of that hour. <span class="cmt_word">Father, save me from this hour</span>; the equivalent to the prayer, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," with its grand "nevertheless," etc. If this be its meaning, we have a scene nearly, if not closely, identifiable with the agony of the garden. The correction which immediately follows augments the comparison with the scene in Gethsemane recorded by the synoptists. The R.T. and Revised Version have put their note of interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> into the margin, and not into the text. Ewald, Lange, Kling, Tholuck, Lachmann, accept this punctuation, and Godet regards it as an hypothetical prayer, although he does not place the interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The self-interrogation of the previous utterance at least reveals the presence of such a desire, but one which vanishes as the mysterious hour engulfs and wraps him round. If this be the true interpretation, then the clause that follows must be, <span class="cmt_word">Nay</span> this <span class="cmt_word">I</span> cannot say, for on account of this very conflict - <span class="cmt_word">for this cause</span> - only to fight this great battle - <span class="cmt_word">I came</span> steadily forward <span class="cmt_word">to this hour</span>. I cannot pray to escape from it. If, however, we have the expression of an actual though momentary prayer, and if we give it the meaning, "bring me safely through and out of this hour," it corresponds with the Divine trust in the Father's love which, in the extremity of the anguish and desertion, he yet reveals, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> becomes equivalent to "Pray, this I need not say; the end is known" (Westcott). I know that I shall be delivered, <span class="accented">for this cause, viz</span>. <span class="accented">that</span> I should encounter and pass through the hour I came into the world, and have reached the final crisis. This is, to my mind, more satisfactory; the interrogative prayer gives a sentimental character to the utterance out of harmony with the theme. Godet thinks that the fact that, according to the synoptists, our Lord in the garden <span class="accented">did</span> actually offer the prayer which he <span class="accented">here</span> hesitates to present, is evidence of the historic character of both accounts. I differ from him, because the sublime answer to the prayer here given would seem to preclude the necessity of the final conflict. The circumstance that he <span class="accented">did</span> offer the prayer as interpreted above, a prayer which was veritably heard, is in harmony with the narrative of the agony.

"I am thine; thou art mine;" "Thy will be done;" "Not as I will, but as thou wilt;" "If this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done;" "Not my will, but thine be done." I bare my breast for the blow; I yield my <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> absolutely to thy control! God glorifies himself in many ways, and here we see the highest point to which the human can rise. Godet calls attention to the extraordinary mistake made by Colani, who founds a charge against the Gospel itself on the supposition that these solemn words were, "Father, glorify <span class="accented">my</span> Name." The synoptists tell us that at the baptism (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and at the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>) a literal voice of words was heard from heaven conveying intelligible ideas to John the Baptist and subsequently to Peter, James, and John. And here the same John (son of Zebedee) records, not only that such a kind of voice was repeated on this occasion, but reports the very words themselves. <span class="cmt_word">There came therefore a voice out of heaven</span>, <span class="accented">saying<span class="cmt_word"></span>, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again</span>. These words many of the crowd round about him, as well as Jesus himself, distinctly heard. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude that stood by said, It has thundered</span>; hearing only a voice of thunder. It will not, however, on that account be fair to this evangelist to say (with Paulus, Lucke, and even Hengstenberg) that there was no objective audible voice which any ear beside that of Jesus could hear, and which none but the mind of Jesus could interpret. It is not sufficient to say "that the thunder and the voice were identical." Hengstenberg quotes numerous passages from the Old Testament where thunder was interpreted to mean the "voice of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>), but there are numerous passages both in the Old Testament and in the Gospels and Acts where an objective voice was heard. Such voice was at times accompanied by thunder, but not in the majority of cases. In the promises made in the garden of Eden, in the call of Moses and Samuel, and in the communion that passed between the Lord and Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, Solomon, and Elijah, Jehovah spake in audible words without such auxiliary. When communications were made to Eli, to David, to Hezekiah, and others, they were given by the lips of prophetic men. When the Law was given to all the tribes of Israel, the thunder-trumpet was exceeding loud and long, and the people could not bear the awful experience, so that the Lord was pleased to speak to Moses only, and <span class="accented">he</span> was to communicate with the people. The case of Elijah is remarkable because the "still small voice" is distinguished from the thunder, etc., which had preceded it. Why should Hengstenberg have refrained from giving these Old Testament facts their <span class="accented">proper</span> weight? The rationalistic view would make the words spoken to have been the inference that either Jesus or John drew from a clap of thunder, and must conclude that the crowd, so far as the objective fact was concerned, were practically in the right. The narrative itself recounts a varied appreciation of a distinct and objective fact. Those who were not alive to any voice from heaven confounded it with thunder, lowered the Divine communication down to an ordinary natural fact. <span class="cmt_word">Others</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a few others," were much nearer to the reality when they <span class="cmt_word">said, An angel hath spoken to him</span> (compare reference to the angelic aid that came to the Lord in Gethsemane). The voice of God's plenipotentiary angel speaking in his Name, was recognized as a supernatural communication, though the meaning of it was not grasped (cf. the voice with which Jesus spoke to Paul on the way to Damascus). But we may reasonably suppose that these Greeks, that the disciples who surrounded Jesus, that the beloved John, found in the voice a direct answer to the previous sublime cry of the Lord. The prayer, "Father, glorify thy Name," received the answer, <span class="cmt_word">I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> In thy work and life hitherto, as Prophet, Master, Example, as my beloved Son, my Name has already been glorified in thee, and now in thy approaching sacrificial agony in which thou wilt become perfect as a Priest-King, and the Author of eternal salvation, "I will glorify it again."

This surely establishes, on the authority of Jesus, the objective character of the revelation. "It was necessary that you should hear and know and feel who and what I am." Ever thinking of others, living in them, he thinks of their spiritual advantage now. Thoma says that whereas the whole scene corresponds with the synoptic account of Gethsemane, it is idealized on the basis of the Johannine idea of the Divine Lamb and the Logos in flesh, and that Jesus here shows that he needed no strengthening, as the objective revelation was entirely for the sake of others, and not for his own consolation. This ingenious criticism of Thoma rests on the unjustifiable hypothesis that the scene before us did <span class="accented">not</span> precede the agony of the garden, but was a bare invention of the evangelist, because the latter ruled that Gethsemane needed "idealization." Why should not the two scenes be equally true, revealing the fundamental identity of character and personality, the one, moreover, preparing for the other? (See notes on John 19.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - 5. <span class="accented">The judgment of this world</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - Still more emphatically does Christ expound the heavenly voice, and vindicate for himself the most solemn position with reference to the world and its prince. The" world," or humanity evolving itself to the highest form of a complicated civilization, was present to him far more vividly than when the tempter showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. Instead of holding them in royal fee of the devil, and of compelling them to do his bidding, he declares that his hour, which had come, was an hour of judicial condemnation for the world. The corruption of the world, the radical injury done to human nature, starts out on its beautiful and decorated front like the leprosy did on the face of Naaman. <span class="cmt_word">Now is a judgment of the world</span>. Observe, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This is compatible with the statements of <a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17-19</a>, and not inconsistent with the frequent references in <a href="../../par/john/5.htm">John 5</a>. to the "last day." Because John gives prominence to the great principles of judgment, and implies that the books of remembrance and condemnation are written all over indelibly by the hand of the world itself, there is no proof that the Lord (in John) says nothing of the great catastrophic judgments of which the synoptic Gospels preserve the prophecy. Our Lord has rather revealed (according to John) the principles which make the judgment of the great day credible. What a man has become at any epoch of his existence, what a nation is about at any crisis of its history, whatsoever act represents the spirit of the whole world, is in each case the judgment which God, by his providence, passes upon him or it. Still more impressively with a second, <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">shall the prince of this world be cast out</span>. The phrase, "archon of this world," is a well-known later Hebraic phrase for "the ruler of the darkness of this world," the <span class="accented">shir-olam</span> of the rabbinical books, the angel of death, to whom was entrusted the rulership of the world outside of the sacred family. Christ declares that his own hour, in which the world and its prince would seem to be triumphant, would be the hour when he should be cast out of earth as he had been already cast out of heaven. This expulsion and destruction of the power and works of the devil was one great end assigned to the manifestation of the Son of God (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). It is important, however, to notice the difference of tenses. "Now is the judgment of this world," - this is the immediate result of his death; "Now <span class="accented">shall</span> the prince of this world be east out" describes the gradual victory of truth, which is pursued more explicitly in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a></div><div class="verse">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I, if I be lifted out of</span> (or, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the earth, will draw all</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">to myself. Now this he spake, signifying by what death he was about to die</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span> has been by Meyer, as well as many of the Fathers, referred to the Lord's resurrection and ascension. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> would certainly be in favor of it, and be a possible rendering if we hold (with Westcott and others) that resurrection and uplifting from the earth involve and presuppose a previous death, or that John always speaks of Christ's death as itself a glorious thing, as itself the commencement of the supreme glory of the Son of man. On the other hand - though this idea is reiterated by the opponents of the Fourth Gospel - there is nothing in the New Testament which makes the cross of Christ in itself a symbol of the exaltation of Jesus. Moreover, the next verse compels a closer reference to "the way in which he was about to die" - a mode of departure admirably expressed by the term "uplifting." The language of Jesus to Nicodemus, in which the same word occurs in describing the lifting up of the Son of man after the fashion in which the serpent was uplifted in the wilderness, confirms this interpretation of the evangelist, which we have no claim to traverse (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19</a>). Christ declared that the attraction of the cross would be mightier than all the fascination of the prince of this world. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "I will draw," is applied elsewhere (<a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>) to the Father's work of grace, which preveniently prepares men to come to Christ. In these words we learn that the attraction of the cross of Christ will prove to be the mightiest and most sovereign motive ever brought to bear on the human will, and, when wielded by the Holy Spirit as a revelation of the matchless love of God, will involve the most sweeping judicial sentence that can be pronounced upon the world and its prince. In <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a> the belief or the conviction that the prince of this world has been already condemned (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is one of the great results of the mission of the Comforter.

In ver. 23 the Lord had in their hearing spoken of himself as "Son of man." Meyer, by giving the dominant sense of glorification to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, thinks <span class="accented">that</span> the people must be contrasting, in pert criticism, the lowly "Son of man" before them with the "Son of man" of Daniel's vision. But it would be far more probable that the people accepted Christ's intimation of the manner of his death, and hence felt the incongruity of such a Son of man - One who dies, and therefore lives again - with the glowing pictures of Daniel or the 'Book of Henoch.' "The Christ abideth forever." <span class="cmt_word">And how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> They did not identify "the Son of man" with the Messiah.

It was once more a vague, dull inquiry, "Who art thou?" We are still in doubt who thou art, and how thou canst claim to be the Christ of our prophecies. To be our Christ, and die, is a contradiction in terms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.

The time for further instruction, or remonstrance, or declarations is at an end. The evangelist sums up, in vers. 44-50, the general substance of our Lord's teaching with reference to himself and his disciples and the world which would not believe; and thus, then, in a wonderful way, justifies, as it were, the non-answer to the captious question, "Who is this Son of man?" <span class="cmt_word">Yet a little while is the Light amongst you.</span> The "little while" of our Lord's day of ministry was often upon his lips (<a href="../../par/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16</a>). Verily to his consciousness it must have been but as the twinkling of an eye, and now it was a very little while even for his hearers. Based on this solemn fact, he makes a last public appeal to individuals, propounding gracious invitation, Divine promise, solemn warning; and so he terminated his public ministry, and vanished from before them. As far as the memory of his living words and deeds might influence them, the Light, though not among them, might still shine, and the glory of Pentecost would renew the appeal. <span class="cmt_word">Walk as ye have the Light</span>; make progress in the understanding of self, of duty, of time, of eternity, and act accordingly. The <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> is the reading preferred to the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the T.R. in this and the following verse by Tischendorf, Meyer, Westport and Hort, and the Revisers' text. Meyer here differs from Godet and others who, accepting the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>, give it, in virtue of certain passages in the classics, the sense of <span class="accented">quamdiu</span>, and justly maintains the sense "as," "in the measure that." According to the light that you see, <span class="cmt_word">walk, lest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, "in order that not") <span class="cmt_word">darkness overtake you: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth;</span> lest the possibility of seeing the Divine revelation in <span class="accented">me</span> be taken from you, and lest there be taken away from you that which you seem to have (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>). Then, in harmony with the great sayings of <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> and John 11:9, "In the night no man can work;" "In the night, when men cannot see the light of this world, they stumble over unseen perils and pitfalls;" so here, he says, in the darkness that will come upon men from making no use of the Light of the world, "they will not know whither they are going," they will find no work, have no perception of imminent danger, but, driven on and on by measureless force, they will drift over the fathomless unknown into infinite and endless suspense. When the Light of the world is spurned, and a godless evolution made to supply its place, humanity and the world have no goal set before them; there is no end at which they aim - no mind or will to guide the progress of mankind.

This utterance records the close of the Lord's public ministry, and therefore the solemn termination of the various scenes and discourses preserved in the synoptic narrative. The people of his love saw him no more till he appeared as a criminal in the hands' of the officers of the Sanhedrin, on his way to the Praetorium. In the silence of the home- at Bethany he probably spent the last day of his earthly ministry, which terminated in the marvelous converse at the Last Supper. "<span class="accented">This</span> time it was no mere cloud which obscured the sun, for to them the sun itself had <span class="accented">set</span>."

If "<span class="accented">so</span> many" <span class="accented">be</span> the correct reading, John is simply implying what he elsewhere expresses, that a widespread knowledge was possessed by him of groups of miraculous signs, of which he recorded only seven crucial symbolic specimens; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> wine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> bread; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> walking on the sea; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> healing nobleman's son; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> healing impotent man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> resurrection of Lazarus; to he followed by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> the healing of the ear of Malchns, and the resurrection of the Lord himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Signs in heaven, earth and sea;<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> startling miracles on human nature, and<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> on dead men, did not compel belief.

The tragic refrain still echoes on, "<span class="accented">He</span> came unto his own, and his own received him not? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a></div><div class="verse">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In order that the words of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report?</span> or the message which the prophets have delivered - the prediction they made of a suffering and rejected Christ, of One who would "sprinkle many nations," and in the very "travail of his soul see his seed." <span class="cmt_word">To whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?</span> It does not mean that no hearts responded to the appeal, that the voice from heaven fell on no susceptible ears; but that it is one of the anomalies of human life that man does seem so insensible to his own highest interests. Prophets are always wondering at the condition of mankind. Even Jesus marveled at the unbelief of his hearers. The <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Isaiah shows that prophets foresaw the issue of the kind of reception that a people who had been so faithless to Jehovah's lesser manifestations would give to the most amazing of all his self-disclosures. The <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> must not be explained away, the outline was presented by Isaiah of the reception which the favored but prejudiced and hardened house of Israel gave to Divine revelations. It would be filled in by the events which were then about to be enacted. God's intuition of actual facts, his unconditional foreknowledge of all contingent phenomena, do not necessitate their occurrence so as to deprive sinners of their guilt; yet when they have occurred, the causes which produced the widespread unbelief in the days of Isaiah were seen to be still at work, and to account for the strange incomprehensible mystery that blindness in part had happened to Israel. God works by law, and works freely by men and in them, not only foreseeing the evil and blindness, but positively punishing sin by blindness, taking away from a man that which he seemeth to have. By this means the "altar was built, the wood and the knife" for the great sacrifice. The use made of various portions of this oracle, by the Lord, by evangelists, by the apostles, by the deacon Philip, by Paul and Peter, shows that the early Church regarded it as the detailed description of the character suffering, and work of Christ. It became virtually a portion of the New Testament, and it was practically treated as such by Barnabas (100. 5, 'Ep. to Diog.,' 100. 49) and Justin Martyr (1 'Apol.,' 100. 50). The fifty-third of Isaiah may have been imperfectly understood by its author, may in his mind have had this, that, or the other original reference, and have suffered various Judaic interpretations. Modern criticism may scoff at it as a Messianic prophecy. All this does not touch the patent fact that nearly all the writers of the New Testament and numerous classes in the early Church used it as descriptive of their idea of Christ's work. It thus becomes of priceless value.

The issue of it was, "'they could not believe." <span class="cmt_word">Because Isaiah said again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. in another place</span>; illustrative of this great Messianic oracle and the reception it would meet with from the nation as a whole. In the passage which follows we have a translation which does not directly correspond with either the Hebrew or the LXX. of <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>. The prophet is bidden by the Lord to punish the people for their obduracy by blinding their eyes and hardening their heart, and even arresting the conversion and healing of the covenant people. This same solemn passage is quoted in four other places in the New Testament. Perhaps <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a> is hardly to be regarded as a citation; a small portion only of the passage is introduced from the prophet without reference to him, and this is inverted in order. In <a href="../../par/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14, 15</a> there is the nearer approach to the LXX., which, however, transforms the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e2;</span>, "to hear, hear ye," into <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "by hearing ye shall hear;" and similarly with the other clauses, - the imperative of God's command to the prophet being resolved into the future of most certain accomplishment, and in place of "Lest they understand with their heart, and convert, and he [God] heal them," LXX. reads, "Lest... should convert, and I [who give you the command to deliver such a message, notwithstanding its results upon them] heal them." This St. Matthew has followed. <a href="../../par/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a> has given a different representation again, and, while omitting a considerable portion of the passage, passes to the climax, which is put thus: "Lest they should be converted, and their sin should be forgiven them," showing that the evangelist, looking to the Hebrew rather than to the LXX., has resolved its meaning into a clearly related paraphrase. In <a href="../../par/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26, 27</a> the passage almost verbally follows the LXX. Here in the remarks of St. John the whole passage seems independent of the LXX., and to have resolved the Hebrew "imperative," addressed to the prophet, into an awful assurance of Divine agency in the matter. Instead of "shut their eyes," Hebrew imperative, or LXX. "their eyes they closed," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., he says, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">He hath blinded their eyes</span>; and so with the other terms: <span class="cmt_word">He hardened</span> <span class="cmt_word">their heart; in order that they should not</span> (lest they should) <span class="cmt_word">see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and should turn, and I should heal them.</span> In <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> the evangelist, returning to the first person, draws a distinction between the retributive activity of the pre-existent Christ of the earlier revelation and the historical Savior. There is no slip or negligence. Godet and Hengstenberg go a long way in making God the Author of the sin and rejection, and the cause of the impossibility of their repentance and healing. That which in all the several quotations of this passage we learn from Isaiah's oracle is that the unforced and willful rejection of the Divine Word is visited by condign withdrawment of the faculty to receive even more accessible and apprehensible truth. This is the great law of Divine operation in the nature of all moral beings. This law is described as a distinctly foreseen event, and by LXX. as an apprehensible and even conspicuous fact, and it is quoted by St. John as the direct consequence of the Divine activity. He does not mean to say that, because Isaiah foretold this as a Divine reprobation, they, whether they would or not as individuals, were fated to die the death of blindness, but they could not believe, because, on the principle involved in Isaiah's predictions, the Divine government had fulfilled itself, had acted upon its universal law, and in consequence of vows and acts of willful disobedience, they had thus fallen into the curse that belongs to a neglect of the Divine. "They could not believe." Thus even now disinclination to God and to righteousness leads to moral incapacity. Sin is punished by its natural consequences: unbelief is punished by unsusceptibility to clearest evidence; prejudice by blindness; rejection of Divine love by inability to see it at its best. How is this natural evolution brought about? Surely by laws of God. What are these laws but God's ways of acting with all moral agents whatever?

These words are used, not to mitigate the charge, but to show that, though individuals did believe, even among the rulers, they had not courage to avow their faith. The instances of Nicodemus and Joseph and others lie upon the surface. Godet thinks rather of Gamaliel and the like, "the Eras-muses of those days." Theirs was, indeed, an hypocrisy of unbelief, and it is not 'altogether banished from the modern world, and notwithstanding Christ's rejection by the nation as a nation, individuals saw his glory and believed. It is still true of municipalities, nations, even Churches, that they reject Christ, while individuals among them are molded by and obedient to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">But by reason of the Pharisees</span> - our Lord's most deadly enemies, from <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. to <a href="../../par/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. - <span class="cmt_word">they were making no confession</span> - or, <span class="accented">acknowledgment -</span> of his claims, <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be put out of the synagogue</span>; become the excommunicate, fall under the terrible ban (see <a href="../../par/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>).

Because the prophet saw the glory of Christ, the unutterable majesty of the "Word of God," he delivered, as we know, this tremendous burden. Few utterances of the New Testament convey in more startling form the conviction of the apostles touching the pre-existence of the Lord, and the identification of the Divine Personality of the Christ, with the highest conception that the Hebrew prophet entertained of the Almighty One, of the eternal Godhead.

Moulton suggests that the glory here thought of by the apostle was the "glory" of ver. 41 - the glory of the union of the Redeemer with his people, the glory of suffering and death. The reference to <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. appears to be the true solution. The glory of God himself in his awful holiness was of less interest than the glory of the Sanhedrin and the approval of the world. Alas! this glory is nearer, more obvious and has more to do with tangible, sensuous, advantages, than the Divine approval. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-50.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The <span class="accented">summation of the supreme conflict between our Lord and the world</span>. The portion of the chapter which follows is regarded by most commentators, Lucke, Meyer, Godet, Olshausen, and Westcott, as a summary of our Lord's teaching, as a reiteration by the evangelist of those salient points of the Lord's ministry which, while they are the life of the world, are nevertheless the grounds on which blinded eyes and hardened hearts rejected him. Vers. 44-46 characterize the believer; vers. 47, 48 emphasize Christ's relation to the unbeliever; vers. 49, 50 the principle upon which both deliverances turn and will continue to turn. There are those who think that these were special private addresses to the disciples, uttered after our Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) was hidden, but the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>) "cried aloud," would not then have been used, as it was used for the most public expressions of his doctrine, when given once for all (here comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28, 37</a>, with <a href="../../par/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>). Keim, De Wette, Baur, and Hilgenfeld think that, because there is no fresh departure here, it is proof that <span class="accented">all</span> the discourses of Christ in John are similarly put together with no historical basis. But if it be so, this differs strangely from all the rest of our Lord's discourses recorded by John in that it has no occasion, or persons, or opportunity to which it seems to fit. Certain aorists suggest the idea that John has here given specimens of our Lord's appeals which had ended in his being rejected by the nation as a whole. Luthardt takes the view of these words being spoken <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> on our Lord's departure, and with him Hengstenberg also agrees. These critics suppose that they form the closing words of our Lord's public ministry, delayed by the intercalary remarks of the evangelist, and really belong to the close of the thirty-sixth verse. Though the expressions flint follow are built upon the discourses elsewhere uttered, we admit, with Hengstenberg, that there is no verbal parallel that is at all close, and that therefore the evangelist must not be quoting from what he had already reported, but giving the substance of a threefold class of observations found from one end of the Gospel to the other, and in words that he had heard the Master use. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44, 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,PGBR> <span class="cmt_word">but on him that sent me; and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me</span>. These words do not occur before, but in every form our Lord had exalted "him that sent him." His doctrine or teaching, his purpose in manifestation, the secret food that sustained him, the Divine presence that never left him alone, the entire background of the mission of his human will and life into the world, the object of faith to men as revealed in his humanity, and that which the spiritual eye ought to see, nay - if the beholder did but know it does see, constitute an unveiling of the eternal Father who sent him into the world (see <a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 9, 24</a>). It becomes, then, of high value to grasp the truth. We actually believe in God when believing in him. His mission is lost in the glory of God who appears in him. So far as he is <span class="accented">sent</span>, he was necessarily of lower order and rank than he who sent him. His humanity began to be in time; it was generated in the womb of the Virgin; it was sanctified and sent into the world; and yet through it there was the highest revelation of the Father. We cannot attribute so stupendous a thought to the evangelist, and at the same time we admit the portentous singularity and uniqueness of the consciousness which could thus aver identity of nature with God and the completeness of revelation that the Speaker was making in himself of the Father.

The evangelist had said, in his prologue, "In him was life," and the Life (the eternal Logos of life) was "the Light of men." All true understanding, all purifying, gracious influence shed on human affairs, nature, or destiny, are the issue and result of the Divine Life which, under every dispensation, has wrought in humanity. Above all, "the Light that lighteth every man," namely, that which has always and which ever will radiate from the life conferred on our humanity by the Logos, the life of God in mind and conscience, "came into the world"  - came, that is, in a new and more effective form, came in the radiance of a perfect human life. The evangelist has sustained his teaching by quoting the solemn words of Jesus in <a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; also <a href="../../par/john/9-5.htm">John 9:5</a>, where a special narrative of miraculous love typified both the need in which the human family, the sacred Israel, and even his own disciples, stood of light, and of the light which he could pour upon the sightless eyeballs. And now the connection of this passage is - You could not behold me if light did not stream forth from me. <span class="cmt_word">I have come</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">am come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, this has been and is my abiding purpose; cf. <a href="../../par/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>) <span class="cmt_word">a Light into the world, and</span> my object has been and is that <span class="cmt_word">whosoever believeth on me</span> - whoso-ever sees by the inward eye that which I really am, sees how my life stands related to the Father, whosoever assents to the new revelation thus given, even over and above the "<span class="accented">inward</span> light" of the Logos - <span class="cmt_word">should not abide in the darkness</span> which enwraps all souls; for, as said in the prologue, "<span class="accented">the</span> Light" (the archetypal Light) shineth upon the darkness of human nature, and the darkness comprehendeth it not." It should be especially noticed that in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> St. Paul had grasped and uttered the fullness of this thought.

The "hearing" is clearly not identical with spiritual acceptance, but is restricted to the awful charge of responsibility that comes upon every man who simply hears, knows what Christ's words are, and then "<span class="accented">keeps"</span> them not so as to fulfill their intention. Christ says, I judge him not. I am not <span class="accented">now</span> pronouncing a sentence upon him; I am his Savior; but this is his condemnation, that he believes not, etc. (<a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17-19</a>). Our Lord claimed, in the sermon on the mount, to be the Executor of a judgment, and in <a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-29</a> he declared that he would be as Son of man, the final Adjudicator of doom on the disobedient (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>.), and in many places he made this thought even more solemn by speaking of himself on that occasion, not as the compassionate Savior, but the Administrator of an inviolable law, which cannot be swayed by immediate emotion, but will effectuate itself on eternal and unswerving principles.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a></div><div class="verse">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 49, 50.</span> - There is much emphasis to be laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which implies that our Lord would give a sacred reason for the tremendous power with which his <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would be invested.

He stood and spake always as the Voice of the Eternal One, from whom he came, with saving powers. <span class="cmt_word">He has given me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak</span>.

My words and their manner and opportunity and tone are all of them the outcome of the Father's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span>. It certainly is incredible that John could have put these words into the lips of Jesus. They are no mere summary. They are set down with awful sincerity as having burned themselves into his memory. But the Lord added, "I may be rejected and my words spurned, and yet they may go on as apparitors of judgment, but however that may be, and <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that his commandment,</span> his commission to me<span class="cmt_word">, is life eternal</span> - is so now" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12, 13</a>). "The Law is ordained unto life," said Paul, and "the goodness of God leadeth us unto repentance." The depth of this sublime experience goes down and back into the eternal counsels. <span class="cmt_word">The things which therefore I speak</span> (am speaking even at this moment), <span class="cmt_word">even as the Father has said unto me, so I speak</span>. "In rejecting me and my words, men reject and insult the Father. His word they dare to renounce, as solemn and unalterable as the word spoken on Sinai. They not only reject me, but they count themselves unworthy of eternal life. They not only spurn Law, but love." Thus, at the conclusion of the public ministry, the evangelist sets forth, in a few burning words, the theme of the prologue, so far as it is realized in the offer of a full revelation of the Logos to the world in human flesh. This Logos found adequate utterance through the human life and lips of Jesus. "The Father has been so amply revealed that the non-believer and rejecter, who hears and does not keep my sayings, is disbelieving and rejecting Hill." These potent words, and this wonderful conclusion of the entire record of the public ministry of Jesus, is the appropriate summary of teachings which were now brought to a dose. Without any exact parallels, they breathe the spirit of the whole teaching, they supply the basis of the prologue. It is, however, dear that the style is different from the prologue, and from the reflection of the evangelist in previous verses. Just as the whole Gospel is a series of recollections which form from their own intrinsic glory and truth a sacred inimitable whole, so this <span class="accented">spicilegium</span> is a brief <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio - a</span> gathering up of the whole in the narrow compass of a few precious lines. Though "the hour" has come, it waits. The comparison between this method of the evangelist and that of the apocalyptist is very impressive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

This supplies a chronological note, which is not exhausted by the mysterious and pathetic act which is described, but embraces the entire communion of soul with his disciples, and with the Father in their presence, detailed in <a href="../../par/john/13.htm">John 13-17</a>. Commentators have differed greatly as to the reference of this phrase - whether to the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, as Kling and Luthardt, or to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as Wieseler and Tholuck; both these interpretations limit the meaning of the passage. Christ's knowledge that his hour was come was not kept from him till that moment, nor was his love to his own disciples limited or qualified by the advent of the Passover. It is far better, with Westcott, Coder, Meyer, and Lange, to take the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, with the principal verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This becomes mere obvious if <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> be taken, as it generally is taken, in Greek, to mean "unto the uttermost," "absolutely" "perfectly." Godet and Lucke add to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> here the <span class="accented">manifestation</span>, or <span class="accented">proof</span>, of the intensity and tenderness of the Divine love. Meyer doubts this signification of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>. The whole of the intervening sentence is in apposition with the subject of the sentence. The evangelist was eye-withes of the manner and look of his Lord, and ventured to say what was passing in his mind. He was justified by what followed, and threw back into the spirit of this strange and solemn action the account which the Lord afterwards gave of himself. Throughout the whole passage we detect; the extraordinary blending of Divine and human of which John was the witness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus knowing</span> (as he did know) <span class="cmt_word">that the hour was</span> <span class="cmt_word">come</span> - an hour for which he had been long waiting, and to which frequent reference has been made. The crisis has arrived, the breach with the authorities was final, the disciples themselves were trembling in doubt, the great law had been uttered, the glorification of the Son of man must now be accomplished by departure rather than by longer ministry, by death rather than by universal acclaim - <span class="cmt_word">that</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> here notes the Divine purpose, or what is not infrequently introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "the contemplated result" (see Canon Evans on  "the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament," <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 3, 2nd series) - <span class="cmt_word">he</span>, Jesus, the Son of man, <span class="cmt_word">should depart out of this world</span> (this is one theme of the following discourse, one of its key-notes, <a href="../../par/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>, and many other passages) unto the Father. If so, death was not an ending of life, but a departure to the Father - a coming into closer and more intimate relations and communion with the Father than was possible, even for him, in this sinful and evil world. Frequently the demonstrative pronoun is used to designate this transitory, perilous, sad state of being. Further, Jesus <span class="cmt_word">having loved his own</span>, his very own, whom the Father had given him, <span class="cmt_word">who were</span> and would continue <span class="cmt_word">in the world</span>, and have tribulation there (see <a href="../../par/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-1.htm">John 16:1-4, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11, 14, 18</a>), and all the more so because of his departure and the cessation of his earthly manifestation and ministry. Here the sentence ends with the climacteric expression, <span class="cmt_word">He loved them utterly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he manifested, and that before the Paschal Lamb should be slain for them, his absolute, extreme, unutterable love. Archdeacon Watkins has made an interesting suggestion, that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> represents, in Greek, the Hebrew idiom of the repetition of the action of the verb; whereas the LXX. often presents this Hebraism in literal Greek, as <a href="../../par/genesis/20-17.htm">Genesis 20:17</a>, yet in <a href="../../par/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a> a similar reduplication is Grecized by the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and that what St. John, a Hebrew writing in Greek, meant by the use of it was simply," He loved them with a fullness of love." This usage is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, by later Greek and by classical usage. It probably means in <a href="../../par/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a> "at last," but not necessarily so even there. Margin of Revised Version gives "to the uttermost." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, to betray him;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A supper having commenced</span>; or, <span class="accented">being then in progress</span> - without doubt the meal in which our Lord terminated the Old Testament dispensation and introduced the New, and which John discriminates, therefore, from the Passover proper referred to in ver. 1. The evangelist now reverts to the diabolic design which had been injected into the heart of Judas. <span class="cmt_word">The devil having already cast into the heart</span> (of Judas) <span class="cmt_word">that he</span> - Meyer's suggestion that the devil put this design into his own heart, does not lighten the construction, and encumbers the passage with ideas which are foreign to the Bible - (<span class="cmt_word">even</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Judas</span>, (<span class="cmt_word">the son</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of Simon, the Iscariot, should betray him</span>. The idea came from the devil, but the purpose of the devil was not irrevocable. The evangelist looked through his tears of love to the traitor's face as he sat at meat, and felt how the very excess and uttermost and hyperbole of love was reached and scaled by the contact between the treachery of the one and the Divine humiliation of the other. The contrast between these two mental states is one of the most striking antitheses in the Gospel. But how should John know that Judas had already plotted the betrayal of his Master? Hengstenberg makes the wise suggestion that the fourth evangelist was acquainted with the synoptic tradition of the priority of Judas's bargain with the chief priests (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-10.htm">Mark 14:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3-6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span> - a significant hint of the complex wonder of the Lord's Person. John felt at this moment that the consciousness of Jesus was receding into the eternal self-consciousness of the Logos when he thus ventures to speak - <span class="cmt_word">that the Father</span> - in the great act of his generation - <span class="cmt_word">gave</span> <span class="cmt_word">all things into his hands, and that he came forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from God, and was going back</span> (<span class="accented">or, away</span>) to God, in the glory of his incarnation and the mystery of his death and resurrection. The whole of the incarnate ministry of Jesus was a separation, to some extent, from God, just as the close of it, in the death and resurrection, was a return to the glory which he had with the Father before all worlds. We must admit the extraordinary quality of the evangelist's assertion. He here throws back into the majestic manner of the Christ the hints which the subsequent discourse of our Lord must have given him of the Divine greatness which flashed at times from his sacred Person, and conferred a boundless significance on the subsequent act of humiliation. Christ gave the highest proof of his Divine self-consciousness in this display of his condescending love, this voluntary abasement to the lowest place in the household of faith. The use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> twice ever (vers. 1 and 3) is contrasted with the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> of ver. 7. The vast confessions here made are declared to be matters of absolute intuitive knowledge, not the results of long experience. Christ did not "come to know;" he "knew" all these facts about himself. It must not be supposed that this was a theological idea which came into the writer's mind afterwards. St. Paul, in the Epistle to the Philippians (Philippians 2:6-8), had adequately grasped the same thought long before St. John penned this Gospel (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5</span>  - Commentators differ as to the motive which induced our Lord to perform this menial act, to adopt the gesture, girding, and duties of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, to divest himself of his <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> or upper garments, and to appear and veritably to act as a slave. Strauss regards it as a mythical representation of one of our Lord's discourses on humility. Lange, with much pertinence, believes it to correspond to the pain, which he manifested, at the very last Supper, with the unseemly contest for pre-eminence among the apostles (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>, "Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? I am among you as he that serveth"). Others, like Meyer, see no such reference, and require the presence of no such motive. It is remarkable that at such a season this dispute could have arisen at all. I-laving undoubtedly broken out on more than one occasion, our Lord chose the midst of this feast, when we learn from other sources there was such an outbreak, for this emphatic revelation of the royalty of service. Wunsche ('Erl.,' p. 550) says that both "before" and "alter" the Passover festival it was customary, in order to demonstrate the equality and liberty of the guests, to practice mutual interchanges of the ordinary menial service of <span class="accented">hand-washing</span> ('Pesachin,' fol. 108). In this verse every sentence is a distinct picture. <span class="cmt_word">He riseth from the supper, and layeth down his upper garments, and when he had taken a towel, he girded himself</span> (Edersheim and Wunsche both give proof that the Talmud repeatedly Grecizes the word here rendered "towel," <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "linen cloth," by the word <span class="accented">lentith</span> or <span class="accented">alen-tith</span>) after the fashion of the humblest slave; then <span class="cmt_word">he poureth water into the washing-basin</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the article of furniture in the room ("Nihil ministerii omittit," says Grotius. Thus he discharges every part of the duty, while the disciples wonder at the new revelation). <span class="cmt_word">And he began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</span> Westcott refers to the rabbinic commentators on <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>, "<span class="accented">Among</span> men, the slave washes his master, but with God it is not <span class="accented">so</span>." So then the inversion of all human social relations forced on John's mind the deep truth that we are here face to face with the Divine - with the Divine-human. John here strains his words to give some conception of what passed in his own mind when he saw our Lord's face, and witnessed this great revelation of his character. Though this evangelist did not record the "<span class="accented">Transfiguration</span>," there were moments in Christ's history which produced a still pro-founder impression upon him, and in which he veritably saw the glory of the Only Begotten of God in his Master's form. On this occasion the highest conception of his Divine Personality, origin, and destiny, was blended with the deepest descent of the Lord's entire humanity to the level of weakness, pollution, and sin. The greatest manifestation of God was in the revelation of the exceeding limits, the infinite depth, which love could compass. We may see a little farther on what were the special <span class="accented">steps</span> our Lord took to give this sense of love "<span class="accented">to</span> the uttermost" on the part of him to whom all the universe had been entrusted, who had come from, and was going back to, the Father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel wherewith he was girded.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-6.htm">John 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It cannot be determined with whom our Lord commenced the feet-washing. Some of the older expositors have said it was with Judas. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> might denote that several of the disciples, in awestruck wonder, had submitted without a word, and then (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> resumptive) <span class="cmt_word">he cometh to Simon Peter.</span> But the great bulk of ancient and modern expositors suppose that Peter was the first to whom this great grace was offered. At all events, in his impulsive manner always rushing forwards, and ready to give his Master advice, and to be the mouthpiece of otherwise unuttered feelings, Peter was the first to exclaim, (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">saith unto</span> <span class="accented">him</span>, and with strong emphasis on the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou wash my feet</span>? The protest was natural. It corresponds with many another scene in Peter's life; as when he said, "<span class="accented">Depart</span> from me; for I am a sinful man," or cried, "That be far from thee," and later on in this chapter, "Why cannot I follow thee now?" or, "I have never eaten anything common or  unclean." This trait in Peter's character is wonderfully accurate, and corresponds with the portraiture of the same man in the synoptic narrative (see Introduction, p. 115.). There is here an analogous blending of reverence and self-will, of outwardness and forwardness - a new illustration of one who would distinguish himself by the greatness of his humility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-7.htm">John 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, That which I am doing thou knowest not now</span> - thou hast not absolute knowledge of, thou hast not seen through as yet; <span class="cmt_word">but after these things</span>, afterwards when I shall have completed my present undertaking, thou (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shalt</span> come by clear proof and full discovery and intimate acquaintance to <span class="cmt_word">understand</span>. This is sometimes referred to the subsequent illumination of the Holy Spirit, or even to the higher life of the future world (Luthardt), but the above interpretation is more consonant with the context. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> may (as Westcott suggests) point to the whole manifestation of love as it should complete itself on the cross, and become illumined by the Resurrection and by the gift of the Spirit, when the same mind should be put into Peter that was in Christ Jesus; consequently we may reasonably apply this great word to many of our earthly experiences. God's ways, Christ's government of his Church, and the mystery of our lot, are often so puzzling that we cannot be said to know them objectively or absolutely. We know (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) but in part, and see (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by means of a mirror (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>); but eventually in the fulness of the Divine manifestation we shall know (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>) completely, subjectively, in the depths of our personal consciousness. <span class="cmt_word">Peter saith to him</span>, with mere emphasis than before, with an intensity of double negative and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not ever wash my feet</span> - "not while eternity lasts." "A praiseworthy modesty," says Calvin, "were it not that with God obedience is better than worship." This vehement, Peter-like burst showed that even yet he had not learned his profound dependence upon his Lord. Exuberant utterance of a love which in its superlative enthusiasm was in danger of severing the relation between his Lord and himself, elicited from Christ a reply which went far Beneath this purely symbolic washing, and gave even to it a moral significance which it had not possessed before. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, If I wash thee</span> (not thy feet) <span class="cmt_word">not, thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">no part with me</span> - no <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, no portion, no share, no communion, no common inheritance with me in the honors and blessings of the kingdom. This may be understood in two ways: either, "If I do not by my grace cleanse you from your defilement, wash you in a deeper sense, in a more abundant and effectual manner than by giving you this practical lesson, there is utter misunderstanding of my relation to you - you have no part nor share with me." And this ver. 11 seems to favor. Hengstenberg strongly defends this view as a reference by Christ to his power on earth to forgive sins, and confer the pure and new nature (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4, 9-11</a>); and this doubtless lies in the solemn tone of the Lord. A refusal to accept the Divine cleansing is the only ground of exclusion from the benefits of the bloodshedding. Still another more obvious meaning arises, "<span class="accented">If</span> you refuse this manifestation of humble love from me, if you put your own pride between yourself and me, if you disdain this act of self-surrender, claiming to understand me and our mutual relations better than I, you have no part with me. This is a symbol of my love to you, and of what is to be your love to one another (ver. 15); if you refuse to accept it from me, you will then have no part with me in the manifestation of the spirit of self-sacrificing love which I have come to inaugurate." Peter must learn the beauty and glory of service for the sake of others; and if he were unable to understand and accept this act of love, he must separate himself from all share in the Master's work. This truth dawned upon him, but only in part, and it led to the extraordinary revulsion of feeling which followed.

Once more he will go before and give advice to his Master. The very same Peter who drew the sword in Gethsemane and then fled, who went to the high priest's palace and then denied his Lord; the very same Peter who rushed into the water anal then cried, "Lord, save me, I perish," who cried, even on the Mount of Transfiguration, "Let us build three tabernacles;" and when our Lord spoke of his cross said, "This shall not be done unto thee;" - the same Simon Peter now <span class="cmt_word">said to him</span>, "If it comes to the primal experience of being washed by thee in thine unutterable love, if there be any question of part and share with thee in thy work, I will (cf. ver. 37) go with thee to prison and to death, then, blessed <span class="cmt_word">Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all my uncovered body; seeing that my power of thinking and all my capacity for service alike need cleansing." Peter not unreasonably felt the weakness and corruption of his nature, and cried out, as we all are often disposed to do, for renewal and sanctification of every faculty and energy of his being. In this he showed a lack of realization of the new world into which grace had brought him, and once more needed correction. Chrysostom says, "In his deprecation be was vehement, in his yielding more vehement, but both came from his love." But even here we see the same eagerness to go beyond the Lord, and dictate the course to be pursued. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him</span>. Christ's answer here undoubtedly shows that he is speaking of something far more important than the foot-washing. He goes back to the spiritual meaning which Peter attributed to his words. <span class="cmt_word">He that has been bathed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is indeed washed from head to foot, <span class="cmt_word">hath no further need than to wash his feet</span>, <span class="cmt_word">but is altogether clean.</span> By personal communion with the Lord and belief in him, by the word which he had spoken to his disciples, they were (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) clean (<a href="../../par/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>). They had been washed from the defilement of their old nature, they had undergone a thorough moral and spiritual change, by moral union with Christ. They were reconciled and cleansed; they therefore did not need a fundamental change to be wrought daily in head, hands, and life. Just as a man who had thoroughly bathed only requires the removal of the soil contracted in the daily walk; so a regenerated and forgiven man is clean, and, like Peter, should not need, being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, more than the foot-cleansing which Christ in Divine condescension had then granted. It was inevitable that some of the Fathers (Augustine, Theodore) and many modern expositors (Hengstenberg, Godet, and Wordsworth) should see here a reference to baptism, and speak of Peter's having overlooked the grace of his baptism. When it is remembered, however, that nothing but John's "baptism unto repentance" had been administered to the disciples, and that this cleansing is, in <a href="../../par/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>, distinctly referred to the <span class="accented">word</span> of Christ, it is a very unnecessary trifling with the text to find in this <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> baptism or any sacramental or symbolic act. Lampe and Cocceius, in rendering <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, substitute for baptism, the regeneration of the Spirit, and treat the washing of the feet as equivalent to the daily forgiveness of sins of infirmity. Archdeacon Farrar, 'Early Days of Christianity,' vol. 1. p. 126, suggests that this intensely interesting scene may account for Simon Peter's picturesque expression (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), wherein he enjoins on Christians to "tie on humility like a dress fastened with knots;" and also for the apostle's "insight into the true meaning of baptism, as being, not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God." <span class="cmt_word">And ye are clean</span>; and therefore these words and this principle apply to you. Dr. Westcott finds in this phrase a reference to the purity of the <span class="accented">visible</span> Church, notwithstanding, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the presence of Judas in the group; but the exception itself which follows shows that the Lord did not regard Judas as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The suggestion of the passage is precisely contrary to that so often drawn. <span class="cmt_word">But not all</span>. This reference to Judas may have been one more warning to the man who was plotting against his Master's life.

John certainly calls attention to the Lord's knowledge of the secret of Judas, and justifies thus his Divine prerogative. That Strauss, Hilgenfeld, and others should see here an innuendo against Peter, and the charge against Peter of advocating a kind of Ebionitie daily ablution of the whole body, is willful and uncalled for.

There was no affectation of humility about it. The purpose of the Lord was distinctly practical and ethical.

Moulton calls attention to the trial arrangement. <span class="accented">Three</span> particulars precede the great utterance that follows (cf. vers. 1-3; cf. also <a href="../../par/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>, etc.; John 17:22, 23), as well as the three topics of the intercessory prayer; also the three words from the cross (<a href="../../par/john/19-27.htm">John 19:27-30</a>) and three appearances to the disciples (<a href="../../par/john/21-14.htm">John 21:14</a>).

At this supreme moment he does not repudiate this high function, nor abate any of his lofty claims. He was most obviously the highest in his condescending love. He had given no more amazing proof of the originality and supremacy of his nature than this inversion of all ordinary relations. So I AM - more, indeed, than "the Teacher," "the Savior," more than "the Master," as Peter said on a memorable occasion, "God was with him," and he was Immanuel - "God with us," and "Lord of all" (<a href="../../par/acts/10-37.htm">Acts 10:37, 38</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14</a></div><div class="verse">If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet; ye ought also to wash one another's feet: for I have given</span> <span class="cmt_word">you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, "as," "like as," was used by our Lord rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>, "that which." The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> shows that he had set before his disciples a parallel, an example, a symbolic type of the service they were to render to one another, and was not establishing a custom or exact ordinance. The washing of the feet was an Oriental custom of great antiquity as a mark of hospitality (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; Abigail, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>; see also <a href="../../par/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38, 44</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a> there is trace of such a custom of Christian hospitality. Considering the ease with which the Church has established a ceremonial from an isolated text, it is remarkable that no more literal use has been made of this injunction. However, <span class="accented">Maundy Thursday</span>, a name derived from <span class="accented">Dies mandati</span>, was celebrated as the day on which this great command, or that contained in ver. 34, was <span class="accented">given - Mandatum novum do vobis - and</span> the feet of the newly baptized were washed. The endeavor to make Augustine the authority for this religious practice is doubtful; but the Council of Toledo (A.D. 694) mentions this particular day as that on which it was appropriate. In the early Gallican Church there was such a ritual, and the forms of <span class="accented">pedilavium</span> observed are to be read in early Gothic and Galliean missals. Bernard of Clairvaux tried to convert the ceremony into a sacrament, but without success. And it would seem that some effort was made to introduce it into Spain. "In 1530, Wolsey washed, wiped, and kissed the feet of fifty-nine poor men at Peterborough. The practice was continued by English sovereigns till the reign of James II." (Westcott). No traces of it are to be found in the Ambrosian ritual, but the preservation of the custom is found now in the Russian imperial palace, in the ceremonies of the holy week at Rome, and in the palaces of Vienna, Madrid,Munich. The practice was for a time retained by the United Brethren and Mennonites, and the Tunkers of Philadelphia (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' vol. 1. arts. "Baptism," &sect;&sect; 34, 67, and "Maundy Thursday;" Herzog., 'Encyc.,' art. "Fusswaschung," by H. Merz; and Schaff's 'Herzog.,' art. "Tunkers"). The Church has for the most part looked below the mere form to the real substance of the Lord's teaching, and only thus can we appreciate it adequately. The very injunction would be an inadequate, burdensome one where the feet are covered, and would become impossible and valueless in the Northern and Western world. The service demanded is the self-forgetting ministry of love, which places the interests of self behind and below those of others. Nothing is more theoretically easy and acceptable than this principle, but nothing more difficult of accomplishment. This sentence of our Lord is a noble illustration of the method in which a great principle is made by him the basis of a small duly (cf. Paul's vindication of his own truthfulness and freedom from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17-20</a>; he based it on God's own faithfulness to promise).

This is one of the essential marks, and ever will be, of the mind that was in Christ Jesus (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23, 24</a>, where an analogous phrase justifies the disciples in expecting and fleeing from persecution - a step in which they would simply be following their Lord's example; cf. a very different use of the proverb in <a href="../../par/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>, where it is used to warn a blind man from assuming the office of a guide, and the resemblance of the character, etc., between the Teacher and disciple).

The sublime principle by itself may be something, but if it be never put into practice, the last great beatitude is forfeited.

This paragraph draws the circle of his cleansed ones, of those who accept him as Master and Lord in the fullest sense, more closely (at) out him. But the proceeding is tragic in the extreme; one of the twelve chosen as apostles is a traitor in disguise. The foot-washing has been an awful insufficiency in his case.

It refers to Christ's choice of apostles, not to the eternal election to salvation. This interpretation corresponds more closely with the text, though it savors of a fatalism foreign to the Scripture. There is, however, a true sense in which the evil-disposed man is so placed that, if he will sin, he must sin along certain well-defined lines. The forty-first psalm, from which the quotation is made, is not strictly Messianic; it is descriptive of the ideal Sufferer, the holy but outraged man, whose melancholy condition is sure to be characterized by treachery among his familiar friends. Christ implies that, if he were to fulfill this portraiture, then this bitter dreg would be put into his cup; and so he humanly made this choice, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps which in their tenderness of love might have saved Judas from the worst, but which were really part of a Divine plan which would vindicate his own foresight and the method of Divine government. A full understanding of the formula in Matthew and John, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc0;&#x1fbe;</span>, will save us from putting into these words a hopeless fatalism. Notice that the LXX. reads this passage differently, and is not so closely allied to the Hebrew: "He that eateth my leaves hath magnified against me his surreptitious despite, his tricky antagonism." Great beauty is given to the passage by the R.T. <span class="accented">you</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, for it suggests the idea that Christ was the real Host of the twelve, the Father and Provider of his family. Christ must be regarded as the Father and Host of the entire group of guests, and the treacherous treatment of a host throughout the East is regarded as a sign of peculiar obduracy.

He may have intended: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> To comfort those who are bewildered by the thought of the treachery within their enclosure, and to assure them that such conduct on the part of an apostle must not be allowed to lower their estimate of apostolic duty. Certain ecclesiastical interpreters find here that the unworthiness even of Judas did not destroy the Divine character of his testimony, and that the immoral character of the minister now does not annul the commission he has received. This dogma is essentially hostile to the teaching of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The royal power of the dying Christ; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the bold identification of his own claims with those of his Father. Few more wonderful sayings were uttered by Jesus, if we ponder the connection in which they stand; but let it be observed that we do <span class="accented">not</span> owe to the Fourth Gospel the <span class="accented">matter</span> of this saying. It must have been familiar to the readers of John from the solemn records of the Gospel of Matthew. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-30</span> correspond with the scene which Matthew describes (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-21.htm">Matthew 26:21</a>, etc.) as occurring during the Paschal meal, and preceding the departure of Judas before the Supper was instituted - "as they did eat." The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in <a href="../../par/mark/14-18.htm">Mark 14:18</a> corresponds and finds its explanation in the scene described by John, as also his quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. It does not follow, because the synoptics omit the "feet-washing," that they were ignorant of it; John's purpose was to record that which they had omitted. On the other hand, John does give some very significant indications of the same general current of inner life in the mind of Jesus and of the twelve. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>) shows that at this very moment Judas had so far given way to his avarice, impatience, disappointment, and innate pride and selfishness, as to be simply seeking his opportunity to betray his Master in the absence of the multitude. He had his price; he was meditating treachery. Granting the mixture of motive which may have agitated him, we condemn the pleading of numerous modern writers, who almost extenuate his malice and represent him as victim of the violent vulgar passion of the multitude for a triumphant secular Messiah. Every touch or stroke in the evangelic narrative shows how utterly Impervious to goodness the traitor really was; and John gives us a further hint, in addition to that supplied by the synoptists, as to the very commencement of the agony, the details of which they prolong into the night. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was troubled in the spirit</span> (cf. notes on John 11:33). This is one of the strongest expressions used of the sorrows of Christ; the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span> even was deeper down in his nature than what is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of Matthew. The distress penetrated from "body" to "soul," and then to inmost "spirit." The Lord was terribly perturbed, not merely with approaching agony aggravated by treachery and desertion, but by the contrast between his love and the issue, between an apostle and his doom. <span class="cmt_word">And he testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you</span>. A close specification of coming events takes the place of the more vague utterances of vers. 17-19. <span class="cmt_word">One of</span> <span class="cmt_word">you shall betray me</span>. The synoptic account introduces the vivid scene of humble and heart-.rending inquiry, "Lord, is it I?" to which the reply was made, "The one that dippeth his hand in the dish with me shall betray me," followed by a still more awful warning, and imprecation calling the self-consciously guilty man to hesitate, to pause for his own sake (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a>). And, further, we learn that Judas received the answer, unheard by his fellow-disciples that it was he who was in this imminent danger. This scene, however, was so impressive to the majority that the synoptic tradition failed to record a briefer side-scene, of which John was the principal witness, and which he here describes. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples</span> (<span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>) <span class="cmt_word">were gazing on one another, being in perplexity concerning whom he spake</span>. They were looking on in mute or whispering amazement and tribulation upon one another, being in sore bewilderment (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but as yet they did not suspect Judas. <span class="cmt_word">There was lying</span>, says our text, reclining at the table, <span class="cmt_word">in the bosom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "against the breast" - <span class="cmt_word">one of his disciples whom Jesus loved.</span> Observe, this sacred designation occurs in <a href="../../par/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20</a>. In <a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a> it is "the other disciple whom Jesus <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">amabat</span>, implying that the love of Jesus was not confined to John, but embraced Peter also; whereas <span class="accented">here</span> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, the higher love of respect and affection, <span class="accented">diligebat</span>. We can have no doubt, from the enumeration of the group in <a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, etc., that it is one of Zebedee's sons. Now one of these, James, as we learn from the narrative of <a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, soon passed away. The author of the Fourth Gospel does undoubtedly mean to refer to John, and to represent the disciple <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> as no other than himself. The <span class="accented">attitude</span> so carefully described had been adopted by the Jews at table. It shows that John was seated, or was reclining, next to Jesus on his right, and therefore could, more easily than his next companion on the left, have sought and received an answer from the Lord. Whether this was Peter or Judas does not appear certain. Edersheim has represented Peter's place as on the opposite side of the horseshoe table. Words from that distance could have been overheard by all. At the celebration of the Passover, the guests were accustomed originally to <span class="accented">stand</span>; but after the Captivity the custom fell into desuetude.

Westcott imagines that Peter was on the <span class="accented">left</span> side, in the place of real honor (?), though not in such proximity as, unobserved, to ask the question. Edersheim also speaks of the <span class="accented">left</span> side as the place of honor, but assigns no adequate reason for such a violation of universal usage and metaphor. The natural impetuosity of Peter would have induced him, if he had been so near, to have asked the question himself. It is more probable that Judas himself was there, judging from the language of <a href="../../par/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>, and from the act which follows. Either with T.R., <span class="cmt_word">He spake to him, to ask who it might be</span>; <span class="cmt_word">or, saith, Tell</span> (<span class="cmt_word">us</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who it is concerning whom he speaks</span>; as though Peter had rushed to the conclusion that John knew.

The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the morsel of meat or bread dipped into the charoseth, a mead of wine and fruit used at the Paschal meal. The usage is illustrated by the LXX. version of <a href="../../par/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a> and <a href="../../par/job/31-17.htm">Job 31:17</a>. In the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> is used for distribution of food, <a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. The act of Jesus was almost contemporaneous with the "Thou sayest it" of the synoptists It was twofold in meaning, explaining to John what he wished to know fur Peter's sake, and giving Judas one more gracious chance to repent and believe in the Divinity of love rather than that of display, power, and pomp. Judas had been dipping his hand into the same dish with his Master, eating his bread. Instead of resenting such effrontery the blessed Lord gave him in pity the last opportunity to escape, he puts the morsel sopped in the acid wine, the bread of fellowship, into his very lips, and the miscreant received it. The name of Judas, and of his father, and of the place cursed by being his birthplace, are once more introduced at length (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a></div><div class="verse">And after the sop Satan entered into him.

How could this be known? The evangelist clearly saw what he thus described - he saw the malign and unrelenting expression on Judas's face; he suspected that some devilish plot was hatched, some hideous purpose finally formed. It is the evangelist's way of saying what he personally saw and afterwards concluded. Up to that moment of supreme forbearance, the character was not irretrievably damned, but <span class="accented">now</span> he had sinned against knowledge and love, and even Jesus gives him up. "It were better for him that he had never been born." There is no more awful or tragic touch in the whole narrative, nor any more symbolic of the curse which the corrupt heart can make and bring down upon itself out of the greatest blessing. There is no advantage in trying to determine the amount of figurative sense conveyed by the expression, "Satan entered." The ethical state consequent either upon the sop or the devil is clear enough. The moment when it was induced is signalized in this tragedy. The vehement effort which the traitor must have made to resist all gracious influences opened the way for the powers of hell and darkness to take possession of him. He strengthened himself to do evil. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said to him, That thou doest, do quickly.</span> Questions have been raised as to the sentence - whether it was a solemn command or a permission at once to carry out the purpose that was in his heart (as Grotius, Kuinoel, and others suppose); but Meyer here is more penetrative (so Moulton): "Jesus (as a man) actually wishes to surmount as soon as possible the last crisis of his fate now determined for him." Jameson ('Profound Problems in Theology and Philosophy') urges that it was the prolongation of the struggle which was the bitterest element in Christ's sufferings. The decision at which he had arrived brooked no longer delay. As if he had said, "If you have any manhood in you, and you are not altogether incarnate daemon, make haste, let me remain no longer in suspense; carry out the purpose now and at once." Ambrose, Lucke, Tholuck, suggest that he meant to separate Judas from the eleven, and be rid of his presence. His removal from the group is undoubtedly the condition of our Lord's highest revelations of himself.

It is arbitrary for Keim to say that John <span class="accented">must</span> have known. The whole of this "aside" was the work of a moment. <span class="cmt_word">For certain of them were supposing, because Judas held the purse</span> - or, <span class="accented">box</span> (see note, <a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to him; Buy the things we have need of for the feast</span>; <span class="cmt_word">or</span>, (he spake) <span class="cmt_word">in order that he should give something to the poor</span>. (See Introduction, p. 92, for an explanation of this passage, and the use that has been made of it to settle the question of the day of our Lord's death.) If the great feast of the Jews was to be held on the following day, and this was the 13-14th of Nisan, this advice would be perfectly comprehensible, whereas, if it was the 14-15th when Jesus and also all the Jews were celebrating the Passover, the purchase of any articles would have been contrary to law; and on both grounds the conclusion is drawn that this was the evening of the 13-14tb, and that the Paschal meal had certainly been anticipated by Jesus; but this is not absolutely conclusive, because, even though this were the Passover meal, it is certain that further sacrifices, called "Passovers," were consumed on the great day of unleavened bread that followed the Paschal meal, and it is not perfectly certain what was the custom of the Jews with reference to purchase. Talmudic authorities may be quoted both ways; and a large number of distinguished commentators ( Hengstenberg, Tholuck, Lange, M'Clellan) take the latter view, harmonizing John with the synoptists; but considering all the other difficulties that arise, Meyer, Godet, and Westcott take the former view. The supposition of a gift to the poor from the little stock is very suggestive of the almsgiving spirit that had pervaded all the habits of disciples taught by Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-5.htm">John 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hengstenberg urges that the night of the Passover was that above all others on which the poor needed help to rejoice before the Lord.

The immediate departure of Judas when he had taken the sop is compatible with all the context - a horror of the shadow of death falls on the tragic scene. He at least passes out into the outer darkness, apt symbol of his soul and of his deed. Hengstenberg imagines the Lord's Supper to have followed the previous words, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> must be interpreted with some laxity, leaving time for the sacred meal to have been instituted and the solemn song to have been sung. It is difficult to say where the Eucharistic service is to be introduced, and every possible suggestion has been made. The statement of <a href="../../par/luke/22-21.htm">Luke 22:21, 22</a> makes it probable that the traitor was present at it. And all the synoptists make the indication of the traitor follow the institution of the Eucharist, and two of them place it on the very way to the garden of Gethsemane. Bengel, in harmony with his chronological scheme, supposes that the traitor went out and returned. According to Keim, the Eucharistic meal may be supposed to be introduced at the close of <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14</a>. and before the discourse on the vine; but that discourse follows a summons of Jesus to his disciples to leave the upper chamber. And every attempt to find a place for it in the midst of the valedictory discourse is unsatisfactory (see these amply discussed in Godet, Lucke, Meyer). Thus Paulus, etc., place it after ver. 30. Lucke and Meyer, between vers. 33 and 34; but Peter's question looks back to ver. 33, allowing no such break. Neander and Ebrard place after ver. 32. Tholuck, after ver. 34, Lange identifies it with the new commandment; and Bengel makes the discourse down to <a href="../../par/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a> precede Christ's journey to Jerusalem to keep the Passover, so that no clashing takes place. I think that the simplest solution of the difficulty is to put it at the commencement of the feast, and in the folds as it were of the sentence in <a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>, which tells us that Jesus loved his disciples to the uttermost (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The endeavor made by Strauss, to argue from the silence of the fourth evangelist that he knew nothing of the institution of the Eucharist, is a great exaggeration. The synoptic tradition must, <span class="accented">ex hypothesi</span> of the late authorship of the Gospel, be well known to the author, and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-33.htm">1 Corinthians 11:33</a>, etc., was ample proof of its historic basis. There was, in the entire representation of this Gospel, an intense perception of the inner meaning of the Eucharist, and of the new covenant and commandment based on the assumption of the Passion and death of the incarnate God; so that instead of describing the ceremonial, he expounds its ideas (see Introduction, pp. 105, 106.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver, 31</span> - <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>. - 3. THE VALEDICTORY DISCOURSES OF THE LORD. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The glorification of the Son of man, and of the Father in the Son</span>. With ver. 31 the solemn valedictory discourse of our Lord commences - a veritable <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio</span>, and by the aid of which we come more closely to the heart of Jesus. "Here," as Olshausen says, "we are entering the holy of holies in the Passion-history." We have, indeed, come through the courts of the temple, we have left the courts of the Gentiles, of the women, of the priests behind us, and have been waiting in the holy place of sacrifice and incense and ablution; now we follow our great High Priest to the veil over the holiest of all, and he prepares us to listen to the intercession that he makes before the unveiled majesty of the Father's love. The first section, extending from <a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31-14:31</a>, reports a series of questions by Peter, Thomas, Philip, Jude, which all turn more or less on the anticipated separation which he teaches them to regard as a veritable glorification of the Son of man, and also as a higher revelation to them of the nature of his own Person and of those relations between "the Son" and "the Father" which are imaged and shadowed forth in those between" the Son of man" and "God," which they could more readily understand. This prepares the way for the discourse and prayer which followed, in which the future spiritual union between the victorious Lord and his own disciples, between a sanctified humanity and the eternal Godhead, is exhibited, distinguished by wonderful blending of intuitive insight and supernatural revelation. The discourse is consistent with the stupendous conception which the evangelist had formed of the Person of Christ. Hilgenfeld and ethers regard this address as utterly incompatible with the valedictory discourses of <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24, 25</a>, and <a href="../../par/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>. We have already seen that they are but different aspects of the same mysterious and wonderful Personage; that the synoptists are not silent concerning the spiritual presence of Christ in and with his disciples till the end of the world; and, on the other hand, that the fourth evangelist is perfectly alive to the reality of his kingdom in the world and to the true nature of his second coming. (On the historical character of this discourse, see Introduction, pp. 126, 127.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - (The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> is not omitted by T.R. or Westcott and Holt. It stands on great authority. The different punctuation of Stephens, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f7a;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, dispensed with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>; but this arrangement is not followed by modern editors.) <span class="cmt_word">When therefore he</span> (Judas) <span class="cmt_word">was gone out</span>, and the Lord was left with his trembling but faithful eleven, his heart yearned over them without reserve or exception, and he speaks as though his Passion had begun, and even ended too. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> suggests more than "is glorified." Bengel says, "Jesus passionem ut breve iter spectatet metam potius prospicit." As Son of man, he has secured the highest glory of the most tender, humiliating self sacrifice, has cast out of the covenanted fellowship the hateful, baneful virus of a carnal triumph. To his eye as Son of man the end is secured, just as in <a href="../../par/john/17-10.htm">John 17:10</a> he says, "I have been glorified in them." The thought is certainly complete without the clause appended in T.R., which simply reiterates the last clause, in order to make it the basis of a further thought: God will glorify him in (himself), if his suffering and sacrificed humanity has been the scene and material of a glory given to God, because a new manifestation of the Divine fullness in humanity; that is the reason why his very humanity will be lifted up into the Divine glory, itself becoming one with it, exalted far above these heavens, that he might fill <span class="accented">all things</span>. Elsewhere we read that "Christ is hidden in God" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). All his earthly sufferings will now be seen to be a forth-streaming of Divine love, the fullest revelation of the innermost essence of God (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). Godet says, "When God has been glorified by a being, he draws him to his bosom and envelops him <span class="accented">in</span> his glory." This expression scarcely sustains the sublime uniqueness of the glory of God in the Son of man, and the glory of the Son of man in God. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and will straightway glorify him</span> show how imminent was the glorification which is consummated by the new meaning put into death, and into all that leads to it and into the sacrifice involved in it. That "straightway glorify him" is a note of triumph, and this while Judas is completing his bargain (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> of this verse; cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).

The adoption of the gentle love-word is appropriate as a link to the new commandment, and reveals the love of departure, the tender love that wells up in his heart, as he contemplates the orphan-like and bereft condition of his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">A little while am I still with you.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall seek me</span> in the way of sympathetic love and vivid realization of my spiritual and real presence; <span class="cmt_word">and as I said ante the Jews</span> (a term that Christ used in this place only when speaking to his disciples, though he had made use of it to the Samaritans, and would use it to Caiaphas and Pilate), in <a href="../../par/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33, 34</a>, and John 8:21; but there and then he added, "Ye will not find me," because they would only seek him in carnal ideas and angry disappointment. Observe, he does not here repeat this consequence of the search, because ultimately these disciples would not only seek, but follow and find; nevertheless, he adds: As I said to the Jews, <span class="cmt_word">Whither I go, you are not able to come; so at this time I say to you.</span> There are two words used for "now" - <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> denotes absolutely the present moment; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/9-19.htm">John 9:19, 25</a>, etc.) denotes here and there, a <span class="accented">period</span> distinct from past and future, and yet related to both. The time is not yet come for you to enter into my glory; you cannot yet come, you have to continue my earthly ministry, to prolong the testimony which I have given concerning God, and which God has given concerning me. The time will come when "I will receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also;" but now he prays, "though I am no more in this world, these are in the world holy Father, keep them" (<a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a></div><div class="verse">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The demand which this glorification would make on the mutual fidelity and affection of the disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new commandment I give unto you</span> (<span class="accented">with the purpose and scope</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that ye love one another; even as</span> (or, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I loved you, that ye</span> (<span class="accented">also</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>love one another</span>. The interpretation of this verse largely depends on the meaning given to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span>, if, as many translate it, "even as I loved you;" or, "after the manner and type of my love to you;" then an amply sufficient explanation arises of the <span class="accented">novelty</span> of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. So new a type of love is given that, as the Greek expositors generally have urged, there is a deeper intensity in the love than can be found in the Mosaic principle, Love thy neighbor as <span class="accented">thyself</span>." In this commandment, which embraces the whole law, self-love is assumed, and is made the standard for the love of neighbor. This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, on the other hand, would be based on a new principle, and measured by a higher standard, and even mean more than love of self altogether. Christ's love to his disciples was self-abandoning, self-sacrificing love. This view of the passage is urged by Lucke, and really removes all necessity for the varied translations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, such as "illustrious" (Hammond); "last" (Heumann); "one that is always new" (Olshausen); "renewed commandment," a "renewing commandment" (Augustine and Maldonatus); "the institution of the Eucharist" (Lange). But it is doubtful whether the ideal image of a perfect love constitutes the novelty, and whether the double <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> and the transposition of the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> be found in the simple style of John. If, however, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> be taken as "seeing that," or "since I loved you" (see <a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>), Christ's love becomes not so much the manner or type, as the motive, ground, and principle of love to one another. As if he had said, "I have loved each of you unto death; in loving one another you are loving me, you are loving an object of my tender love. The desire of mere imitation, however strong, is not equal to the demand I make, while the bestowment of the 'new' principle of life arising from a response to my love <span class="accented">is</span>." For the first interpretation speaks John's own use of the idea (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>). There is a third interpretation, which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> a sentence parallel with the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. "Even as up to this moment, and up to my death, and to the uttermost, I have loved you, I <span class="accented">give</span>," etc., "<span class="accented">in</span> order that ye may love one another, and, inspired by me, may imitate my love one towards another" (Westcott). This is an endeavor to combine both interpretations. Alford suggests that the "newness" of the commandment consists in its "<span class="accented">unicity</span>," its being the prime injunction of the new covenant, and the first-fruit of the Spirit (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>.). Tholuck sees the expression of self-renouncing love - the love of the highest to the sinful, the love which is more blessed to give than to receive, the all-embracing love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a></div><div class="verse">By this shall all <i>men</i> know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By</span> (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one toward another</span>. Not by works of majesty and power, but by love to one another. All commentators refer to the well-known saying of St. John at Ephesus, as recorded by Jerome, "This is the Lord's commandment. If ye love one another it is enough" (Tholuck refers to Tertullian's 'Apol.,' 39; Minucius Felix, "They love before they know each other ;" and Lucian, "Their Master makes them believe they are brothers," 'De Mort. Pereg.'). Analogies to the great law of Christ may be found in the Law of Moses, in Talmudical writings, in the Confucian 'Analcets,' and in Stoical maxims; but this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> in its fullness, and as sustained by this motive, or inspired by this pattern, and lifted to this standard, is <span class="accented">new</span> to the human race: and it is the power which has revolutionized thought, society, and life. So long as this great power prevailed, the Church made astounding progress; when the so-called disciples of Christ began to hale and kill one another the progress was arrested. But, thank God, the "new commandment" has always had marvelous power over the Church of Christ.

Peter thought himself ready to die for his Lord, before his Lord had died for him. He who had seen; the glory of the Transfiguration, and the majesty of Christ's power, and the depth of an uttermost love, was ready, as he thought, for any sacrifice, for the most complete self abandonment; but he miscalculated his strength of will and the tenacity of his purpose. "Quid in animo ejus esset cupiditatis videbat, quid virium non videbat" (Augustine). St. Paul, long before St. John made this conversation known, must have gathered from the known teaching of Jesus the same sublime subtle truth, that it is possible to dare a martyr's death, and yet to be without true love (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 3</a>).

In <a href="../../par/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31-35</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/11-27.htm">Mark 11:27-31</a> the announcement of Peter's fate is made on the way to the garden of Gethsemane; Luke's account (<a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>, etc.) may harmonize chronologically with this statement of John; but from all we know of Peter, it is probable that, after his long silence maintained during the discourse of <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14-17</a>, his love may have been so quickened and deepened as to have once more induced the reiteration of his fidelity and his willingness to die for and with his Master, only to receive again a more explicit warning of his weakness. Towards the close of the sixteenth chapter of this Gospel, the Lord warns all his disciples of their inability to stand the tremendous test to which they would soon be exposed. If we reject the "harmony," and refuse to double the prediction, we should be strongly inclined, with Meyer and Lucke, to accept the higher credibility of John's chronology than that of Matthew or Mark. The extraordinary character of this prediction, recorded in all four Gospels, is one of the most vivid proofs of our Lord's supernatural power, and in its detail and definiteness places him among those who claim attention from their absolute knowledge, and not their vague guess of the future. Yet there was no fate in this prediction; for Peter is afterwards warned, entreated, prayed for even, by Immanuel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/14.htm"><title>John 14 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/14.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/14.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/14-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/13.htm" title="John 13">&#9668;</a> John 14 <a href="../john/15.htm" title="John 15">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a></div><div class="verse">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - It is not necessary to follow Codex D and some of the versions, and here introduce into the text <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is enough that the awful warning to Peter, which followed the announcement of the treachery of Judas and his departure, the solemnity of the Lord, and the clear announcement of his approaching death, had fallen like a thunderbolt into their company. Judas held the bag, and was their treasurer, their <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Hatch's 'Bampt. Lect.'), and a referee on all practical subjects and details. He had turned against the Lord; and now their spokesman, their rock of strength, their most prominent and their boldest brother, the senior of the group, and with one exception the disciple most beloved and trusted by the Master, was actually warned against the most deadly sin - nay, more, a course of conduct is predicted of him enough to scatter them all to the four winds. Is it possible to exaggerate the consternation and distraction, the shrieks of fear, the bitter sobs of reckless grief that convulsed the upper chamber? In the agony of despair, and amid the awful pause that followed the outburst of their confusion and grief, words fell upon their ears which Luther described as "the best and most consoling sermons that the Lord Christ delivered on earth," "a treasure and jewel not to be purchased with the world's goods." Hengstenberg has argued at length that the opening words of the chapter do not point to this scene of deep dejection, but to the conversation recorded in <a href="../../par/luke/22-35.htm">Luke 22:35-38</a>, where our Lord warned his disciples of the career of anxiety and dependence and struggle through which they would have to pass. They must be ready even to part with their garment to procure a sword, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they must be prepared to defend themselves against many enemies. With his characteristic impetuosity Peter says, "Here are two swords;" and Jesus said, "It is enough." He could not have meant that two swords were a match for the weapons of the high priests, or the power of the Roman empire, but that the disciple had once again misunderstood the figurative teaching of Christ, and, like a child (as he was), had, in the intensity of his present feeling, lost all apperception of the future. True, the language of <a href="../../par/luke/22-35.htm">Luke 22:35-38</a> suggests an answer to the question, "Why cannot I follow thee now?" But these words in <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14</a>. more certainly contemplate that query, coupled with the other occasions that had arisen for bitter tribulation. To the faithful ones, to Peter's own nobler nature, and to them all alike in view of their unparalleled grief and dismay at the immediate prospect of his departure, he says, <span class="cmt_word">Let not your heart be troubled</span> - the one heart of you all; for, after all, it is one heart, and for the moment it was in uttermost exacerbation and distress, lie repeated the words at the close of the first part of the discourse (Ver. 27), after he had uttered his words of consolation. The "trouble" from which that one heart of theirs is breaking is not the mere sentimental sorrow of parting with a friend, but the perplexity arising from distracting cares and conflicting passions. The work of love and sacrifice means trouble that nothing but supernatural aid and Divine strength can touch. The heartache of those who are wakened up to any due sense of the eternal is one that nothing but the hand that moves all things can soothe or remedy. Faith in the absolute goodness of God can alone sustain the mind in these deep places of fear, and under the shadow of death. But he gives a reason for their consolation. This is, <span class="cmt_word">Believe in God</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eternal God in all his revelations of himself in the past - in God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who has most completely been unveiled to you now in the word and light and life that have been given to you in <span class="accented">me</span>. Your faith in God will be equal to your emergencies, and, if you live up to such fairly, you will bear all that befalls you (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/11-22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>). But, he adds, as I have been in the bosom of God and have declared him to you, believe also in me, as his highest and most complete Revelation. He claimed from them thus the same kind of sentiment, as by right of creation and infinite perfection God Almighty had demanded from them. There are three other ways in which this ambiguous sentence may be translated, according as both the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> are taken either as indicatives or imperatives, but the above method is approved by the great majority of interpreters from the early Fathers to Meyer and Godet. The Vulgate and Authorized Version and Revised Version make the <span class="accented">second</span> only of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> imperative, and consequently read, "Ye believe in God, believe also in <span class="accented">me</span>," which, in the revelation they had just given of their wretchedness and lack of adequate courage and faithfulness, was almost more than the Lord, in the deep and comprehensive sense in which he was using the word "God," would have attributed to them. The different order of the words in the Greek, bringing the two clauses, "in God" and "in <span class="accented">me</span>," together, gives potency to the argument of the verse, which is that of the entire Gospel.

I go to prepare a place for you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In my Father's house are many mansions</span>; or, <span class="accented">abiding-places</span>, homes of rest and peace and sojourn. "<span class="accented">My</span> Father" is the grandest name of all - the Divine fatherhood, as conceived in the consciousness of Jesus and revealed to them. Had not he who dwelt for ever in the bosom of the Father come forth, as he alone could, to reveal "the Father" and what the Father had been to him in the eternities? "<span class="accented">My</span> Father's house" is the dwelling-place in which devout believing souls would abide forever (<a href="../../par/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). In the vast home filled by my Father's glory and lighted by his smile of recognition and reconciliation, in the high and holy place (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>), are "many mansions" prepared from the foundation of the world (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>). Heaven is a large place; its possibilities transcend your imagination and exceed your charity. Thoma quotes all the grand hopes which Paul's Epistles and that to the Hebrews contain, that Jesus made heaven and home by his presence there (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14, 17</a>), and he supposes that the Johannist put these words into the lips of Jesus. One conclusion forced upon the reader, so far as this passage is concerned, is that there is no reason why this Gospel may not have been written long before the close of the first century. <span class="cmt_word">If it were not</span> <span class="cmt_word">so</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if there were any doubt about it, if the revelations already made do not avail to prove as much as this, if you have been cherishing nothing better than vain illusions on this subject, <span class="cmt_word">I would have told you</span>, for I came forth from God, and know these many mansions well. I would have told you, for all things that I have heard from the Father (up to <span class="accented">this</span> time possible for you to receive) I have made known to you. Here surely is a colon, if not a period. Many interpreters, by reason of the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> which Lachmann, Tischendorf, Westcott, and Meyer believe to be the correct reading, link the following sentence in different ways to the preceding; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, some say <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is equivalent to "<span class="accented">that</span>," and read, "<span class="accented">I</span> would have told you that I go, etc.; but against this is the simple statement of Ver. 3, where Jesus proceeds to say that he <span class="accented">is</span> going to prepare, etc. Others, translating <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "<span class="accented">for</span>," differ as to whether the departure of Jesus and his preparation of a place for his disciples refers to the first or second part of the sentence. Surely the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "<span class="accented">because"</span> or "<span class="accented">for</span>," opens out a new thought based on the whole of that sentence: "Because, seeing if it were not so, I would have told <span class="accented">you</span>," because our relations are so close as to have involved on your part this claim on my frankness, <span class="cmt_word">for I am going to prepare a place</span> - to make ready one of these many mansions - <span class="cmt_word">for you</span>. Over and above the vague mystery of the Father's house, my departure is that of your "<span class="accented">Forerunner</span>," and my presence will make a new resting-place  - it will localize your home. As you have made ready this guest-chamber for me, I am going to make ready a presence-chamber for you in the heavenly Jerusalem. Lange objects to this view of Lucke, Calvin, and Tholuck, that it involves a diffusion of knowledge and revelation among the disciples, of which there is no proof. This does not seem bettered by another rendering preferred by him, viz. "If it were not so, would I have told you I go to prepare a place for you?" But then this mode of interpretation implies a previous definite instruction as to the part he himself was going to take in the furnishing of the heavenly mansion. Of that most certainly there is no proof.

I am coming to you, in my glory and power, and in my victory in you as well as for you over death and Hades, to receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. The full perspective of the Lord's approach to faithful souls is given in the extraordinary pregnancy of the "I am coming." Not until he comes m all his glory will the words be perfectly fulfilled; but the early Church, on the basis of communion with Christ himself in the power of his Spirit, expected that Christ had come and taken to himself one by one those who died in the faith (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>). Thus Stephen expected the Lord to receive his spirit (<a href="../../par/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>); and the dying thief was to be <span class="accented">with him</span>, in Paradise; and Paul knew that to be from home, so far as body is concerned, was to be "at home or present with the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>). "To be with Christ" was "far better" than to labor on in the flesh (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). The highest thought of peace and love was to the apostles union and presence with Christ. Our Lord asserts here that by his very nearness to them he will make their heaven for them. How soon this wonderful idea spread among men! Within twenty years, Thessalonians were comforted about their pious dead, with the thought that they slept in Jesus, and would together with them be "forever with the Lord."

Some valuable manuscripts and versions, also the bulk of the cursives, Cyril and Chrysostom, sustain the T.R.; nor have Hengstenberg or Gorier departed from it. The construction of the amended reading is harsh and awkward, but considering the point-blank contradiction which Thomas gives to the words in Ver. 5, the truncated reading is probably the true one. Great emphasis is laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>. They ought to have known, if they did not know, after his telling them so frequently of the way he was taking through suffering, self-sacrifice, and aloneness, by spiritual processes rather than secular triumphs, by giving his life a ransom for many, by laying it down that he might take it again. He assumes, he even assures them, that whithersoever he may be going, and however vague may be his goal their ideas, they at least must comprehend the way by which he intended to reach it. Peter in any case ought to have been clear about it; more than once had he been rebuked for such worldly conceptions as beclouded his surer judgment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The <span class="accented">question of Thomas</span>, <span class="accented">eliciting from Christ that he was going to the Father</span>, <span class="accented">and that his death was their</span> "<span class="accented">way"</span> <span class="accented">as well as his own way thither</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thomas</span> - true to the character elsewhere attributed to him in this Gospel, of anxious, intellectual striving after truth and reality, with a certain despondency and morbid fear of issues which he could not grasp, and yet with a great love to his Master  - <span class="cmt_word">saith to him, We know not whither thou goest</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> we are still in vague perplexity. "Whither? oh, whither?" Art thou going to the dispersed among the Gentiles? Art thou going to restore the kingdom to Israel? Thou art to be "lifted up;" but how and where art thou to be lifted up? Thou art going - that is all we know, and this ignorance of ours makes us doubt "the way." <span class="cmt_word">How do we knew the way?</span> Is not a knowledge of the goal absolutely necessary to bring into proper light for us the way, the strange mysterious way, thou art taking? There often seems in the language of skepticism much common sense, and in the dry light of science a straightforward honesty; and in reading the memorable reply of our Lord many have felt a lack of directness and recognition of the difficulty of Thomas. But is it really so? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him, I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had learned to know me, ye would have</span> <span class="cmt_word">known</span> (absolutely) <span class="cmt_word">my Father also: from henceforward ye know</span> (by personal experience) <span class="cmt_word">him, and</span> (or, perhaps, even) <span class="cmt_word">ye have seen him</span>. The whole sentence must be taken together. The <span class="accented">whither</span> of Christ is obvious enough, and throws consequent illumination upon the way thither. "The Father's house" is the <span class="accented">whither no one cometh unto the Father</span> (<span class="accented">but</span>) <span class="accented">except through me</span>. Christ  explicitly says <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the entire goal of this wondrous way of his is the Father himself. From the Father he came, to the Father he was moving, not for his own sake only, but also as King Messiah for all his subjects. He suggests <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that mankind generally, as well as his disciples, are anxious to find their way to the Father's house, to the Father's heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to resting and rejoicing in God, and satisfaction in their entire conception of him and relation to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He declares post-lively that this idea of God as Father, this approach to God for every man, is through him - through what he is and what he is doing and has so often described, for them. True, lie had said, in <a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37, 44</a>, that the Father gave to him and drew towards him those who came to him. A fatherly monition and inward working of grace opened men's eyes in Christ to the mystery of true human son-ship of the eternal Father. The statement of this verse supplements the former utterance. They may best understand the way he is taking when they grasp the fact that he is going to the Father to prepare a place for them, and so he becomes "the Way, the Truth, the Life," for all who are coming after him, "following him afterwards" to the Father. Grotius sums up this great saying by regarding Christ as "the Exemplum, Doctor, et Dater vitro eternae;" Luther speaks of it as referring to the <span class="accented">past</span>, <span class="accented">present</span>, and <span class="accented">future</span>; Calvin, as "the Principium, Medium, et Finis;" and Augustine "vera vitae Via;" but each term means more than this. The <span class="accented">way</span> of approach to God is constituted by his simply being the incarnate Logos, by his revealing the mind and nature of God, by his laying down his life for the sheep that he might take it again. In doing this he supplies the method-and motive of holy living. It is not easy to say why our Lord should have added "the Truth and the Life." Maldonatus exclaimed, "Si Christus minus fuisset in respondendo liberalis, minus nobis in hujus loci interpretatione laborandum esset." The two further terms used by himself are probably introduced to throw light upon the way to the Father. Thus there are numerous assurances that he is <span class="accented">the Truth itself</span>, that is, the adequate and sufficient expression of Divine <span class="accented">thought</span>. "All the promises of God are <span class="accented">yea</span> [i.e. are uttered] and <span class="accented">Amen</span> [i.e. confirmed] in him." He is the absolute Truth <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> about God's nature; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the perfect Exponent of God's idea of humanity; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Light of the world; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the Expression of the reality touching the relations between moral beings and God - all the relations, not only those of saints and holy angels, but those of rebels and sinners, whose destiny he has taken upon himself. <span class="accented">He is</span> the Way because he is the whole Truth about God and man and concerning the way to the Father. More than this, and because of this, he adds, "I am the Life" -"the <span class="accented">life eternal</span>," the Possessor, Author, Captain, Giver, and Prince of life - the life in the heart of man that can never die; the occasion, germ, condition, and force of the new lath. It were impossible to imagine higher claim. But he leaves his hearers without any doubt as to his personal and conscious identification of himself with the Father. Hitherto he had not so clearly unveiled himself as in that which he has here said and is now doing. Hence his nearest and dearest only partially knew him. If they had seen all they might have seen, they would have seen the Father also. Then, as though he would close all aperture to doubt about the glory involved in his humiliation, and the way in which his human life had revealed the Father, he says <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>  <span class="accented">- henceforward</span> this must be a fact of your consciousness, that <span class="accented">you do</span> learn and come to <span class="accented">know him</span> by personal experience (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); and as a matter of fact <span class="accented">ye have seen him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). Possibly in the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, involving the notion of a period rather than a moment, the Lord was including the full revelation of the glory of self-sacrificial love given alike in his death and resurrection. And the important thought is suggested that neither the knowledge of God can ever be complete, nor the vision either. Is Thomas answered or no? He is silent, and perhaps is pondering the words, which will lead him, before long, notwithstanding his doubts, to make the grandest confession contained in the entire Gospel, the answer of convinced though once skeptical humanity to the question, "Whom say ye that I am?" The other apostles feel that Christ's words have met the mystic vague fear of Thomas, and that "henceforward" they all belong with Christ to the Father's house. They would go to the Father, and at the right time dwell in the place prepared for them; but how can they be said to know and have seen the Father already - to have passed into the light or received the beatific vision?

He is described as convinced of the Messianic character of Jesus, and able, by what he had seen and heard, to overcome all prejudices. Philip, with practical mind, took part in the conversations and preparations for our Lord's great miracle on the loaves. Philip was thought of as a suitable person to introduce the Greeks to Jesus: and every hint we obtain about him is graphic and valuable. <span class="cmt_word">Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us</span>. This query is a very natural one. Though under ordinary circumstances men cannot with mortal eyes look on God, yet one of the high purports of the Christian revelation is to make it possible that men may look and live. Theophanies of Jehovah are not infrequent. The favored prophets, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Elijah, Isaiah, Ezekiel and others had been favored with visions of Divine majesty, and it was not unreasonable that the practical Philip, who believed in the invincible assent which personal experience would give, who not only had seen in Jesus the Messiah of their prophecies, but had said to Nathanael, "Come and <span class="accented">see</span>," and be as satisfied as I am, should now think that some gorgeous vision of the Father's face was possibly within their reach and within Christ's power to confer - a vision which would for ever scatter their doubts and enforce certitude with plausibility. B. Weiss suggests that some whisper of the Transfiguration-glory had escaped from the favored three, leading the other disciples to desire a corresponding theophany. As Luther says, "His faith flutters up into the clouds." A dazzling spectacle would satisfy and suffice for all needs. To see and know the Father, to have irresistible evidence that the Eternal Power is one who has begotten us from himself, and both knows and loves us, is the highest and most sacred yearning of the human heart. The desire is implanted by God himself. Philip, with his fellow-disciples, had not vet learned the sacred truth that they had already had the opportunity of seeing in the life of the God Man the most explicit manifestation of the Father. A dazzling phenomenon, outside of Christ, might have given to the disciples a new impression of awe and fear like that which fell on Moses and the elders of Israel, on Isaiah and Elijah; yet a far more comprehensive revelation of Divine perfection, inspiring the spirit of obedience, reverence, trust, and love, devotion, and self-sacrifice, had already been made to them, but their eyes were holden. They were not satisfied, or Philip would not have said <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>.

Our Lord first of all appeals to that fact; and yet fact, reality as it <span class="accented">was</span>, the disciples had failed even to know <span class="accented">him</span>, inasmuch as they had not seen in him the Father. He thus confirms the statement of Ver. 7. "<span class="accented">There</span> is an evident pathos in this personal appeal the only partial parallels in St. John are cf. <a href="../../par/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a> (Mary); <a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a> (Simon, etc.)" (Westcott). There is no right understanding of Jesus Christ until the Father is actually seen in him. He is not known in his humanity until the Divine Personality flashes through him on the eyes of faith. We do not know any man until we know the best of him. How far more true is it of God and of the Father-God revealed in the Christ? <span class="cmt_word">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father</span>. The "seeing" here must be adequate, comprehensive vision. <span class="cmt_word">How</span> <span class="cmt_word">sayest thou</span> - emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">Show us the Father</span>? Philip, by the hints already given of him, might have discarded the Jewish and crude idea of a physical theophany. "How sayest thou?" reveals that sense of failure which Christ experienced when he sought to realize in the poor material of our human nature his own ideal.

Philip had heard in an inverted order these very words (see <a href="../../par/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>). He might have grasped their meaning; two aspects of the same Divine truth or reality - the reciprocal fellowship between the Father and the Son, between the Father and the Effulgence of the Father's glory who is now the God-Man. I am in the Father, I the God-Man am in the Father, as the Logos has ever been in him and proceeding from him. I, who was forever in the bosom of the Father in heaven though on earth, am in the Father now, as the sun dwells in its own effluent light; and the Father is in me, seeing I am the Image of his substance, the Agent of his purpose, the Speaker of his words, the Doer of his works. The words (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) which I speak (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, R.T.) unto you - those words which are "spirit and life" (<a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>), those "words of eternal life," according to Peter's grand confession (<a href="../../par/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68, 69</a>) - I do not utter (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>) from myself; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are the words of the Father, and also the proof that I am in the Father, but the Father worketh always and ever more in and through the Son, these works which may seem to be mine as the Son of man, but are the operation of the Father himself, he who abides in the Son. <span class="cmt_word">And the Father abiding in me, doeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his works.</span> These works of mine (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) are all signs (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of my relation to the Father.

My words are spirit and life, and carry their own evidence with them. Christ is not here antithetically contrasting (as Lange suggests) words and works, as though the words were his, and the works the Father's; but he is appealing to their spiritual intuition of truth which is legible by its own light as eternal and Divine, and then reminding them that they may fail in transcendental vision and fall back on reason and its processes, which will come nearer to their understanding - <span class="cmt_word">Or else</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>), if it be after all that you cannot take my words as the Father's words, as the utterance of the Divine thought, <span class="cmt_word">believe me</span> - believe that I am in the Father, etc. - <span class="cmt_word">by reason of the very works</span> which are the witness of the Father's power, holiness, and love. In this last appeal he turns from Philip to the whole group of the apostles. Miracles are, if not primary evidence, secondary and convincing evidence, where the eye has been blinded by the mists of doubt, and the vision of the Father confused and withheld by lack of inward purity. Moreover, by Christ's <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> are meant, not merely the supernatural portents, but all the work of his life, all the healing of souls, all the conversion of souls, all the indubitable issues of his approach to the heart of man. The great <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is salvation from sin, the gift of righteousness, and the life where before there was moral death (see notes, Vers. 19,20; <a href="../../par/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater <i>works</i> than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The <span class="accented">greater works</span>, <span class="accented">and their conditions and issues</span>, He offers a fresh ground of consolation, based on the double consideration, first of his departure from them and abiding presence with them, and then on the reflex effect on their own faith and on the world of their consciousness of union with him. He throws the arms of his love round about, not only the eleven disciples, but all believers on him, and in a sense draws them up into his own Divinity. With these words must be compared the closely parallel words addressed to them (as preserved by <a href="../../par/matthew/21-22.htm">Matthew 21:22, 23</a>) a few days before. This was a saying at once explaining the reference to the "greater works" and also to the power of prayer (see Hengstenberg's masterly treatment of this passage). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily</span> - with a fresh emphasis he turns now, not from Philip to the eleven, but from the eleven to all who will believe on him through their word - <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you, He that believeth on me</span> - observe here a nominative absolute, which gives great emphasis to the universality of the reference; the form is slightly varied, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Ver. 11, - believeth, trusteth <span class="accented">on me</span>, confides in me, by reason of believing me - <span class="cmt_word">he also shall do the works that I do</span> (see for similar emphasis procured by the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/6-57.htm">John 6:57</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>). The disciples might naturally have reasoned on this wise: "Our Master is the incarnate Word, the very Hand and Grace of the Father; but he is going to the invisible Father, and wilt be lost in light. His series of proofs will be at an end; we shall only have the memory of them. The glory of God is great, but, like a gorgeous sunset, its flames will die away into the night." To rectify such fear for all the ages of the Church, he adds, "The very works of healing and helping men, even of raising the dead, and preaching glad tidings to the poor and needy, - these will be proofs of the union of the believer in all time with me and with my Father." In the case of such believer, as well as in my case, the works may increase the faith of others. They are not indispensable, but comforting and reassuring, and they show that every believer is near to the heart of the Father and wields the power of God. But the full force of this somewhat perplexing sentence is heightened and to some extent explained by the addition: <span class="cmt_word">And greater works than these he shall do; because I am going to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>. Greater works than any wrought by the Lord in the days of his humiliation are predicted of Messiah. He is to be the "Light of the Gentiles" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.). He is to rule the world, to cover the earth with the glory of God. How he was to do this was hidden from the disciples, but it would soon appear that they were the instruments, in his loving hands, for world-victories. Nay, more than that, Jesus (<a href="../../par/john/4-36.htm">John 4:36-38</a>) had told these disciples that they might reap what he had sown. These rather than other and more surprising prodigies of supernatural energy (as even Bengel supposed was his meaning, pointing, to the healing energy of Peter's shadow, etc.) were the greater works to which he probably (<a href="../../par/john/5-20.htm">John 5:20</a>) referred, though he gives a reason which would check all presumption: <span class="accented">Because of going to the Father</span>. The contrast, then, is between the humiliation and exaltation of Christ, between works wrought in his flesh and those that would be done by him when at the right hand of power. Without him, separated from him, independently of his continued and augmented energy working through them, they would do nothing (<a href="../../par/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; comp. here <a href="../../par/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21, 22</a>). In the last passage, in answer to believing prayer, the disciples were told that they would do greater things than wither up the fig tree, or remove the mountain into the sea. Probably (see Hengstenberg) these terms, "fig tree," "mountain," "sea," were used in their prophetic-symbolic sense, and were not hyperbolic promises, but definite prophecies of the overthrow of the Jewish state, and the fall of the Roman power under the word of those who believed on him. These vast privileges and functions are here attributed to "believers," not merely to the apostles, or princes in his kingdom. This extraordinary pro-raise is no disparagement of his supreme authority, but will be proof that he sitteth on the right hand of the Majesty on high. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a></div><div class="verse">And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The great word that follows may hang closely on the "because" of Ver. 12. Whether that be so or not, the power of their hands to perform these greater works is in answer to prayer presented to himself, and their success is nothing less than his own activity. <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever ye ask in my Name, that will I do</span> (see Luther). Here for the first time our Lord uses these words. Frequently (<a href="../../par/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>) he had spoken of the <span class="accented">Father's Name</span>, and in <a href="../../par/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs; but now he suggests a new and vitalizing condition of prayer. Luthardt has suggested that the believer, being "in Christ," prays to the Father, who is also in Christ. But the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is used here in two entirely distinct senses. Others have said, taking "Name" as the compendium of all his perfections, that asking "in his Name" meant in full recognition of his Person and his relation to them and to the Father. The Name of the Son reveals the Father, and by assuming this most excellent Name, and having its fullness of meaning avouched by the Resurrection and Ascension, the Father was truly manifested. Others, again, urge that Christ's "Name" is equivalent to "himself;" and "in my Name" means "in the full consciousness that he is the element in which prayerful activity lives and moves" (Meyer). Surely this passage is the true justification of prayer to Christ himself, as identically one with the Father (see <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>). "This thing I will do" is strongly in favor of this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">That the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> The end of this prayer-offering and the Lord's response is that the <span class="accented">Father</span> may be glorified; the Father who has such a Son is thereby glorified in the grateful love of his children, and <span class="accented">in the Son himself</span>, who is seen thus to be the link between him and his other children. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-14.htm">John 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye shall ask me</span> <span class="cmt_word">anything in my Name</span>, etc., is, omitting the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> clause of the former utterance, a solemn repetition of the promise. The only condition being "in my Name." "Our Lord Christ foresaw that this article would go hard with human reason, and that it would be much assailed by the devil." "What ye ask," says he, "<span class="cmt_word">I will do</span>. I am God, who may do and give all things." The peculiarity of the R.T. lays, indeed, special emphasis on Christ's own power and willingness to receive and answer prayer.

This great saying is enlarged on in the subsequent section - the relation of love to obedience, obedience producing love, and love suggesting obedience and supplying it with motive. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, "the commandments which are peculiarly mine" (see Westcott on <a href="../../par/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9</a>), "as either adopted and reuttered by <span class="accented">me</span>, or as originating in my new relation to you." "Guard them as a sacred deposit, obey them as the only reasonable response you can make to authoritative command." It is somewhat startling to find the great promise that follows conditioned by loving obedience, seeing that love and obedience in any sinful man, love to Christ itself, are elsewhere made the work of the Holy Spirit. But we here come across that which often perplexes the student, viz. the contrast between the general idea of the constant and continuous work of grace in human hearts, and the special manifestation in personal glory and Divine activity of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost.

"Another" implies that Christ had already stood in this position while present with them, helping with tender care their first efforts to stand or serve. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>) distinctly says, "We have now a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous," etc. And in this place (Ver. 17) the coming of the Paraclete was his own true return to his disciples. The following is the substance of Westcott's "additional note" on this word: "The two renderings of <span class="accented">Paraclete</span> as ' Comforter' in the Gospel, and 'Advocate' in the Epistle, are found in the English versions, with exception of Rhenish, from Wickliffe to Authorized Version and Revised Version. In the ancient versions, with the exception of Thebaic, the original word <span class="accented">Paracletus</span> is preserved. Its passive form by all analogous words will not justify here an active or transitive sense, but means 'one called to the side of another' with the secondary sense of helping, consoling, counseling, or aiding him. The classical use is 'advocate,' so used in Demosthenes, not found in LXX. Philo uses it in the same sense, and the rabbinic writers adopt the Greek word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e7;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span>, in opposition to 'accuser.' The apostolic Fathers use the word in this sense, but the patristic writers, Origen, Cyril, Gregory of Nyssa, Use it for ' Comforter.' In 1 John it. I no other word is satisfactory but 'Advocate,' and the suggestion is that the only meaning here that is adequate is that of one who pleads, convinces, convicts in a great controversy, who strengthens on the one hand, and defends on the other. Christ, as the Advocate, pleads the believer's cause with the Father against the accuser (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The Holy Spirit, as the Advocate, pleads the cause of the believer against the world (<a href="../../par/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>), and pleads Christ's cause with the believer (<a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-14.htm">John 16:14</a>)." Archdeacon Watkins has presented a large portion of the Talmudic evidence to the same effect. Thus from the 'Pirke Aboth,' 4:11, "He that keepeth one commandment obtains for himself one <span class="accented">paraklit</span>, but he who committeth one sin obtains for himself one <span class="accented">kattegor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The word was incorporated into the Syrian language, as seen in the Peshito Syriac translation, both of the Gospel and the First Epistle of John. The Advocate who is to be <span class="accented">with</span> the disciples forever, arguing down opposition and silencing cavil, is <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of truth</span>. The abundant proof of this great function of the Holy Spirit is not wanting. There is Christ's promise (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-11</a>). Then in <a href="../../par/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a> and 13, whatever Christ had been to the twelve, that would the other Advocate, Mediator of Divine grace, be to the whole Church when the Lord's earthly manifestation should terminate. The genitive after "Spirit" sometimes denotes its great characteristic (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, "the Spirit of holiness;" <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, "Spirit of bondage" and "of adoption;" but in the same context we have "Spirit of God," "the Spirit;" <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>, "Spirit of wisdom and revelation; cf. also <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>, "Spirit of Christ;" <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>, "the Spirit of glory"); and the idea is that this other Advocate, even the Spirit of truth, shall reveal truth to the disciples, convince them of truth, as Christ had done. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the world cannot receive.</span> There are antipathies between "the world" (as conceived by St. John) and "truth," which will render the world strangely unsusceptible of Divine teaching. Still, since the whole process of conviction is the distinct effect of the Holy Spirit <span class="accented">upon</span> the world (see <a href="../../par/john/16.htm">John 16</a>.), the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> must not mean that the world cannot <span class="accented">accept</span> its convincing power, but cannot exert its power of convincing. Through apostles, who are his organs and representatives, the world will be convinced, and not apart from them. <span class="cmt_word">Because it seeth him not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="accented">- does</span> not behold him in his external revelations - <span class="cmt_word">and knoweth him not</span> by personal experience, "is not learning to know him" as these disciples even hitherto have been able to do in Christ. The world has proved by its rejection of Christ that it cannot behold the Divine energy in him, nor perceive by any inward experience his nature or the real nature of God; <span class="cmt_word">but ye, said Christ, are now learning to know him; for he abideth with you.</span> He has begun his abiding presence with you, <span class="cmt_word">and shall be in you</span>; and this state of things will continue to the end of time. "The future shows that the whole matter belongs to the domain of futurity" (Hengstenberg). The world cannot "receive," because it is dependent on visible things, and it cannot know because it cannot behold. You have no need to <span class="accented">behold</span>, and can and do <span class="accented">know</span> by another process. The passage is very difficult, because, if the world cannot <span class="accented">receive</span> the Spirit by reason of its own unspirituality and ignorance, how is the threefold conviction to be realized? May <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> be regarded in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to seize hold of"? Rost and Palm give the following instances of this use of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in Homer: ' Od.,' 6:81; 8:116; ' II.,' 5:273; Herod., 4:130, etc. (cf. <a href="../../par/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>). If so, the whole of this passage would read, "He will give you another Helper or Advocate, that he may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot <span class="accented">seize</span> (or take from you), because it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye are learning to know him, because he, according to the eternal laws of his being, dwelleth with you, and will be in you, and be altogether beyond the malice of the world."

His departure might be the signal for the most utter sense of desertion, exposure, and peril; and even the promise of another <span class="accented">Advocatus</span> would hardly console them before the time would arrive when he would receive them unto himself; but, says he, <span class="cmt_word">I am coming to you.</span> Much unnecessary comment has here arisen as to whether this coming was the last triumphant <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of which he speaks in part in Ver. 3, - this would be incompatible with the assurances that then the world would and will see him: "Every eye shall" then be prophetic and "see him," and "before him shall be gathered all nations;" or whether this coming be simply his resurrection with his transitory appearances in the flesh; for both of these representations would fail of the full consolation which would terminate their orphanhood. Surely he speaks of his own spiritual coming in the bestowment of the <span class="accented">other Advocate</span>, who, by being with them and in them, would prove to them, notwithstanding his own apparent departure, that he had come again in his glorious fullness of love. In the thought of the early Church the Lord was the Spirit: the glorified Lord, the Christ, who had "<span class="accented">all</span> power in heaven and earth," was manifested, was veritably present, in all the work of the Spirit of God in his Church. The Spirit was not only the Unity of the Father and the Son, the one Self-consciousness of both, but the one Consciousness of the Son of God and Son of man, the uniting Energy which represents the one Personality of the Christ, the Spirit-power which blends all the members of the mystical body with the Head. Throughout the Acts of the Apostles we see that all the great operations of the Holy Spirit are but the energies of the living, reigning Lord.

This seeking for a sign, this eager desire for a great display of power, or judgment, or glory, this restoration of the kingdom to Israel, was the cry of the Jewish heart. Christ's sublime reply to it is given in the restatement of the spiritual law of the kingdom and glory of God. Once more he goes back to the law of love, issuing in obedience.

In Ver. 21 we see the complementary statement, "He that has and keeps my commandments loves me;" here, "He that loves me keeps my Word." In Ver. 21 obedience proves inward love, and may indicate to the world the fact of the Father's love and my own response. Here our Lord is laying down the principle of relation - the law of close intimacy, the conditions of higher knowledge. The keeping of the Word is a certain consequence of holy love. <span class="cmt_word">And my Father will love him.</span> So far Christ has only reiterated the great statement of Ver. 21, but instead of saying, "I will love him, and manifest myself," he added, <span class="cmt_word">We will come</span> - the Father and I - <span class="cmt_word">to him, and take up our abode</span>, make for ourselves a resting-place <span class="cmt_word">in his dwelling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); cf. the analogous and wonderful parallel in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>.

It is worthy of note that such an expression as this sounds a profounder depth of that consciousness than any phrase (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) already delivered. Apart from the stupendous corroborative facts elsewhere on record, this seems, to mere human experience, either awfully true or infinitely blasphemous. <span class="accented">The Father add</span> g will come together in the power of the Spirit, and we will dwell within the loving and obedient soul.

This shows that, while the disciples are to approach the Father "in the Name," in the fullness of perfection involved in the filial Name of Jesus, so the Father sends the Paraelete in the same Name, in the full recognition of Christ as the Sphere of all his gracious work. Meyer emphasizes by it the <span class="accented">Name</span> of Jesus; "<span class="accented">in</span> my Name," say Grotius, Lucke; "at my intercession" or "in my stead" (Tholuck, Ewald); "as my Representative" (Watkins). But the great Name of Jesus is "<span class="accented">the</span> Son" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-5</a>). In the Sonship which he realized and displayed, the Father himself was manifested. The Spirit is sent from the Father fully to reveal the Son, while the substance of the teaching and meaning of the life of our Lord, in his Divine training of souls revealed the Father. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a masculine and emphatic pronoun, which gives personal quality and dignity to the Spirit, and points to all that is here predicated of his agency) <span class="cmt_word">shall teach you all things</span> that you need to know over and above what I have said (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>), and he will assist you to know more than you do now. <span class="cmt_word">He shall remind you of the all things which I have said to you.</span> The teaching of Christ, according to St. John's own statement, was vastly more extensive than all that had been recorded, the impression produced far deeper than anything that could be measured; yet even this would have been evaporated into vague sentiment, if the veritable things, the marvelous and incomparable wisdom, uttered by the Lord had not, by the special teaching of the Spirit, been re-communicated to the apostles by extraordinary refreshment of memory. The supernatural energy of the memory of the apostles, and their profound insight, is the basis of the New Testament, and the fulfillment of this promise. This sacred training will not teach specifically new truths, because the germinant form of all spiritual truth had been communicated by Christ; nor would the instruction create a fundamental deposit of tradition as yet unrevealed; nor is it to be such an intensification or addition to things already said as to contradict the teaching of the Lord; but the Holy Spirit will bring to the remembrance of the apostles all that the living Logos had spoken. Hence the mystic, the traditionist, and the rationalist cannot find support for their theses in these great words. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, however, gives a bright hint of the completeness of the equipment of the apostles for their work.

This is the sacred bestowment and Divine legacy of the Lord. "Peace" is always the result of equilibrated forces, the poise of antagonistic elements, held in check by one another. Of these the most placid lake, hidden in the hills and reflecting the sunshine and shadows, is a remarkable illustration. So the peace Christ leaves is <span class="accented">power to</span> hold the wildest fear in pause, to still a clamor or hush a cry - it is the coming of mercy to a sense of sin, of life to the fear of death. But when he added, <span class="cmt_word">The peace that is mine I give to you</span>, we are reminded of the tremendous conflict going on in his own nature at that very moment, and of the sublime secret of Jesus, by which the will of man was brought, even in agony and death, into utter harmony with the will of God. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> of this verse show how the ordinary salutation may become invested with immense significance. There are moments when into one human word may be condensed the love of a lifetime. Christ does but pour through these common words the fire of his eternal and infinite love. <span class="cmt_word">Not as the world giveth, give I to you</span>, both as to manner and matter and power. The mode of giving is <span class="accented">real</span>, sincere, neither formal nor hypocritical. "I say it, and I mean it." (Meyer, in opposition to Coder, thinks this unworthy of the Savior at this moment; but Godet is right.) The matter, substance, and value of the prosperity and peace I give stretches out into eternity; and <span class="accented">I give</span> it, I do not merely talk of it or wish it. "Christ's farewell greeting is forerunner of the beatific salutation which shall accompany the eternal meeting" (Lange). Then, returning to the Divine words of Ver. 1, he seems to say, "Have I not justified all that I have said?" - <span class="cmt_word">Let not your heart be troubled</span>, harassed by these mysteries or by my departure, <span class="cmt_word">neither let it be terrified</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>). This is the only place in the New Testament where the word occurs, though it is found in the LXX.; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of timidity from extrinsic fear, may frequently be found. He must have seen some rising symptoms of the carnal weakness which would prostrate them for a while. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/14-28.htm">John 14:28</a></div><div class="verse">Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come <i>again</i> unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - Now, however, he leads them a step further. The disciples are to dismiss their trouble and fear, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the many mansions that he is going to prepare; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because he was the "Way" to the Father; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because they have had a theophany in him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> because they shall carry on the work of Christ and fulfill all the prophecies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> and do all this under the power of another Advocate or Helper; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> because he, the Holy Spirit, will indeed reveal him as he (Christ) had revealed the Father; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> because the Father and Son would come and take up their abode in the loving and obedient heart. But the Lord does more - he bids them not only to dismiss their fear and harassment, but even to "rejoice." <span class="cmt_word">Ye heard that I said, I am departing, and, in that very act, I am coming to you.</span> <span class="cmt_word">If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced</span> - a supposition involving uncertainty with a prospect of decision. Perfect love would cast out fear. But why? <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> <span class="cmt_word">I go to the Father</span>, the theme of the whole discourse. But why should this cause you to rejoice? <span class="cmt_word">Because the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father is greater than I!</span> It is not easy adequately to explain this memorable saying. The Arians made use of it to prove, from bur Lord's own lips, that his Person, even his pre-existent Divinity, was less than the Father's; that his essence, admittedly generated by the Father, was created by him, and was not the same as that of the Father. The same view has been held by the rationalistic school. The Socinians and modern Unitarians have insisted on the entire dependence and purely human character of our Lord. The Son of man and Son of God are to many merely the self-chosen titles of the greatest of the sons of men, who thus is supposed to put himself on a level with ordinary men who may learn to call God their Father. But is it? Could any man, unconscious of a far closer relation with God than that of the greatest saint, dare to say, as if to relieve anxiety on that head, "My Father is greater than I"? Is there not in the very phrase a suggestion of Divine sufficiency and relation to the Father which altogether precludes the purely humanitarian position? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> A theological view which has largely prevailed among those who have held the <span class="accented">homoousia</span> of the Father and the Son, is that the Lord was here speaking of his human nature only. The Athanasian symbol says," Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood." But the "I" is here used of his whole Personality, as in <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, and throughout the discourse he is speaking of himself in the Divine-human Person in which the eternal and temporal, the infinite and finite, are indissolubly blended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others have supposed that he referred to himself as in a state of humiliation. Hengstenberg says the Lord was speaking of the pre-eminent greatness of the Father, which came to an end at his departure. Cyril, Luther, Melancthon, De Wette, Tholuck, Luthardt, and Alford think that Jesus spoke these words of the humiliated Christ in his condition of a servant - obedient unto death. The Son, the Logos of God, was that Mode or Personality of Deity by which "God" created the universe, governed mankind, and proceeded by special manifestation - incarnation, life, and death - to redeem the world. Calvin had said, while the Arians have abused this testimony, the orthodox solution of the Fathers was neither harmonious nor sound; the true signification of the passage, according to him, being found in the mediatorial office of the Christ, and in his <span class="accented">status exinanitionis</span>. But this would not exhaust the meaning, for in this very passage he does describe the Father as greater even than the <span class="accented">exalted</span> Christ; and in <a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a> as greater even than the pre-existent Logos. And so <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we are led to see that there is indeed a subordination of rank and order in the Son, involved in the very notion even of an eternal generation; and compatible with the equality of Being and of essence which he shared with the Father. This is undoubtedly confirmed by <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; and has been through the whole history of Christological speculation conceded (Bishop Bull, in his three chapters on the "Subordination of the Son," has shown, by abundant proof, that before and after the Council of Nicaea, the Fathers held "that the Son has indeed the same Divine nature in common with the Father, but communicated by the Father in such sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the Father alone hath the Divine nature from himself, but the Son from the Father; that the Father is the Fountain, Origin, and Principle of the Divinity which is in the Son"). This is abundantly, needful to avoid at once the errors of tritheism, and to maintain the real unity of the Divine Being. Christ's going to the Father was a ground of rejoicing, because his exaltation through death and resurrection to the position of power and majesty unutterable, and the lifting up of his Divine-human Personality to the midst of the throne, gives to him, in his relations with his disciples, the efficacy of the greatness of that Divine nature which, by its own characteristics, could not have become incarnate. The unrevealed God is greater than the revealed. The lifting up of perfect humanity into the glory which the Son had with the Father before the world was, should have been the cause of joy to the disciples. It is the wellspring of joy to the Church (see Suicer, 'Thesaurus,' art. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; Bull's 'Defense of the Nicene Creed,' bk. 4; Westcott's catena of passages in 'Additional Note to <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14</a>;' Lange and P.

Christ often appeals to the effect which the fulfillment of his own predictions will produce in the minds of his disciples (<a href="../../par/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>). They will, when the series of events will unroll themselves, believe that he has gone to the Father, to do all he said he would do, to be all he said he was. This means undoubtedly more than a spiritual consolation whereby they may endure his separation by <span class="accented">death</span> from their society. It is the announcement beforehand of the Resurrection and Ascension, by which their faith in his exaltation would be fanned into burning flame and made a revelation of Divine love to the universe.

This term is continually found in rabbinical writings for the great central power of evil in the world. The activity of evil was then at work. Satan entered into Judas; the spirit of evil was rampant in all the machination of the leaders of the people. The eagles of this impure host were gathering. The last conflict impended. The prince of the world, who shall be cast out, judged and conquered, <span class="cmt_word">cometh, and hath nothing in me</span>. The conflict between the second Adam and the devil culminates. Christ looks through the whole army of his opponents, and feels that he has to wrestle with the ruler of the darkness of the world, but at the same time is sublimely conscious that there is nothing in him on which the evil can fasten. Christ certainly claims a sinlessness of inner nature which no other saint has arrogated to himself. Accusations of the world were numerous enough, but those who brought them were ignorant. Now he has to do with one who knows him, but not so well as he knows himself. The double negation, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, must be noticed - "absolutely nothing." Thus he virtually repeats his own utterance, "I am not of this world." This great word presupposes again the uniqueness of Christ's Personality and consciousness. With every other man the higher the conception of the Divine Law and claim, so. much the deeper becomes the sense of departure from it. In Christ's case his lofty knowledge of the Father only makes him know, and even compels him to confess, his reconciliation, his obedience, and his inward sinlessness.

The image of the vine may have been suggested by some visible object. Either of the hypotheses of place would furnish a reminder of the nature and culture of the vine. Thus around the windows of the guest-chamber the vine may have thrown its tendrils, or on the slopes of Olivet the vineyards may have been prominent objects, or the burning heaps of vine-prunings may have suggested the idea. Again, if they were pausing in some apartments of the temple-court, the golden vine, the image of Israel, upon the gates may have supplied the point of departure. But our Lord needed no such help to his imagination, and it is by no means necessary to find an occasion for his imagery. The fact that he had the fruit of the vine before him, and had already made it symbolic of his sacrificial death, may have brought the thought nearer to the disciples. But the most simple explanation is that the vine was the image of Israel. The prophets and psalms abound with this reference (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-19</a>), so that our Lord was giving a new meaning to a familiar figure. "The vine" was the beautiful image of that theocratic and sacramental community, which had its center in the altar and ark of testimony and the holy place; and the fruit of the vine was conspicuous in all the symbolic relations which, through priesthood and ritual enactments, brought individual Israelites into relation with the reconciled God. Here Christ says, "I;" but we see from Ver. 5 that the branches, which by reason of relation to him have and draw their life from him (or, to use his own words, "I and the branches," and "the branches in me"), constitute the veritable "vine" of the covenant. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The vine of the Lord of hosts (<a href="../../par/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>.) brought forth wild grapes (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>); Israel became "<span class="accented">an</span> empty vine" (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>). The failure of Israel to realize the ideal leads our Lord, as the true Israel of God, to say, <span class="cmt_word">I am the veritable</span> (or, <span class="accented">ideal</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>vine</span>, including (as the context shows) in the idea of his complete Personality all the branches that derive their life from him. I with the branches, I involving my relation to the branches, and theirs to me - I as the Life-principle of humanity, together with those who are living in me - constitute and are the veritable vine of prophecy, the true Israel of God. So that this passage, from Vers. 1-10, denotes and expounds with all detail the idea elsewhere expressed by the head and the members of a body. Sometimes the idea of the parts predominates over the idea of the unity, and sometimes the unity triumphs over the parts; but in the relation between Christ and the people of his love they are often lost sight of in him, and he becomes the only Personality. The "I" of this passage is not that of the eternal Logos, nor is it the mere humanity, nor is it simply the Divine-human Personality, but the new existence which, by union with him, formed one personage with him, - the believer being united to him as he to the Father. <span class="cmt_word">My Father is the Husbandman</span>, not simply the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">o</span>r vinedresser, but also <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the owner of the land as well. It is a term applied in connection with the traditional significance of the vine to the head of the theocratic family. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>. it is the "Lord of hosts;" in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a> and in the parable of the vinedressers it is applied to the rulers of the people. The Arians were wrong in concluding from this a difference of essence between the Father and Son. The vine dearly includes the branches; and the owner of the vineyard, who is also the dresser of the vine, deals here with the whole reality. All, however, which the Husbandman is said in Ver. 2 to effect is the taking away of the fruitless though proud branch, and the cleansing and gentle pruning of the branch that beareth fruit. Now, Christ, as the Son, has all judgment committed to him, and, as the great Organ of Divine providence and rule in the Church, he is the Administrator of discipline. Christ is not disclaiming the  operations which he in other places assumes, nor representing his own Personality as perfectly passive in the matter, but he is claiming for Jehovah of hosts the same relation to the true Vine as he sustained to the degenerate vine of the old covenant; but he calls him "my Father." Alford says, "The material creations of God are only inferior examples of that finer spiritual life and organism in which the creature is raised up to partake of the Divine nature" (see Hugh Macmillan, D.D., 'The True Vine').

Then it is possible to come into this organic relation with the true Vine, to be in it and to be a part of it, and to bring forth <span class="accented">no</span> fruit. If it were not for Ver. 5 we might say that these branches were nations, customs, institutions, and the like; but the context forbids it. The relation to him must therefore be one that is insufficient to secure life, or fruit, or continuance. Baptized, communicating, professing, partially believing Christians there may be in abundance, who, though in him, yet cannot continue in him. (See stony ground, thorny ground, and unripe ears, of the parable of the sower; and the bad fish caught in the net (<a href="../../par/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He taketh away</span> (cf.

The Husbandman aims at more fruit, more of meekness, gentleness, love, and faithfulness, in fact, all those <span class="accented">fruits of the Spirit</span> enumerated in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, used for "branch" in these verses, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, elsewhere used (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-32.htm">Mark 4:32</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-28.htm">Mark 13:28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16-21</a>), means the smaller "branches" of a tree. The term means here vine-branch, the essential constituent elements of the vine itself, and is so used in Aristophanes, AEschines, and Theophrastus (see LXX., <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a>).

As we find in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, the Word is sharper than a two-edged sword, and capable of dealing summarily with "thoughts and intents of the heart." Augustine, on this passage, admits that it is the <span class="accented">Logos</span> which gives all its value to the water of baptism. "This purifying, sanctifying process has been performed upon you," says Christ. Then since "he who sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one," this continuance remains as the gracious possibility. The vital sap proceeds from Christ alone, and not from our corrupted nature, which must be grafted into his life and become part of him. Many may seem to be a part of Christ, to be sacramentally or outwardly united to him, and even to be drawing some real advantages from the contact, and yet their end is fruitlessness, rottenness, removal, fire. The branches which bear fruit never bring forth all they might produce, never realize their ideal. The pruning, cleansing process must pass over every soul, that it may more adequately fulfill its destiny. The cleansing, searching power of the Word will be freely exercised by the Divine Husbandman. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a></div><div class="verse">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - But there is a continuance of most intimate relations to be sustained between Christ and his disciples. If the two clauses are "imperative," or rather concessive, as many suppose, the finest meaning is evolved. Let these be the reciprocal conditions, let it be that <span class="cmt_word">you abide in me, and I in you.</span> (Meyer and Lange add to the second clause <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;</span>, "I will abide in you," making it into a promise following a command, and involving a very strong synergistic thought.) There is a mutual abiding or indwelling. The life-principle circulates through the branches, just as they perpetuate the living connection between the branch and the center of the life. The mutual relations show that human nature is in infinite need, and, apart from the new life-principle, will perish. The abiding of the branch in the vine suggests the continuance of vital connection' with the living stem, and supposes that connection kept up by constant faith, so that the believer is in a position to draw life from the legitimate source. The abiding of the vine in the branch - "I in you" -is the perpetual inflow into the subordinate life, of the living grace which makes the believer's life one with his Lord's. As he said (<a href="../../par/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>), "Because I live, and ye shall live;" so now, <span class="cmt_word">As the branch cannot bear fruit from itself</span> - from its own inherent vitality - <span class="cmt_word">except it abide in the vine</span> - except this connection is maintained - <span class="cmt_word">in like manner no more</span> (or, <span class="accented">so neither</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>can ye, except ye abide in me</span>. The affirmation does not cover, as Augustine implies (although it may suggest), the impotence of the natural man, but it asserts the unfruitfulness of the disciple in his own strength. Some have found here revindication of the place of the human will in the work of grace. Let it be seen, however, that it is the "good will," the new nature, which has been wakened into normal activity, and which wills the thing most pleasing to the Divine Source of the life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">I am the vine, ye <i>are</i> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Christ returns to the main theme of the previous verse, but here discriminates more forcibly the vine from the branches, and yet holds and binds them into a unity. <span class="cmt_word">I am the vine, ye are the branches</span>; which shows that he treated the disciples themselves as the organs of his earthly fruit-bearing; and then draws a larger circle and makes a complete and comprehensive statement on which the very existence of the "true vine," the "body of Christ, including the Head," depends, viz. <span class="cmt_word">He that abideth in me, and I in him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever the conditions of which I have spoken to you are fulfilled; wherever there are human souls deriving from their connection with me the full advantage of the life ever streaming forth from me - <span class="cmt_word">the same beareth much fruit</span>; the entire end of their new life is secured. He beareth "much fruit." In other words, many of those blessed fruits of the supernatural life appear, which the great Husbandman desires to receive. And this strengthens the position of the previous verse, which threatened excision from the vine to such as bear no fruit. Such, though in one sense "in the Vine," do not <span class="accented">abide in him</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Because apart from</span>  - severed from - <span class="cmt_word">me ye can do nothing</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> suggests the question - Can the negative result justify the positive assertion? It does in this way. There are two premises: the first is," I am the Vine, and ye are the branches," and the second is, "Severed front me a branch can effect nothing," having no independent fruitfulness or stability. All its powers are derived from this supernatural source, and depend on Christ's faithfulness to his own nature and functions; <span class="accented">therefore</span>, "He that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much fruit." The language here does not repress the endeavor of the human will after righteousness, nor pronounce a judgment on the great controversy between <span class="accented">Augustinians</span> and Pelagians. These words are not addressed to unconverted men, but to disciples, who have to learn their constant need of spiritual contact with their invisible Lord. Let a believer, let an apostle, sever himself from Christ, and live on his own past reputation or his supposed strength, on the clearness of his intellect, the vigor of his body, the eminence of his position, <span class="accented">he can and will do nothing</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a></div><div class="verse">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast <i>them</i> into the fire, and they are burned.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any one abide not in me, he is cast forth as the branch</span> - perhaps away from the vineyard, as well as from proximity to the vine - <span class="cmt_word">and is withered</span>. The two aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, are simply cases of a common daily experience. These are the inevitable consequences of not abiding in the Vine. We may imagine two ways in which this non-abiding in Christ, this severance from him, may be effected: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the pruning-knife may have lopped them off because of their lack of fruitfulness; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> they may have withered on the stem, and, by their deficiency of strength and life, have suffered from some external assault which they have not had energy to resist. Lucke, Winer, Tholuck, and Hengstenberg regard the aorists as indicative of what will happen should branches in Christ cease to derive life from him. Calvin is satisfied that the expression cannot refer to the elect, but to the hypocrite, while Alford is as confident of its repudiation of unconditional election. In my opinion it keeps clear of both suggestions. <span class="cmt_word">And they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> The vine is one of the noblest of all trees, and produces the most abundant fruit; but it is one of its peculiarities that all its strength is spent on the fruit, and that its branches are utterly valueless for all other purposes. Heaps of burning vine-prunings may have suggested the awful image which the embodied Love of God here adopts. Some have supposed (Meyer and Alford) that the fire is here the last judgment, which our Lord looks upon as come. But the present tense, following the two aorists, suggests the immediate consequence of such severance from Christ - the fiery trials, the fierce temptations, the terrible judgments, always overtaking the unfruitful and unfaithful servants, and preluding the awful consummation of Divine judgment, of which our Lord had often spoken (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-42.htm">Matthew 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>), and which the apostle of love described in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>.

The disciples may be sorely distressed at this possible doom, for whatever may be the lot of those who do not obey the gospel and are ignorant of the Law of God, the curse here uttered fails heavily upon those who have been once enlightened, etc., and have apostatized (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>). The anxiety of the apostles ]s grievous, and they desire deliverance from this doom. And our Lord next unfolds the principle of prayer which laid such hold on the mind of the Apostle John: If ye abide in me (and <span class="accented">then</span>, instead of adding, "And I abide in you," he says); <span class="cmt_word">and my words abide in you</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if my teaching so abide with you as to control your thoughts and ideas, remain in you as your guide and inspiration, then <span class="cmt_word">ask</span> <span class="cmt_word">whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done to you.</span> A timid interpretation of this promise limits the "whatsoever" to deeds of service in the kingdom of God, and fears, with Augustine, to trust the sanctified will of the believer. But in such harmony with Christ as these words supply, all the conditions of acceptable prayer are present. The believer in Christ, full of his words, evermore consciously realizing union with Christ, charged with the thoughts, burning with the purposes, filled with words of Jesus, will have no will that is not in harmony with the Divine will. Then faith is possible in the fulfillment of his own desire, and prayer becomes a prophecy and pledge of the answer. The apostle, after many years of pondering and of putting these principles into practice, confirms the truth of them (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-16</a>). This is the true philosophy of prayer. The psalmist had gone a long way in the same direction (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>, "Delight thyself in the Lord; and he shall give thee thy heart's desire"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Here the Lord shows what he knows will be and must be the dominant desire of the man who abides in himself, in whom his own word abides. Such a man will seek, yearn, ask, that he should <span class="cmt_word">bear much fruit</span>. This prayer will be heard, and <span class="cmt_word">in this</span> sublime synthesis between Christ and his disciples, says Christ, <span class="cmt_word">was my Father glorified</span>. "In the fruitfulness of the vine is the glory of the husbandman," and in the answer of your prayers, and the regulation of all your desires, <span class="cmt_word">so ye shall become my disciples</span>. "Discipleship" is a very large word, never altogether realized. Just as faith leads to faith, and love to love, and light to light, so does discipleship to discipleship. As Bengel says, discipleship is the <span class="accented">fundamentum et fastigium</span> of Christianity. On earth the vine reveals itself in the branches, and thus conceals itself behind them. "This explains why the diffusion of spiritual life makes such slow progress in the world - the Vine effects nothing but by means of the branches, and these so often paralyze instead of promoting the action of the Vine" (Godet). If the other text be maintained, <span class="accented">Herein was my Father glorified</span>, <span class="accented">so that ye might bear much fruit</span>, <span class="accented">and that ye may become my disciples</span>, the "herein" points back to the previous verse, and then the contemplated result of the arrangement, rather than the purpose of the glory, is the matter referred to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9</a></div><div class="verse">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Two ways of explaining this verse: <span class="accented">Even as - inasmuch as - the Father hath loved me</span>, <span class="accented">and as I have loved you</span>, <span class="accented">abide in my love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Grotius has put it, the first clause suggesting accordance with the mystery of the Trinity, and the second the mystery of redemption: "So do ye continue, or so do ye abide, in the amplitude of this double love which is mine, dwell in it as in a holy atmosphere, breathe it and live by it." But there is another and more satisfactory way of translating the passage<span class="cmt_word">: Even as the Father loved me, I also loved you</span>; a fact of stupendous interest and transcendent claim. Heaven had opened over the incarnate Word, and other ears as well as his own had heard the Father say, "Thou art my beloved Son," etc. The Lord was conscious of being the Object of this infinite love before the foundation of the world (<a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>), and of reciprocating and responding to it; and this love of the Father to him on his assumption of his mediatorial functions was the well-spring of his obedience unto death and after it (see <a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>, note). Now, if the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is to be translated as above, Christ declares that <span class="accented">even as</span> the Father has loved him, he has' loved his disciples. Again and again he has emphasized this love to them (<a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>), but here he asserts a loftier claim, viz. that his love to them corresponds with the eternal Father's love to himself. The one great fact is the ground on which he commands them to <span class="accented">abide in his love</span>. This is obviously a more explicit and more intelligible form of the commandment to abide in him. With Olshausen and Westcott, "The love that is mine "is not the love to Christ, nor the love <span class="accented">of</span> Christ exclusively, but a blending of the active and passive idea in "the love that is mine" - in the "love" lavished upon me from eternity, and to which I have eternally responded, which I have made known to you and expended on you and received back again from you. <span class="cmt_word">Abide in that love that is mine.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love</span>. This is the method and secret, the stimulus and proof, of abiding in the love of Christ. This is not exactly the converse (Westcott) of "If ye love me, keep my commandments." Doubtless there is a love which dictates obedience to the loved One's will. Our Lord here avers, however, something further, viz. that obedience issues in a <span class="accented">higher love</span>. The obedience here described is the outcome of love, but the power is thus gained to continue, dwell, in the Divine love, to abide, that is, in the full enjoyment and fullness of my Divine love to you. This is obvious from the confirmatory clause: <span class="cmt_word">Even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span> The Lord kept the Father's commandment always, doing those things which please him, offering up his precious life, laying it down that he might take it again; and the consequence is that he then and there knew that he was filled with all the fullness of the Divine love. The very impressive line of thought pervades this passage, that what the Father was to him, that he would prove to his disciples. What the love of God was to the Christ, the love of Christ was to his disciples. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <i>that</i> your joy might be full.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="../../par/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a>. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The <span class="accented">results of the union between Christ and his disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - (a) <span class="accented">To themselves</span>. The Lord moves into another and wider development of the union between himself and his disciples. He drops the metaphor of the vine and the branches, and comes to the essence of the relation between them; that is, he does much to explain the meaning and nature of his abiding in them, and the character of the fruit which they were expected by the great Husbandman and Father to bring forth and ripen. A connection between the second section and the first is revealed in the new beginning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things I have spoken, and am still speaking, to you</span> (perfect, not aorist) with this purpose, <span class="cmt_word">that the joy that is mine may be</span> <span class="cmt_word">in you</span>. This is variously explained. Augustine, "My joyfulness concerning you," which is scarcely the burden of the previous verses; Grotius, "Your delight in me," which would be somewhat tautologous; Calvin and De Wette, "The joyfulness capable of being produced in you by me, might be in you." But the words are more simply explained by Lange, Meyer, Lucke, Westcott, Alford, and Moulton, as the communication to his disciples of his own absolute and personal joy. "The joy that is mine," like "the peace which is mine," is graciously bestowed. A joy was set before him, the joy of perfect self-sacrifice, which gave to his present acts an intensity and fullness of bliss. It was this, in its motives and character and supernatural sweetness, which would be in them. If they receive his life into them, it will convey not only his <span class="accented">peace</span>, but that peace uprising and bursting into joy; and he adds, <span class="cmt_word">in order that your joy may be fulfilled</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. <span class="cmt_word"></span>perfected</span>, reach its highest expression, its fullness of contents and entire sufficiency for all needs. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-4</a> is the best commentary on this last clause. The Old Testament prophets had often spoken of Jehovah's joy in his people, comparing it to the bridegroom's joy, and the bride's (<a href="../../par/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). This entire idea is linked with Ver. 10; where the keeping of his commandments, from motives of love, will enable the disciples to "abide in his love." He now passes the whole law of the second table into the light of his joy and the power of his example. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I loved you.</span> This (<a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>) was given as a "new commandment;" now he gathers the many commandments into <span class="accented">one</span>, as though all were included in it (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>). This thought is further vindicated by an endeavor to explain in what sense and way he was loving them.

Meyer and Lange endeavor to maintain even here the telic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "The love to you is of so consummate a character, that its object and purpose is seen in my laying down my life for my friends;" and Hengstenberg thinks so because probably a reference here is made to <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, that our Lord was pointing to his atoning death - to a death needed alike by enemies and friends. Such an interpretation supposes the lofty purpose of the greatest love. To me, however, it seems more probable that the translation given above places the argument upon a surer; because more common, human, experience. The disposition to die for ungodly and for enemies is exalted by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>) above the self-sacrifice involved in dying for the good. Still, which may be shown, and has often been shown in self-sacrificing death for those who are beloved, whatever other and wider ends may be discerned afterwards and spoken of in other connections, he is here asserting that the love of friendship is quite strong and intense enough to secure such a sacrifice. And he adds -

So the natural conclusion will be, "I am showing you the highest possible fruit of my friendship - I am laying down my life for you. This is how I have loved you; therefore after this manner you are to love one another" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1, 2</a>).

True, he had in this very discourse spoken of them as his <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, (<a href="../../par/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13, 16</a>). Again and again in his parabolic teaching he had spoken of his disciples as servants of a Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-27.htm">Matthew 13:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-4.htm">Matthew 22:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>; and <a href="../../par/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>, where another word is used). And moreover, later on in this very chapter (Ver. 20), the word and thought return, so that this relation to him, gloried in by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>), St. James (<a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>), Jude (<a href="../../par/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>), and even St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>), could be sustained in its integrity, even after it had been transfigured, and penetrated through and through with the light of love. <span class="cmt_word">Because the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.</span> The slave is an instrument, doing by commandment, not from intimate knowledge, his Lord's behests. <span class="cmt_word">But you I have called</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) - on previous occasions (see <a href="../../par/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>; and cf. <a href="../../par/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>, "Our friend Lazarus") - <span class="cmt_word">friends</span>, for whom it is joy to die, and I have effected the transfiguration of your service into love. I have raised you by the intimacy of the relations into which 1 have drawn you from the position of slave to that of friend. You may be, you must be, my servants still; I am your Master and Lord; but you will be servants from a higher motive and a more enduring link and bond of union. <span class="cmt_word">For all things which I heard of my Father.</span> Notice the source of the Savior's teaching. He was sent from God, trained and taught, as a man; he chose thus, humanly, to learn step by step, thing by thing, what to reveal of his own nature, of his purpose and plan in redeeming men, concerning the essence of the Father himself, and the entire significance of his self-manifestation. That which I heard <span class="cmt_word">I made known unto you.</span> This is only in apparent contradiction with <a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>, where he implies that there will be more for them to learn in the future, when the mystery of his death, resurrection, and ascension shall have been accomplished. The limitation of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> does not consist in <span class="accented">doctrines</span> as opposed to practical <span class="accented">duties</span>, nor in the plan of salvation for individuals as antithetic to principles of his kingdom, nor in principles as distinguished from what may ultimately be found in them, but in the capacities and circumstances of the disciples themselves (<a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a> is a corollary of this solemn assurance). The reason of the present assertion is the proof that it thus supplies of their dearness to him. "Ye are my friends." He had told them all that they could <span class="accented">bear</span>. He had lifted the veil high enough for their truest joy and noblest discipline. He had bared his heart to them. He had kept back nothing that was profitable. He had proved his own friendship, and thus given a conclusive reason for his complete self-devotion on their account. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a></div><div class="verse">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <i>that</i> your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - From the thirteenth to the fifteenth verse, our Lord, in a brief digression, has justified a portion of the great commandment of mutual love. That love is to correspond with his love to the disciples, and to explain his self-sacrifice to them; he proves to them that they are his "friends," and therefore the objects of his dying love. Then the appeal is still further clenched by showing the origin and purport of his friendship for them. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not choose me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> are middle, "you chose... I chose...  for yourselves or for myself"), <span class="cmt_word">but I chose you</span>. I selected you as individuals, not excluding thereby a gracious choice of other souls; I destined you to accomplish work dear to me and essential to my kingdom. Christ has already told them that he must "go away" from' them to the Father, and that they "cannot follow him now, but afterwards;" and he has also convinced them that, though he go away, he will "come again, and abide with them," and also that "severed" from him they can "do nothing." Consequently when he adds, <span class="cmt_word">I appointed you</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, for similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) as my apostles and representatives, to do work in my Name, there is no contradiction in his adding, <span class="cmt_word">that ye should go forth</span>, depart into the world with my message and in my Name, as I am "departing" to the Father, to rule over you from a higher and more august position. <span class="cmt_word">And bear fruit.</span> A passing reference to the imagery of the first part of the chapter, showing that their "going forth <span class="accented">or</span> away" upon this mission would not separate them from his Spirit, or divide the link without which they could bear no fruit at all. The "fruit" may here, in its issues, suggest another class of ideas. In the first case the "fruit" was the "fruit of the Spirit," but here it would seem to be the abiding consequence of the "greater works" which they would be called upon to do. This rich fruit includes all the victories they were to win over souls, and all the effects of their ministry. "Fruit" in either case is only valuable when it is utilized by the Husbandman and according to his purpose. "Fruit" is a Divine self-exhaustion of the living organism; it does no good to the branch nor to the stem; it is the sacred property of the husbandman, whether for his own joy or for fresh seed. In this case <span class="cmt_word">your fruit will abide for ever</span>, not in the branch, but in the Father's hands, <span class="cmt_word">that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my Name, he may give it you</span>. It now becomes a question whether the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> introduces a clause which is co-ordinate with the former or one logically depending on the preceding. Meyer concludes the first, viz. that the granting of prayer brings about the fruit and its continuance (so De Wette, Lucke, Stier, Godet); and Olshausen maintains the second, viz. that by going and bringing forth fruit we enter into that relation with God from which proceeds the prayer in the name of the Son which the Father will grant, thus bringing the passage into close relation with <a href="../../par/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a> and John 16:23. Hengstenberg says, "By their fruit they would show themselves to be true disciples of Christ, and to such the Father can deny nothing." But Westcott and Lange endeavor to combine both ideas. The co-ordination of the two clauses requires the inversion of their order, or the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> before the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. Moreover, the thought that Christ chose and appointed them in order that whatsoever they should ask God would give, is out of harmony with "the conditions of acceptable prayer" elsewhere insisted on; while the bearing of fruit - in both senses, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that of Christian grace and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Christian usefulness  = - completes the idea in a concrete form of abiding in Christ and having His Words abiding in them. Surely the view that the Second clause is conditioned by the First, is far from obscure, as Luthardt Says, while He virtually accepts the same interpretatio," see <a href="../../par/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>.)

This entire meditation culminates where it began. The digression comes back to the main theme Westcott regards it as the starting-point of a new theme, but our Lord did not return upon the idea of mutual love, but discusses the effect upon the world of that love to each other and to him which blended their personalities into one mystic unity. This verse shows how the new topic links itself with the previous discussion. His dying for them, thus proving his friendship for them, and all the other signs of his interest and confidence, have been set before them to this great end; for while the world is full of outrage and mutual animosities, the motive of his own entire self-manifestation is to awaken a new and higher type and model of humanity. Well may the familiar legend of St. John in the churches of Ephesus confirm this sublime truth. From this point to the end of the chapter (Ver. 27) Christ unfolded the consequences, to the unbelieving world, of the sacred union between himself and his disciples, and he discussed the reciprocal relations between his own disciples and the world, seeing that they are united with him in such a close incorporation.

The world loves its priests and mouthpieces, its own organization ("Caiaphas, Pilate, Herod, and Judas, and all devils," Luther); the world loves its own offspring. <span class="cmt_word">But because ye are not of the world, but I chose</span> you, withdrawing you for my service, <span class="cmt_word">out of the world</span> (the two meanings of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> here differ; the first <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> denotes origin, the second corresponds with the compound <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">therefore the world hateth you.</span> I have caused you to break with it, and you are no longer "its own." Just in proportion as you are one with me, you draw upon yourself its hatred of me. "The offence of the cross" is not ceased. Thoma comments on the harmony between this statement and that of the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse, whose colors and features are here, as he thinks, drawn upon. It is profoundly interesting to trace the fulfillment of the Lord's prescient words in earlier Scripture (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a></div><div class="verse">Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember the word which I spake to you</span> (see <a href="../../par/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>, but especially <a href="../../par/john/13-16.htm">John 13:16</a>, where Christ used the proverb), <span class="cmt_word">The servant is not greater than his lord.</span> In <a href="../../par/john/13-16.htm">John 13:16</a> the idea was used to enforce the spirit of humility and mutual service; it applies also here, but in another sense. The disciples are not to expect better treatment from the world than their Lord met with. If they (used of "the world 7, in its special concrete manifestations; "they" of Nazareth and Capernaum and Jerusalem correspond with the "they" of Lycaonia, Ephesus, Thessalonica, and Rome) persecuted me, they will persecute - drive away from them  - you also. The "if" is remarkably explicit; there is no doubt about it in Christ's case, and the supposition is one of definite and acknowledged fact, and the conditional sentence most positively assures them of antagonism and persecution. It is probable, though not certainly known, that these disciples all endured a living martyrdom, if not a cruel death in his cause. Then follows a sentence which has by some unwisely been supposed to be ironical, and by others to refer to another subject. <span class="cmt_word">If they</span> - others, or many, or some - <span class="cmt_word">kept</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "observed," "obeyed," not as Bengel supposed, "laid in wait," or "kept maliciously") <span class="cmt_word">my word, they will keep yours also</span> Why should irony be interpolated here? Surely the whole con[act with the world was not an utter failure. Christ did win persons from all classes, and they loved him, with a passionate love; and so the apostles, and all who "go forth to bear fruit," may hope for some victories, and will travail in birth with the souls of men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-21.htm">John 15:21</a></div><div class="verse">But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But all these things will they do unto you</span>. By way of consolation, he added, in view of the antagonism which the world would deliberately pursue towards them, <span class="cmt_word">For my Name's sake</span>. Many suppose that the consolatory element is emphasized in this clause. However, the idea contained in the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> has been already expressed in the previous verses, and the whole of the verse so far merely gathers it up for a new and suggestive explanation. For the Name of Christ these disciples will not only pray, labor, suffer, and die, but in the power of it they will transmute their sorrows into raptures, their tribulations into glory. <span class="cmt_word">Because they know not him that sent me.</span> If they had known the heart and nature of the Sender, they would have understood the mission of the Savior, and would neither have hated him nor his representations. (Here Lucke, Hengstenberg, Luthardt, and Lange are preferable to Meyer and Godet.) It is utter grief to Jesus that the world has been ignorant of the Father. This ignorance explains its antagonism to the representatives of Christ, and is the most appalling witness to its own depravation. No fact is more patent in the entire history of human thoughts about God than this, that "the world by wisdom knows him not," nay, it travesties his Name, misrepresents his character, distrusts, fears, and flees from the face of God. It was left to Christ to reveal the Father. In many different mental tendencies even Christendom has obscured or denied the Fatherhood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a></div><div class="verse">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I had not come,</span> as the incarnate Word of God, if I had not fulfilled the promises and come forth from God into the world to reveal the Father, <span class="cmt_word">and spoken to them</span>, made known to them the thought and Spirit of God, made it possible for them to know the essence of the only true God, <span class="cmt_word">they had had</span> <span class="cmt_word">no sin</span>; they would not have resisted the highest love, their alienation in this respect would not have been a violation of the most solemn and gracious demands of the Father. The greatest sin is the refusal of the most complete revelation, and by the side of this all other sin becomes comparatively trivial. Our Lord could not have spoken of the hatred of himself or his disciples (so Lucke and Meyer) as this sin, because it would have been obviously impossible to hate a non-existent revelation or revealer. It is the deeper fall which is consequent upon a deliberate rejection of the highest love. Formerly, they would have been in the condition of those whose sins of ignorance God overlooks (<a href="../../par/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>), and to whose <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in the past God has exercised <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in anticipation of the coming grace. <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (Luke in numerous places uses this expression to form a strong contrast) <span class="cmt_word">they have no excuse</span> or pretext <span class="cmt_word">for their sin</span>, or concerning their sin. They can plead no justification. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and is not "cloak or covering," but "<span class="accented">palliation</span> or excuse" for manifest sin. So long as men have seen no deeper into the nature of God than they can go with the aid of mere phenomena or ratiocination on the details of creation, their fears and even their hatreds formulated into grim legend, or uncouth idols, or repellent hypothesis, are a natural outcome of a nature so corrupt; but they ought to have found in Christ a deeper revelation, a summons to service and adoring love. In rejecting the idea of God which I have set before them they have no excuse. St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>) declares that those who have defamed the great characteristic of God which may be learned from nature are without excuse. Certainly our Lord does not say this here. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/15-23.htm">John 15:23</a></div><div class="verse">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth me,</span> and by implication will hate you, <span class="cmt_word">hateth my Father also</span>. The hatred of goodness in me, the refusal to accept my representation of their Father and mine, becomes a distinct hatred of God himself as I have revealed him. A God of war, a God of partisan jealousy for the honor of Israel, a God who would palliate fratricidal feud, and overlook blasphemous indifference to his true character, they might have tolerated; but the Father-God, whom they might have heard and seen in Christ, is hated by them.

They are works of the Son of God, works of creation and of healing, triumphant conflict with the forces of nature and the malice of the devil, of a kind which may be compared with, but which exceed all human and angelic ministry. <span class="cmt_word">They had not had sin, but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> The works as well as the words of Christ might have softened their hearts, but the Divine claims, which were thus pressed home upon the conscience, provoked their malice. "They took counsel to kill him;" "They took up stones to stone him." They hated God as God, and goodness and truth just because they were goodness and truth. The awful condemnation is here pronounced, "that men loved darkness rather than light." They positively saw their Father, and hated him. This is the most terrible condemnation that can be pronounced on moral beings.

Other passages may, from their similarity, have been in Christ's mind, as receiving fulfillment or abundant illustration in their conduct. The use of the expression, "the Law," has been pressed by many as proof that the writer of this Gospel did not regard himself as a Jew at all. Such numerous indications occur of the opposite conclusion, that this expression must receive the more rational interpretation - the Law in which they pride themselves, the Law which is ever in their mouths, the Law which itself contains the portraiture of their spirit: <span class="cmt_word">They hated me gratuitously</span>; <span class="accented">causelessly</span>. The true Christ was, when he came, the object of reason-less, causeless hate and opposition. Jesus knew, when he claimed to be the Christ, that he would have to complete and fulfill the solemn portraiture of the suffering, burden-bearing, and rejected Christ, as well as that of the triumphant Christ and King.

This is the great text on which the Western Church and the Greeks have alike relied for their doctrine concerning the "procession of the Spirit," the timeless, pre-mundane relations among the Personalities of the Godhead. The expression <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> only occurs in this place, and from it <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> became the ecclesiastical term for the relation which the Holy Spirit sustains to the Father, just as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was the especial term to denote the peculiarity of the Son, and just as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the condition of unbegottenness and paternity was that used to denote the Father's own hypostatic distinction. The Holy Spirit is ever proceeding, issuing forth from, sent by the Father on his work of Divine self-manifestation and Divine activity in the universe. Of this there can be no question, and the Nicene symbol originally expressed it without amplification, and the Greeks founded upon it their conception of the Trinity. The relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father were believed to be co-ordinate; and, though both were of the same eternal substance, yet both were equal to the Father. But the Western Church in after-years - notwithstanding the tremendous anathemas against all alteration which guarded the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulae - felt that the whole truth concerning the Divinity of the Son was concealed, if the idea was not also conveyed which our Lord utters side by side with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse. Christ says, "I will send him <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>," and this must be compared with (<a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>), "whom the Father will send in my Name;" and the Latins, to express this thought, added <span class="accented">filioque</span> to the phrase, "proceeding from the Father," and claimed our Lord as equally the Source of the Divine Spirit with the Father, so that it runs, "proceeding from the Father and the Son." In the endless discussions that arose, the two Churches probably meant to effect the same thing, viz. to affirm the glory and perfect Deity of the Lord Christ. The Greeks, in ancient times, never limited their statement to proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">only</span>;" nor did they object to add, "through or by the Son;" but it is probable that Augustine and the Western Church, and the liturgical forms that arose in it, approach a little more closely to the reality and quality of him who said, "I and my Father are one" in this respect, that the Spirit proceedeth from the Father and Son, when he comes into human hearts and testifies of Christ. There are those (Beza, Luthardt, Alford, Meyer) who urge that these passages do not bear at all upon the internal relations of the Godhead, but simply refer to the temporal mission of the Holy Spirit. "The words," says Luthardt, "must be understood historically, not metaphysically," and much may be said in favor of this view. If this verse does not furnish the basis of an argument, there is no other which can be advanced to establish the view either of the Eastern or Western Church. The witness of the Paraclete is said here to cover the gravest difficulties and provide the richest consolations. If the Lord intended to teach the fundamental nature of the Holy Spirit, the literal statement would be a powerful defense of the Greek doctrine; but if the passage here speaks of the official work and temporal mission, the words have no direct bearing upon that doctrine. The <span class="accented">denial</span> of the <span class="accented">filioque</span> has the logical tendency to make the Spirit and Son co-ordinate and subordinate emanations of the Father, and so to go back to the monarchianism from which the Church escaped at Nicaea. (See Pearson on the Creed, art. 8; 'Dict. Christian Biography,' art. "Holy Ghost;" Smeaten, 'Doctrine of the Holy Spirit;' Hagenbach, 'History of Christian Doctrines.') The supernatural power of the Holy Spirit will counteract the hatred in the world by regenerating individuals within it. More than that, said Christ, he (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) will bear witness to me, in the Divine strength and courage which he will give to you, in the new and corrective ideas which he will supply, in the great works seen to be mine, which you will have grace to initiate (see <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> , - passages where the "Acts of the Apostles" are seen to be "Acts of the Risen Jesus"); and <span class="accented">ye also bear witness</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. Your own experience of me from the commencement of my ministry will give you a class of testimony which will leave an indelible impression on the heart of the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Nor does the supposition that John is here the corrector of the synoptic narrative satisfy (Meyer); nor that of Godet, that Matthew, in his tenth chapter, was gathering together all that Christ had said of this nature, antedating instructions that the Lord had given, at all explain the corresponding passages in Luke's Gospel. The language of the last clause, because <span class="cmt_word">I was with you</span>, throws more light upon it. This does not surely mean "because I was bearing for you the brunt of the opposition," - it would be unnecessary altogether to say that. All along <span class="accented">they</span> must have bitterly felt the antagonism which their Lord encountered. The difficulty is removed by including in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 4 what certainly is involved in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 1; and the reference is to the whole of his instructions touching his departure and the coming of the other Paraclete, and the principle from which the hatred of the world would spring; the explanation of the anticipated hostility which he had now offered, and the way in which they might overcome it. So long as he was with them they could not be made to understand the Divine riches of the consolation which was now so near. From the beginning he had not given all this class of instruction, because he was with them. While at their side, it was premature to speak of the special help they would require in their bereaved condition.

Peter's question had obviously turned the whole matter back upon himself, and the way in which the Lord's departure affected his own duties and position; and the same may be said of Thomas. They had both lost sight of the "whither" in the pain and anguish of the departure. Our Lord had great difficulty in inducing them to realize the blessedness that would befall themselves from his own exaltation, and even now, after all that he had said about this great power and glory which awaited him, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Because I have spoken these things to you</span> - since all along you are taking the dark side, and looking on the anguish of my departure and desolateness of your own condition, instead of the grandeur of the new kingdom and dispensation of which you will be witnesses and organs - <span class="cmt_word">sorrow hath filled your heart</span>; the one heart which I throughout have been seeking to comfort.

The truth, then, thus solemnly asserted, because in their then frame of mind it was so utterly unpalatable and incredible notwithstanding all that he had said - the truth is, <span class="cmt_word">It is expedient for you that I go away</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span> clause simply <span class="accented">defines</span> that which is expedient, profitable to the disciples. Many commentators, holding everywhere the relic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, say, with Meyer and Lange, that "<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> marks fact considered with regard to the purposes destined to be accomplished by it." Here, however, the profitableness to the disciples is the chief and solitary thought. "For you:" here lies the gist of the mystery. They might have accepted his own assurance that, bitter as the mode of his departure must be, yet they ought, to and would rejoice because he was going to the Father. How was it possible for them to rejoice so far as they were personally concerned? He answers the question, <span class="cmt_word">For if I go not away</span> - and surely this solemn departure meant, as he had recently told them, by the way of death and glorification  - <span class="cmt_word">the Paraclete</span>, of whom I have spoken, the Spirit of truth (see <a href="../../par/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26, 27</a>), will not come to you; but if I go (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span>, to my Father; observe the form of the two conditional sentences, the degree of uncertainty as to the issue, to be determined by the result), <span class="cmt_word">I will send him</span> to you (see notes on John 7:39. "The Holy Spirit," as the Divine dispensation of grace to men bringing a renewed humanity into living incorporation with its great Head, <span class="accented">was not yet</span>, <span class="accented">because Jesus was not yet glorified</span>). Jesus could not become the Divine Life-center of the human family, radiating from himself the full glory of a universal harmony, until he had been taken up, until he had been glorified in God. Unspeakably precious as many of our earthly gifts and friendships are, we do not apprehend them, nor profit by them to the full, until they are taken from us. The youth, submitted to the condition of perfect dependence on a parent's care and guidance, can scarcely ever reach the fullness of his manhood until he is thrown back upon the spirit of his father's counsel, apart from that father's presence, and brings into daily practice from a new standpoint the principles he has learned. So, without any hyperbole, nothing had ever been so wonderful and blessed to the human spirit as the fellowship which had prevailed between the Son of man and his disciples. They were with him, they sat at his feet, they watched his countenance, they experienced a continuous series of Divine surprises at his judgments and his mercies. They were walking by sight, as the children of Israel did, following the pillar of fire and cloud, and drinking of the living water; but they were nevertheless living by sight. Nevertheless, there was something more wonderful and gracious still, when, in his physical absence, they would have the sense of his spiritual presence. They would lose him as an earthly Friend, but they would regain him as a Divine Reality; they would discover more than his humanity in his God-Manhood. They would wield his Divine Word as their weapon, and would become the channels of his healing and convincing and judging powers. The promise, "I will send <span class="accented">him</span>," is the guarantee of something more than a "Christ after the flesh" could ever be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he, when he is come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>).

This conviction may in some cases lead to conversion and deliverance, but is distinct from it, and sometimes also may issue after such a manifestation in hardness and impenitence. The patristic interpretation (Authorized Version and Hengstenberg), "He will reprove," might pass as a fair translation of the word, in its reference <span class="accented">to sin</span>, but would have small meaning as applied to <span class="accented">righteousness</span> or <span class="accented">judgment</span>. Meyer, Godet, Luthardt, Lange, Westcott, Stier, and Moulton agree that <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> means more than "reprove," less than "convince." The world is spoken of, not Jews merely, or their leaders. Humanity itself, with its false standards of judgment, and its self-complacency, is to be convicted of being in the wrong; all kings, princes, potentates, priests, and publicans, who are out of harmony with God, wilt be convicted by the Paraclete. The conviction of the world is threefold - <span class="cmt_word">in respect of sin, in respect of righteousness, and in respect of judgment.</span> The three great categories of thought, custom, and conduct; the three themes where the world is in infinite need of being compelled to see that it is altogether in the wrong. The disciples are to overcome the whole world by the intensity with which they will be instrumentally the occasion of this conviction. The world under the depressing and distracting influence of its own principles, as well as its passions, has misconceived the whole nature of "sin," the entire mystery of "<span class="accented">righteousness</span>," the certainty of retribution, and the things and principles on which condign "judgment" must fall. The Advocate, the Divine, indwelling Spirit of the truth, whom Christ will send into his disciples as compensation for his own absence, will through them do this strange and tremendous work. Our Lord does not here promise the conversion of mankind, but such a conviction that the blessed consequence may follow. The first great step will be taken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-9.htm">John 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">Of sin, because they believe not on me;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The three elements of this conviction of the world are separately treated. <span class="cmt_word">In respect of sin, because they believe not on me</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, has been restricted by Meyer to "so far <span class="accented">as</span>," as though the conviction with respect to sin was limited to a charge of specific unbelief; and Hengstenberg would render it "<span class="accented">consisting</span> in this, that," etc. But surely the full causal force of the particle is to be pressed, "<span class="accented">because</span> they believe not on <span class="accented">me</span>." The essence of all sin is unbelief, a refusal to surrender heart and will to the Divine will and authority, though the world generally had taken different views of it: supposing "<span class="accented">sin"</span> to be disobedience to some particular class of duties, or the neglect of certain specific ceremonial. Christ declares that the Spirit which has always been striving with men to bring them into reconciliation with God, will now convict the world that its sinful tendencies and principles have reached their highest and most willful expression in unbelief <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>, towards me. The most complete manifestation of God has received from the world the most utter and insensate repudiation. The very nature of sin thus stands revealed, the leprosy of sin will come out on the smiling self-complacency of the world. It will no longer be able to charge upon Adam, nor the devil, nor upon natures nor upon temptations of the flesh, the blame of sin; but will take the guilt home, and see that, in this crowning act of human folly, unbelievers have rendered themselves personally liable to condemnation, and, by rejecting infinite love as well as eternal law, have left themselves without excuse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-10.htm">John 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In respect of righteousness, because I go to the Father,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ye behold me no more</span>. Not merely that the world will be led to form a new conception of righteousness, seeing that God has exalted him whom they have condemned as a malefactor, - that would really, with Lucke and Meyer, limit this "righteousness" to a judgment concerning the guiltlessness of Christ; nor can we, with Luther, etc., regard it as equivalent to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> of <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, the righteous attribute and righteous process by which God is able to treat as righteous those who believe. This is the only place in the Gospel where the word occurs, and it can scarcely bear the technical significance of the great theological discussions with which it was afterwards associated. Schaff has called attention to the Vulgate translation <span class="accented">justitia</span>, which is represented in the Rheims English Version by "justice," and reminds us how Archdeacon Hare urges that "righteousness" and "justice" correspond to the entire theology of the Protestant and Romanist Churches. The Protestant sees in "righteousness" an ideal never reached by the human will in its own strength; the Romanist, by the term "justice," embodies itself in outward acts. The idea of righteousness involves the demand for purity; the idea of justice, one for cleanness. But seeing that Christ had all along called urgent attention to the fact that <span class="accented">that</span> which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God, and that the righteousness of his kingdom must exceed "the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees," it becomes clear that his exaltation to the right hand of the Father would exhibit God's ideal of righteousness; and by the aid of the Holy Spirit working through the word of the apostles, the world's view of these things would be utterly subverted, the world would be silenced, convicted of being utterly in the wrong in its idea of righteousness as well as in its judgment upon the nature of sin. The idea of righteousness will be expanded and transfigured; the idea of sin will be deepened and intensified and brought home. Stier has, with great eloquence and power, pressed the other view, which makes the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Holy Ghost nothing short of this - that there is no other righteousness for men than the righteousness of God in Christ and the righteousness of Christ before God. Notice, nevertheless, the occasions on which the world was brought to recognize the triumph of Christ's righteousness and confusion of its own prejudices (<a href="../../par/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>).

The glorification of the Son of man, to the extent of his being declared to be the Son of God with power, will be the grand event which human nature will be powerless to counteract or ultimately to resist. "Know assuredly that this same Jesus whom you have crucified is both Lord and Christ." The judgment of the prince of this world is also a fact lying outside the politics of the world, which may fume and rage as it will; it is beyond the reach of the philosophy or literature, the courts or armies, the fashions or the force, of this world. The central prince and spirit of the world is judged by the Lord Jesus, and condemned; and the time is coming when the old standard of judgment will be cast out, and the world will be compelled to admit that it has been vanquished (<a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>). The conviction concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment, by the aid of the Advocate whom Christ will send, will become the great work of the apostles and of the Church, until he comes again in his glory. While commenting upon this sublime assurance the awful process must not be forgotten, nor the fact that the prince of the world dies hard. The atrocious wickedness which burst out after the exaltation of Christ among the people who had rejected their Lord, and the consummation of the mystery of iniquity in the Roman empire, was a part of the providential conviction of the world. Archdeacon Hare, in his ' Mission of the Comforter,' insists that the entire conviction of judgment, righteousness, and sin must be the work of "the Comforter;" that all the objective facts, all the teaching of example, all the thunder of prophecy, nay, all the outward demonstration of sin, righteousness, and judgment, made in and by the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ, must be complemented by the grace of the Holy Spirit on individuals, nations, and humanity at large; and that it is in the capacity of human "Comforter," or "Advocate," that this conviction is wrought.

They could not in their present condition, and before the great events should have happened - events on which so much revealing fact would turn - bear the revelation of these "many things." Pentecost will enable them to appreciate the full mystery of love. The word used for "bear" is that which is used (<a href="../../par/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>) to describe the bearing of the cross by Christ himself. Some have found in these "many things" new articles of doctrine which have been preserved by tradition; and others, a development of truths already presented in germ; and others, again, much of the future order of the world and the Church, such as gradually evolved itself to the vision and insight and spiritual wisdom of apostolic men.

As Godet says, "The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> suits <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> better than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>." A most glorious promise this, for as days of darkness and perplexity draw on, fresh needs will arise. The "many things" which would thus be said must be presumed to have been said on highest authority; and hence the unapproachable dignity of the apostles themselves; hence the secret of all their binding and loosing power; hence the revelations they have been able to supply with reference to Christ and salvation, glory, duty, and eternal life, and all the laws of the kingdom. From this vast promise we see the sufficiency of the apostolic teaching, and by implication the portion of it which is committed to writing. Our Lord had delivered to his disciples "nothing but the truth;" but from the nature of the case they must wait for the truth in its completeness, the whole truth of salvation and deliverance. But our Lord proceeds to show that the infallibility of the Holy Spirit is not that he will be a secondary, or tertiary, or independent Divinity. Like Christ, the Son of God, who was in the bosom of the Father (see <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>), so he who proceedeth from the <span class="cmt_word">Father will not speak from himself</span>, as from any spontaneous, independent source. He is, in his gracious operations, no rival Deity, but the Spirit of the Father and the Son (comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, where the essence of the lie is that the devil speaketh of his own), <span class="cmt_word">and whatsoever things he shall hear</span> (or, <span class="accented">heareth</span>, or, <span class="accented">shall have heard</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that shall he speak</span>. The verb "hear" is used absolutely, and has been variously completed with the words, "of me" or "of the Father," whether verbally supplemented or not. We learn that the Holy Spirit is limited by the revelation already involved in the great fact of the Incarnation. "He will speak" of that which he hears, <span class="cmt_word">and he will declare to you the things that are coming</span>. The revelation will concern Christ and the future. The whole New Testament, so far as it is apostolic, is here declared to be the work inspired by the Spirit's guidance of the apostles' mind into the truth in all its completeness and in all its parts. Some, like Westcott, refer the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> to "the constitution of the Christian Church;" but the most satisfactory view is that the Spirit would himself be the Source of the prophetic hope and wondrous vision of the future which pervades the apostolic writings. Hengstenberg runs here into great detail. His remark is of deep interest - that such a promise should be found in the Fourth Gospel, preluding those sublime premonitions which the beloved disciple, when "in the Spirit," received and recorded concerning the things which are and are to come (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>). Not only in the writings of John, but of Peter, and in the prophetic spirit given to Paul, we see how the Lord the Spirit fulfilled the promise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-14.htm">John 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <i>it</i> unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall glorify me</span>. Christ has spoken of being straightway glorified, lifted into the fullness of the Godhead, glorified in God himself (<a href="../../par/john/13-32.htm">John 13:32</a>). This statement is partly explanatory of that, but is also an addition to the previous assurance. The Spirit will glorify the God-Man, will augment the luster of his blessed Name, will crown him with honor, and multiply the mirrors of his majesty and the subjects of his power; and the reason is given: <span class="cmt_word">For he shall take of mine, and</span> (for the second time, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">declare it to you</span>. Christ is here profoundly conscious of the abundance of truth and reality involved in himself and in his functions, in the work he is doing and will continue to do. He is mournfully alive to the fact that the disciples were not able to perceive what there was in him without supernatural aid. The Spirit of God will augment Christ's glory in the Church, seeing that he will reveal to men the Person and glory of the Christ, by inward processes, by vivid spiritual intuitions, by mental exercises which we are quite ready to confess are far beyond the compass of logic, and break through all laws of induction or evolution. This is the high function of the Spirit in inspiration - to take of that which belongs to the Son of God, and so to quicken the spiritual faculty of men that they can and do understand it. "The Spirit searcheth all things, even the depths of Deity," and reveals them to those who receive the Holy Ghost. Our Lord declares that all truth is implicitly contained in himself. In <a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14</a>. he said, "I am the Truth" about God and about man, and about the relation of man to God. The Spirit will draw aside the veils which hide this truth, will draw forth the hidden harmonies contained in this wondrous Personality. Such continuous revelation is from glory to glory (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17, 18</a>). St. Paul at the close of his ministry was aware of unfathomed treasures still hidden in the Christ, and he put before himself, as the goal of his highest ambition, "that I may know him" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a></div><div class="verse">All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew <i>it</i> unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - In this verse our Lord makes a still more superlative claim. <span class="cmt_word">All things which the Father hath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">are mine</span>. Perhaps no sentence recorded by St. John is more difficult to reconcile with the mere humanity of our Lord, even of the loftiest kind. The "mine" of the previous verse is declared to embrace something more than the mystery of his Person and sacrifice. "All that the Father hath," all his fullness of being, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, all the power, all the effulgence of the glory of the Father, of the human race, and of all things, "are mine." This makes a spiritual apprehension of Christ include a perfect revelation of all the Father's character and work. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said</span> <span class="cmt_word">I, that he</span> (the Spirit of truth, in being your Guide into all the truth) <span class="cmt_word">taketh of mine, and will declare</span> (it) <span class="cmt_word">unto you</span>. Because "mine is the Father's, and the Father's is mine;" because, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he is the Center, and Agent, and Motive, and Force in all the Divine self-revelation, and because he possessed as his own this vast range, this infinite fullness of Divine operations, he promised them this spiritual teaching, and assured them that his highest glory was simply to be made known as he is. Calvin, "We see how the greater part of men deceive themselves; for they pass by Christ, and go out of the way to seek God by circuitous paths." In these verses we have a very abundant exhibition of the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, coupled with a very remarkable setting forth of the tri-personality. The Father "hath" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) that which is in very. essence the Son's (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); and the Spirit, whose purpose is to glorify the Son by making him known to men (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), takes of "mine" and will declare it (see Stier, Schaff, note to Lange). Luthardt once thought with Stier, but now limits the reference, without giving any reason for it, to what he calls "the deposit of Divine truth in the humanity of Jesus." The sum of this astonishing assurance is that the Holy Spirit of truth, an essential element if not Personality in the Godhead, will lead these apostles into the fullness of truth, and of knowledge of the future, by taking up the essential realities of the Christ in the fullness of his being and work, and disclosing them by spiritual insight and supernatural quickening. These realities of the Christ will prove to be the fullness of the Father's heart - all that the Father hath. Again we ask - Does St. John even here travel beyond his prologue? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16</a></div><div class="verse">A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-24.</span> - (c) The <span class="accented">sorrow turned into joy</span>. In these verses he approaches the final farewell, in which the whole body of the disciples are introduced as inwardly or among themselves perturbed by the special difficulty of the words. Before the Spirit can do all this, a separation must be experienced. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A little while</span>. A phrase repeated seven times in this brief passage, emphatically encouraging his own disciples to rise above the limitations of time, and enjoy the habits of eternity. <span class="cmt_word">Ye behold me no more.</span> The first puzzle of this utterance lies in this - that (<a href="../../par/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>) he had told them that, though the world would see him no more, they would behold him in the power of the Spirit, and that they would moreover have adequate preparation for such spiritual beholding in the resurrection; yet now he says, "Ye behold me no more." True, he has associated this phrase already, in Ver. 10, with the conviction of the world touching true righteousness and his "going to the Father," so that henceforth he would be hidden in God; but now he increases the perplexity by adding, <span class="cmt_word">And again, a little while, and ye shall see me.</span> The commentators differ greatly as to the reference, but (with Hengstenberg, Weiss, Stier, Westcott, Ebrard, Ewald) the most obvious explanation is that he is referring to the resurrection, which in itself would be in part a glorification of Christ, and which, from its entire method of manifestation to them, would prove a preparation for the spiritual sense of his continual presence. This was perfected at Pentecost, and will be completed when he shall come again in his glory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-17.htm">John 16:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then said <i>some</i> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said</span> (some) <span class="cmt_word">of his disciples one to another, not daring to utter it to him, What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye behold me not: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span> This clause now aggravates their difficulty, whether they associate it with the idea already uttered, or whether they repeat the Lord's word (g-r, may be simply the "that" of quotation). The program of the future - e.g. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> death and momentary absence, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> resurrection and transitory presence, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> departure to the Father and abiding presence <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>form a group of ideas very difficult even for us now to realize or "to <span class="accented">know"</span> fully what he saith.

He had often said this, and they refused to understand. It was not merely a resurrection of the body, but the glorification in the Father of his entire Personality, for which he wished them to be prepared. A simple restoration like that of Lazarus would not have secured him from the malice of those who sought to put Lazarus also to death. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that weep and lament you shall, and the world shall rejoice</span>. Here is his own account of the effect upon them of that he said, "A little while," and you <span class="accented">will behold</span> me, as you think, <span class="accented">no more</span>. The world will rejoice, because to some extent it will be the world's doing, and it will fancy for a little while that it has got its way and succeeded excellently well The world will roll a stone to his sepulcher, and make it as sure as they can, sealing the stone and setting a watch. Pharisaism will exult that this demand for a higher righteousness than its own is for ever hushed; Sadduceeism will rejoice that this troublesome witness to unseen and eternal things is silenced; the hierarchy will boast that now no danger prevails of the Romans taking away their place and nation; the world will praise the deed of blood; but all this rejoicing will last "a little while." Christ reaffirms their grief, and even for "a little while" justifies it, so long as they can hear the <span class="accented">jubilate</span> of the world over their personal burden of unutterable sorrow. He continues: <span class="cmt_word">You shall be sorrowful, but in a little while your sorrow shall be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36</a>) <span class="cmt_word">turned into joy</span>. Clearly because "you shall see me." It cannot be said that our Lord here positively asserts his resurrection; but when we remember how "the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord," how Mary ran "with great joy to bring his disciples word," we feel that here was the simple solution of the mystery, and that our Lord's intercourse with them in his resurrection-body was the great prelibation of the method of his continuous abiding with them in the power of his Spirit and the glorification of his body - we cannot doubt that this was his meaning and the purpose of the evangelist in recording it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The next illustration is very remarkable, and surely cannot be a simple analogy of the supervening of joy on sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">The woman</span> (the article does not point to any special <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, but refers to a universal fact and law of womanhood, cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>) <span class="cmt_word">when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come.</span> So now there are the travail-pangs of the new humanity, the new theocracy, bitter and terrible, <span class="cmt_word">But as soon as she has brought forth the child, she remembereth no longer the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.</span> The old prophets often compared the grief of Israel or her peril to the pangs of a travailing woman preluding deliverance (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-6.htm">Isaiah 66:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>) and even joy - the joy of bringing manhood into the world and the new consciousness of maternity. Meyer and others rebel against any meaning beyond that of the following of joy upon sorrow; but Tholuck, De Wette, Ebrard, and Moulton see here the obvious reference to those "travail-pangs of death" with which St. Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>) said that the Holy One could not be restrained, agonies in which for a while every apostle must have wept and lamented, dying and being crucified with him, and to the glorious deliverance of all who suffered with him, when they live again in newness of life by the power of his resurrection.

The point of the vision is his own consciousness of their human need filling all the forty days with its glory. The occasional manifestations of his Person during that interval helped them in a wonderful way to recognize the fact that he was ever watching them, and was at their side under all the circumstances of human life. <span class="cmt_word">And your heart shall rejoice, and this joy of yours no one taketh</span> (present in the full sense of a realized future) from you.

That conviction was forced upon them before Pentecost (see <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>, and the account in this Gospel of the spiration and communication of the Holy Ghost, <a href="../../par/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>), before he came as the sound of a rushing mighty wind, or sat in tongues of flame on their heads. Your joy in the sense of my constant presence no one, neither man nor devil, taketh away from you.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> is omitted by modern editors. <span class="cmt_word">The hour cometh</span> - the great climacteric period of my revelation - <span class="cmt_word">when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs</span>, when, indeed, the sound of my voice will be hushed, and words will no longer be needed, when Divine spirations and heavenly pulsations shall convey to you what my parabolic teaching and my paroimic interpretations have failed to impart, when I shall be with you and in you, and by the energy of the Paraclete <span class="cmt_word">I shall declare</span> (<span class="cmt_word">to you</span>) <span class="cmt_word">plainly</span>, with clearness and openness, in the fullness of spiritual light, without reserve, circumlocution, or parable, <span class="cmt_word">concerning the Father</span>. This promise declares that the glorious revelations of Pentecost and the teaching of those who received the Holy Ghost will be verily and indeed our Lord Christ's own most personal and frank and outspoken revelations of the Father; 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-26.htm">John 16:26</a></div><div class="verse">At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span> - pointing to "the hour" of these open declarations - <span class="cmt_word">ye shall ask</span> (<span class="accented">make petitions</span>, not ask or demand of me, in the tone of equality) <span class="cmt_word">in my Name</span>. The opportunity will come when all my Name will be appreciated by you, and your spiritual reception of me will teach you to approach the Father, who is thus revealed to you. Calvin in these verses calls attention to the familiarity of Israel with the idea of a Mediator, one by whom they drew near to God, and that Christ places himself here in the stead of the whole propitiatory service and ritual of the temple. "His Name" was the Divine equivalent of all the work of the high priest from one Day of Atonement to another and for evermore. <span class="cmt_word">And I do not say to you, that I will make my request to the Father concerning you</span> (see note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, Ver. 23, etc.). It will not do to argue, with Grotius, that this is just as if he had said, "To say nothing of my own intercessions for you," or, "You may take these for granted;" because the very next verse gives his reason for the assertion. Nor is it satisfactory to say, with Meyer, that the "prayers" of which he speaks (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9, 20</a>) are <span class="accented">before</span> the gift of the Paraclete, and not inconsistent with the higher condition of the disciples after the Paraclete should have been given; because John had received the Paraclete when he wrote, "We have an Advocate with the Father" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). Nor can we suppose that the great utterances of <a href="../../par/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-25.htm">Hebrews 9:25</a> are vain imaginations, and that there is no sense in which the Lord does augment and complete our prayers, taking them upon his heart and going in his high-priestly prerogative into the holy place with his own blood; but the words must nevertheless be pressed, and their meaning held to be compatible with what Paul and John say of the" intercession of Christ." They reveal the perfect access to the Father's heart which he has secured for his disciples, the full reconciliation effected as well as devised and consummated by the Father's own love (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>, "By Christ we both [Jew and Gentile] have access (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) in one <span class="accented">spirit to the Father"</span>). The end of the whole ministry of Christ is, in the power of the Holy Ghost's revelation of him, to bring men to the Father and let them know it. There is no need that Christ should (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) make special prayer to the Father, as though he were merciful and the Father needed to be appeased towards those for whom he had prepared so great a salvation (see <a href="../../par/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>, where Philippi, Calvin, and others show that Christ's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is the effect of his own glorious and eternal work). His appearance in the presence of God for us is the perpetual pledge of the completeness of his sacrifice. These very passages in Hebrews and Romans have to be interpreted in harmony with this great statement of his own, viz. that there is no reason to ask the Father concerning them; all has been asked and answered, the intercession is complete; his whole work will have reconciled the Father with his children, and that by reason of the Father's own love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a></div><div class="verse">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Father himself loveth you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), with love of a fatherly affection, such as mine to you, <span class="cmt_word">because ye have loved me</span> (the perfect preterit, in the sense of the realized past in the present which shall then be), and have believed that I came forth from <span class="accented">the side of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Father</span>. In their belief of this transcendent fact is the hope of the world. It was wrought in them by the strengthening pulses of a deepening love, and to this love God himself responds with a personal tender affection that encourages boundless prayer. The disciple and lover of Jesus, having Jesus in the heart, united to him by living faith, will find in Christ that there is a perpetual pledge of reciprocal love between the Father and himself. Christ will not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) ask the Father, because his entire position as Mediator establishes a continual appeal, is a perpetual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a continuous drawing near and appeal to God on our account, a pledge and guarantee of our own fellowship with and access to the Father. Our English word "intercession," though apparently corresponding with the Latin and with the Greek word, does not now represent its original meaning. That meaning is by no means equivalent to the hind of prayer which is here excluded (Trench, 'Syn. N.T.,' &sect; 51.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a></div><div class="verse">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - In these words our Lord gathers sublimely up a record of his entire self-manifestation. <span class="cmt_word">I came forth out of the Father</span> (where <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, is the new and better reading), as from the Divine Source of my pre-existent glory, <span class="cmt_word">I have come into the world</span>, incarnate in humanity, "the Word was made flesh," "the Light lighting every man has come into the world." <span class="cmt_word">Again, I am leaving the world</span> behind me, though for a little while you may behold me, <span class="cmt_word">and I am going</span> on a great mission, with a goal in view, <span class="cmt_word">to the Father</span>. "Recapitulationem maximam habet hic versus" (Bengel). Christ had said all this before, but they have never seen it as a whole. The several parts had been so impressive, that the whole truth had been concealed from them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-29.htm">John 16:29</a></div><div class="verse">His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His disciples say to him, Behold, even now thou speakest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">thy utterance is with plainness</span> and clearness, <span class="cmt_word">and speakest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">no proverb</span>. The promise made so recently (Ver. 25) seems to them already fulfilled. Some beam of the heavenly light has begun to irradiate the whole of this sublime but partially realized revelation of God in Christ. The doubts vanish in this sunshine.

He had answered their unutterable yearning. That which stirred them very deeply on many occasions was this proof that nothing in their hearts was hidden from him. Nathanael was one of them, and now he saw "angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man." "Thou knowest all things." <span class="accented">The idea in their minds</span> does not embrace the full range of human inquiry, nor the depths of Deity, but all the things which are in their hearts to ask him.

Though Lange makes the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> equivalent to "because," yet generally John gives to the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> which follows a verb after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> the sense of "that," thus introducing the object of the verb, though in one place, <a href="../../par/1_john/4-13.htm">1 John 4:13</a>, both constructions are seen in the same sentence. The objective force of "that" is to be preferred here). We believe that thy whole ministry and message is a revelation of God, a coming near to us of the Father. Thy name is "Immanuel, God with us." A question arises whether the disciples in this gush of faith said more than they really meant, and deserved reproof, or whether they had reached an elevation of thought from which they never would absolutely recede. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-31.htm">John 16:31</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered them, Now</span>, at this stage in my self-revelation, do ye believe? It seems as though the whole of Christ's ministry turns on their acceptance of his claims. If he should pass from the world and return to the Father, and leave behind him none who had discovered and become intensely convinced of his Divine nature, the whole work he had done would be, humanly speaking, a failure. An almost womanlike passion of desire breathes through the inquiry, "Do ye now believe?" or, as some commentators (Gorier and Meyer) translate it indicatively, "Now ye believe." There is truly no essential difference whether it be taken interrogatively or indicatively. Both forms mean, "I have at length brought you to the point of faith. The kingdom of God is now established, and the prince of this world cast out. But a terrible trial awaits the new-born faith." Christ had warned them of the treachery of the absent one, of the approaching denial of the foremost of their number, and he now gives them another warning of the severity of the trial which awaited them all. The <span class="accented">power and permanence</span> of their faith may be open to doubt, but not its essential quality. Their faith may not stand firm on that awful night, but it will ultimately prevail, and Christ rejoices in the fact that his words have at last evoked this genuine response. In the prayer which follows (<a href="../../par/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>) he thanks God "that they have known verily that I came forth from thee, and have believed that thou hast sent me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the hour cometh</span>, [<span class="cmt_word">yea</span>] <span class="cmt_word">is come, that</span> (see Ver. 2.

The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> points back to <a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, and reminds us of our Lord's recent quotation of this very prophecy, and his application of it to the disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31, 32</a>). This falling away from Jesus as he rises more and more into the greatness of his work is one of the witnesses of his Divine mission into such a world as this First the Galilaean hosts and the multitudes who shouted "Hosanna!" then his own brethren, then all except the twelve, then all the authorities, are openly hostile. Even Joseph and Nicodemus and Lazarus are silent, Judas is treacherous; but the eleven still cling to him. Soon Christ selects from the faithful few the faithfullest for the watch over his last agony, but one of these denies him, and they all forsake him and flee. John and his mother, who follow within earshot of the cross, are sent to their own home, and there is a moment when he is absolutely alone. He even says, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" But as in this agony he can still say, "Father, into thy hands," so here he anticipates the Divine overshadowing presence, and adds, <span class="cmt_word">Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> The sublimest word of all, charged with consolation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a></div><div class="verse">These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.

The tone of these last triumphant words reminds them of the finest and noblest of his previous assurances, his promises of peace, courage, and victory over all the evil and power of this world) <span class="cmt_word">to you, that in me ye might have peace</span> (see note, <a href="../../par/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27, 28</a>). The entire issue of the discourse is the conference on his disciples of his own secret of <span class="accented">peace - the</span> adequate support amid the crushing force and vehement hostility of the world (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-4</a>, "Though the earth be removed.., there is a river," etc.). Peace is the balance of equilibrating forces; and man needs a Divine force behind and within him to encounter the tremendous odds arrayed against him, in mysteries of life, temptation of the devil, infirmity of the flesh, and antagonism of the world, so that we need not be surprised to hear him say, <span class="cmt_word">In the world ye have</span> <span class="cmt_word">tribulation</span>. It is the fundamental condition of Divine life in this world. Christ's disciples may take that for granted (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>), but the most striking and unique note of the true faith is that this sorrow is blended with an inward rapture which transforms it into peace. The blending of fear and love, of law with promise, of righteousness with mercy, of the sense of sin with that of pardon, of a great peace with a crushing tribulation, is one of the most constant tokens, signs, or marks of the mind of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">But be of good courage.</span> This is the practical uprising of the soul into the joy of the Lord (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 28</a>). (The word itself is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in John, though found in <a href="../../par/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x27;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">have overcome the world</span>. "A vous encore le combat, a mot des a present la victoire! Mats en mot la meme victoire a vous vous aussi" (Reuss). The royal sublimity of this last word, on the eve of the Passion, became one of the perpetually recurring thoughts of John (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2, 3</a>, where the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is again and again referred to). Christ's victory already assured to him becomes theirs. So "by similar anticipation we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a>." The victory had been, however, already achieved over the world's temptations, and over the bitterness of internal treachery, and the vast sum of human ingratitude; and this may in part explain the use of the perfect tense, "I have overcome." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/17.htm"><title>John 17 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/17.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/17.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/17-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/16.htm" title="John 16">&#9668;</a> John 17 <a href="../john/18.htm" title="John 18">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a></div><div class="verse">These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-26.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The <span class="accented">high-priestly intercession</span>. .<span class="accented">Audible communion of the Son with the Father</span>. The prayer which now follows reveals, in the loftiest and sublimest form, the Divine humanity of the Son of man, and the fact that, in the consciousness of Jesus as the veritable Christ of God, there was actually blended the union of the Divine and human, and a perfect exercise of the prerogatives of both. The illimitable task which writers of the second century must have set themselves to accomplish, if they had by some unknown process conceived such a stupendous idea without any historical basis to support it, has actually been so effected, that a representation is given which adequately conveys such a synthesis. The author of the Gospel does, however, draw rather upon his memory of that night than upon his philosophical imagination for a passage which surpasses all literature in its setting forth the identity of being and power and love in the twofold personality of the God-Man. We are brought by it to the mercy-seat, into the heaven of heavens, to the very heart of God; and we find there a presentation of the most mysterious and incomprehensible love to the human race, embodied in the Person, enshrined in the words, of the only begotten Son. It need not perplex those who believe that we have the words of Jesus, that this prayer of sublime victory and glorious promise should be followed by the agony and the bloody sweat of Gethsemane, where the glorification of the Son of man passed into the advanced stage of his willing and perfect surrender to the Supreme Will. Hengstenberg finds explanation of John's silence touching that agony in the supplemental character of the Gospel, which does not repeat a description of a scene already familiar to all readers of the synoptic narrative. This may account for the mere form of the record, but does it meet the perplexity that arises as to whether the scene of Gethsemane could possibly follow John's narrative? Is not such a conception incompatible altogether with the cry, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me"? Our answer is a reference to <a href="../../par/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>, where there is the exact counterpart of the scene in the garden. Nor is a mysterious troubling of the Redeemer's soul elsewhere absent from the Johannine narrative. At the grave of Lazarus, as well as when the Greeks wrung from his lips the cry, "Father, save me from this hour," followed by "Father, glorify thy Name," we have the blending of an utterly indescribable affliction with a triumphant acceptance by him of the Divine purpose of his mission and the will of his Father. Throughout these discourses he is meditating his departure with all its accompanying grief and agony. He describes the way he is about to take as one which would be like the travail-pang of a new humanity; but in his capacity of living in the light of the Father's will, he treats the whole mystery of the cross, the grave, the resurrection, the ascension, as already achieved. Throughout this prayer he regards the work as finished, and the new order of things as already existent. Thus he had prayed for Lazarus and for his restoration from the grave, and he knew then that God heard him; but still he wept, and, groaning within himself, came to the sepulcher. It should also be remembered that (<a href="../../par/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>) he had expressly said that he was then about to encounter the prince of this world. The perfect humanity of Jesus, on which John continually insists, does entirely justify the rapid changes of mood and the vehemence of the emotions which were in their conflict issuing in sublime courage and perfect peace. The school of Renan, Strauss, and others, following the lead of Bret-schneider, see insuperable difficulties, because they have an idea of Christ's Person which would render it inconceivable and incredible (see Introduction, p. 106.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">With reference to himself</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus spake these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the discourse which precedes, and then turned from his disciples to the Father. The place where the prayer was offered is comparatively unimportant, yet it must have been uttered somewhere. It has been well suggested that the Lord, with the disciples, sought the comparative quiet of the Father's house, and in some of the courts of the temple, within sight of the golden gate with its mighty <span class="accented">vine</span>, had enacted all that is recorded in <a href="../../par/john/15.htm">John 15-17</a>. This does not interfere with the idea that the starry sky was visible to them, and that from some portion of the temple-courts our Lord should have lifted his eyes to heaven; for the heavens are the perpetual symbol of the majesty of God, and show that side on which, by instinctive recognition of the fact, men may and do look out upon the infinite and the eternal. <span class="cmt_word">And having</span> <span class="cmt_word">lifted up his eyes to heaven</span> - or, <span class="accented">lifting</span> (Revised Version) <span class="accented">up his eyes to heaven - <span class="cmt_word"></span>he said</span>, in a voice which the wondering, believing, and troubled disciples might hear (see Ver. 13), and from which they were intended to learn much of the relation between their Lord and the eternal Father. There is a twofold division of the prayer: From Vers. 1-5 <span class="accented">he offers prayer for himself</span>, but in special relation to his own power over and his own grace to the children of men; from Vers. 6-19 he contemplates the special interests of his disciples, in their present forlorn condition, in their work, conflict, and ultimate triumph; from Vers. 19-26 he prays for the whole Church, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> for its unity, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> for its expansion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> its glory. For himself he has little to ask (Vers. 1-5), but as soon as his word takes the form of intercession for his own (Vers. 6-26), it becomes an irresistible stream of the most fervent love. Sentence rushes upon sentence with wonderful power, yet the repose is never disturbed (Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>; not "my Father," nor "our Father," the prayer given to his disciples, nor "my God" as afterwards upon the cross; nor was it the customary address to "God" of either Pharisee or publican; but it recalls the "Abba, Father" of the garden, which passed thence into the experience of the Church (<a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hour</span> which has so often presented itself as inevitable, but which so often has receded, and which even now delays its full realization (<a href="../../par/john/2.htm">John 2, 7, 12, 13</a>.) as part of a Divine plan concerning him, the hour of the fiery baptism, of the solemn departure, of the conflict with the prince of this world, and of complete acceptance of the Father's will, <span class="cmt_word">has come; glorify thy Son, that</span> (<span class="cmt_word">thy</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Son may</span> (<span class="cmt_word">also</span>) <span class="cmt_word">glorify thee</span>. Lift thy Son into the glory which thou hast prepared, that the Son whom thou hast sanctified and sent into the world may glorify thee. It is very noticeable that he speaks of himself in the <span class="accented">third</span> person. This is justified by the fact that he here conspicuously rises out of himself into the consciousness of God, and loses himself in the Father. The glorification of <span class="accented">the Son</span> is first of all by <span class="accented">death</span> issuing in life. He was crowned with glory in order that he might taste death for every man. The conflict, the victorious combat with death, was the beginning of his glory. In taking upon himself all the burden of human sorrow, and exhausting the poison of the sting of death, he would "glorify God" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19</a>). This does not exhaust the meaning, but the further forms and elements of his glory are referred to afterwards. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as thou gavest him authority</span>  - an indefeasible claim of influence and intimate organic relations with humanity - <span class="cmt_word">over all flesh</span>. [This phrase answers to (<span class="accented">col bosor</span>) the Old Testament term for the whole of humanity, the entire race, and is one adopted by New Testament writers (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-6.htm">Luke 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>).] This  authority was implied in his incarnation and sacrifice, and in the recapitulation of all things in him. St. Paul says, "Because he tasted death for every man, God has highly exalted him, and given him <span class="accented">the Name</span> that is above every name," etc. These opening words reveal the universality and world-wide aspects of the mission and authority and saving power of the Son of God. He holds the keys of the kingdom and city of God. The government is upon his shoulder. Through him all the nations on earth are to be blessed. But the dependence of "all flesh" upon a Divine <span class="accented">gift</span> of eternal life through him is no less conspicuous; hence the hopelessness of human nature as it is and apart from grace. The end of this glorification of the Son in the Father is <span class="cmt_word">that</span>, in the exercise of this authority, <span class="cmt_word">he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.</span> The construction is unusual, and literally rendered would be, <span class="accented">that with reference to the whole of that which thou hast given him</span>, <span class="accented">to them he should give eternal life</span>. The clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, may be a nominative or accusative absolute, which, by the defining <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> subsequently resolved into individual elements. The redeemed humanity of all time has been given to the incarnate Son, and is undoubtedly different from the (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>) "all flesh" of the previous clause, but it is further explained to mean the individual men and women who receive from him eternal life. The bestowment of eternal life on those thus given to him is the method in which he will glorify the Father (see notes on John 6:37, where the Father is said to draw men to himself by means of the unveiling of his own true character in the Son, and where this <span class="accented">drawing</span> is seen to be another way of describing the Father's <span class="accented">gift</span> to the Son). Those who are given to Christ are those who are drawn by the Father's grace to see his perfect self-revelation in the face of Jesus Christ, of whom Jesus says, "I will by no means cast them out" (<a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>), and concerning whom he avers, "No one cometh unto the Father but by me" (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">life</span> eternal, is frequently described as his gift. From the first the evangelist has regarded <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span> as the inherent and inalienable prerogative of the "Logos," and the source of all the "light" which has lighted men. This "life," which is "light," came into the world in his birth, and became the head of a new humanity. It is clearly more than, and profoundly different from, the principle of unending existence. Life is more than perpetuity of being, and eternity is not endlessness, nor is "eternal life" a mere prolongation of duration; it refers rather to state and quality than to one condition of that state; it is the negation of time rather than indefinite or infinite prolongation of time. That which Christ gives to those who believe in him, receive him, is the life of God himself. It is strongly urged by many that this eternal life is a present realizable possession, that he that hath the Son hath life, and that we are to disregard the future in the conscious enjoyment of this blessedness; but we must not forget that our Lord obviously refers the life eternal to the future in <a href="../../par/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. Nor are these statements, as some have said, incompatible with the representations of this Gospel (see <a href="../../par/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40, 54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>). The aionian blessedness may have a partial realization here and now, but not fill our vision is less clouded and our perils are less severe shall we fully apprehend it. Nor is this inconsistent with Ver. 3. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The life eternal</span>, of which Jesus has just spoken, <span class="cmt_word">is this</span> (cf. for construction, <a href="../../par/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>), <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">they might know</span> - should come to know - <span class="cmt_word">thee, the only veritable God</span>. All ideas of God which deviate from or fall short of "the Father" revealed to us by Christ, are not the veritable God, and the knowledge of them is not life eternal. The Father is here set forth as the <span class="accented">fens Deitatis</span>. This does not exclude "the Son," but is inconceivable without him. The Fatherhood expresses an eternal relation. The one element involves the ether as integral to itself: "I am in the Father, and the Father in me." There is a knowledge of the Father possible even now. "Henceforth, he has said, ye have seen him, and known him;" yet not till the veil is lifted, and we see face to face, shall we know as we are known (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), shall we see him as he is. <span class="cmt_word">And him whom thou didst send, Jesus the Christ</span> (not <span class="accented">Jesus to be</span>, or as <span class="accented">Christ</span>, but rather "Jesus the Christ," as the expansion and explanation of the more indefinite term, "him whom thou didst scud"). Why does our Lord add to this expression one that at first sight seems so incompatible with the idea of this prayer? It has led so careful and reverential a commentator as Westcott to remove the difficulty by supposing that the whole verse is a gloss of the evangelist, expressing the sense of what our Lord may have uttered at greater length. We are loath to admit this method of exegesis, especially as the sole reasons for it are the supposed strangeness of our Lord's here using a phrase so unaccustomed, and thus giving himself not only his Personal Name, but his own official title. It is unusual. The phrase does undoubtedly belong to a later period for its current and constant use. Yet it must not be forgotten <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this is a unique moment in his career, and unique expressions may be anticipated; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it was calculated to strengthen his disciples, to allow them to hear once from his own lips the solemn claim to Messiahship (see Godet); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that John himself at once adopted it as his own (<a href="../../par/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-22.htm">1 John 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1-20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 2, 5</a>); moreover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in <a href="../../par/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a> Jesus Christ is, himself lifted up into the region of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the apostle adds, "This is the true God, and eternal life" (Hengstenberg). It is from these very words that some critics imagine that the evangelist, rather than the Lord himself, framed the clause; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> yet it is quite as rational to suppose that the words uttered by Jesus dwelt like a strain of sacred music in the memory of the apostle. Moreover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the knowledge of the only true God is really conditioned by the knowledge of him who was indeed the great Revelation, Organ, and Effluence of the Father's glory. The fullness of this knowledge is the end of all Christian striving. Paul said, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus... and that I <span class="accented">may</span> know him" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). How much is there yet to know! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> Finally, as our Lord is rising more and more into the glory of an utter self-abandonment, and into the glory which he had with the Father from eternity, the human nature which he still inhabits becomes almost an appendage of his Divine Personality, and he might with awful significance, when referring to the object of human faith and knowledge, say, "Him whom thou hast sent - Jesus the Christ." Moreover, on any hypothesis of the composition or framing of an intercessory prayer for the Logos Christos to utter, there is an equal difficulty in the insertion into such prayer by St. John of this reference to himself as the Christ. The knowledge of the Father as the only true God, in opposition to the heathen traditions and philosophical speculations of the world, coupled with a corresponding knowledge of the only adequate expression of the Father's heart and nature, sent forth from him, as One promised, consecrated, and empowered to represent him, is <span class="accented">life - ere</span> <span class="accented">half life</span>.

This is, however, included in the next clause. The night has come when the earthly ministry is at an end. The Jesus Christ, whom the Father has sent, has completed his task. The whole work of the earthly manifestation of the Word was at an. end. Suffering remains, the issues of the conflict with evil have to be encountered; but the die is cast - the thing is done. The godly life, as well as the atoning death, are correlative parts of the merits and work of Christ, and have glorified the Father. But what a self-consciousness beams forth in these simple words! St. Paul, on the verge of his martyrdom, in the midst of the horrors of the Neronian persecution, exclaimed, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course." But our Lord is unconscious of any coming short of the glory of God; and he even counts on higher power to glorify God by returning to a position which he had for a while vacated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) - the very point of time has come - <span class="cmt_word">glorify thou me, O Father</span>, explaining the opening of the prayer, "Glorify thy Son." He identifies his own Personality - "me" -with that of "the Son," and "thy Son." <span class="cmt_word">With thy own self</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); in closest connection and fellowship with thy-self - a relation which has been arrested or suspended since have been "Jesus Christ," and glorifying thee amid the toil and sorrow of this earthly pilgrimage. This immediate glorification of the Son embraces the glory of vicarious death, the triumphant resurrection, the mystery of ascension in the strength of his human memories to the right hand of God (<a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31, 32</a>). He still further defines this wondrous prospect, as <span class="cmt_word">with the glory which I had with thee before the world was</span> - before the being of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> in John represents local relationships (see <a href="../../par/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-40.htm">John 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-25.htm">John 14:25</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>) or intimate spiritual associations (<a href="../../par/john/14.htm">John 14: </a>). So our Lord remembers and anticipates a "glory with the Father." That which he refers to as before the existence of the world has been softened down by Grotius, Wettstein, Schleiermacher, and some moderns to mean the glory of the Divine thought and destination concerning him; but the expression <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> far from being exhausted by such a rendering. He who wrote the prologue (<a href="../../par/john/1-2.htm">John 1:2, 18</a>) meant that, as the Logos had been  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and at a special epoch "became flesh," the beamings forth of his glory on earth were those which belonged to human life, to the form of a servant, and were profoundly different from that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in which his innermost self-consciousness, the center of his Personality, originally dwelt. And now he seeks to carry this new appanage of his Sonship, this God-glorifying humanity, up into the glory of the pre-existent majesty (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8, 13</a>). The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> which was visible to the disciples on earth (<a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) was glory limited, colored, conditioned, by human life and death; but so complete was the Lord's union with the Logos, that it did not quench his memory of the glory of his omnipresent, eternal Being, nor his remembrance of absolute coexistence with the Father before all worlds. He would lift humanity to the very throne of God by its union with his Person. This stupendous claim both as to the past and future would be utterly bewildering if it stood alone; but the Old Testament has prepared the mind of the disciples for this great mystery (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>.). The theophanies generally, and <a href="../../par/john/8-25.htm">John 8:25</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>, with numerous other passages, sustain and corroborate the conception that the Logos of God was throughout all human history on the verge of manifestation in the flesh. The record of the extraordinary God-consciousness of Jesus does transcend all human experience, and baffles us at every turn; but the human consciousness of Jesus appears gradually to have come into such communion with the Logos who had become flesh in him, that he thought the veritable thoughts and felt the emotions of the eternal God as though they were absolutely his own. In addition to this idea of his resumption of his own eternal state, Lange and Moulton, in opposition to Meyer, lay emphasis on the answer to this prayer, consisting in such a manifestation of the premundane glory <span class="accented">in his flesh</span>, that it should perfectly establish the relation between the glory of the Father before all worlds, -rod the glory of utter and complete self-sacrifice for the redemption of the world. The glory of omnipotence and omnipresence is lost in the greater glory of infinite love. Thus the glory which he had with the Father would be best seen in the completion of his agony, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the cross.

He clothes these meditations in the form of a direct address to the eternal God, and makes the series of facts on which he dwells the groundwork of the prayer which follows for his disciples, as representative of all who, like them, have come into relations with the Father through him. <span class="cmt_word">I manifested thy Name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> here corresponds to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of Ver. 4.

"I poured light upon, and thus made appreciable, apprehensible, <span class="accented">thy Name</span>." This Name was but partially and imperfectly understood before. The Name of God, the compendium of all his excellences, the essential features of his substantial Being which Christ has thus illuminated, is "the Father." "Whatsoever is made manifest is light." This light is the effulgence of the glory of the Father. By being and living on earth as Son of the Father, the Father was revealed. A full revelation of the Father involves and is involved in a manifestation of his own Sonship. The relation between the Father and the Son is one of infinite complacency and mutual affection, and the revelation of it demonstrates the fact of the eternal and essential love of the Divine Being. Thus the fact that "God is love" is manifested in the life of the Son of man, who was in himself a revelation of the Son - the Son of God. "I <span class="accented">manifested</span> thy Name," said Jesus - showing that he regarded his work of self-manifestation and God-revelation as virtually <span class="accented">complete</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">to the men whom thou gavest</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (cf. here <a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a> and John 10:29). The Father's "giving" of the sons of men to Christ refers primarily to the men that were made susceptible of his special grace and revelations, who in seeing, saw, in hearing, heard, who, being drawn by inward monitions and Divine grace, and verily taught of God, came to Christ. Thus the Father gave them to Christ. The first monitions, susceptibilities of soul for Christ, which are found throughout the world and the Church, are God's way of giving men to Christ. The supremacy and monergy of grace is involved in the whole of this representation. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the world</span>. They were in the world, but have been drawn out of it by the re-relation of the Father. <span class="cmt_word">Thine they were, and thou gavest</span> <span class="cmt_word">them me</span>. So that the approach even to the Lord Jesus, the drawing to Christ and to the blessed revelation of the Father, was preceded by a previous condition - "Thine they were." Before the process of giving and drawing was begun, there was a sense in which they bore this great designation. Their position as creatures, or as Israelites, or as believers in the Old Testament manifestation of the Name, seems to fall short of the solemn assertion, "Thine they were." There were in every case spiritual predispositions. They were "of God" (<a href="../../par/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>); "doers of the truth" (<a href="../../par/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>); "willing to do the will of God" (<a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>); they were of the truth (<a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37, 44</a>). All these expressions reveal an extraordinary relation of human souls to the Father, which is presupposed, and precedes the power over them and advantage to them of the grace of Christ. This may throw light on the work of grace in pre-Christian and non-Christian times and places. <span class="cmt_word">Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> - the sum total of thy revelation or <span class="cmt_word">Word</span> to them. They, these men, these special representative men, have been true to their light, and know of the doctrine whether it be of God. Their own quickened conscience has been strong enough to justify all my <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, my <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, as Divine assurances. To Christ's eyes they have already come out of their fiery trial faithful and true. <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, at this point in their training, <span class="cmt_word">they have known</span>, by a strong experience, by tasting, handling, seeing, trusting, by vivid flashes of light, by keen, clear intuition of the reality, <span class="cmt_word">that all things whatsoever which thou hast given me, are from thee.</span> There is no tautology here; the <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> are the truths, the fresh revelations, the glorious communion of the Son of man with the Father, which he made known to the disciples - truths which have a worldwide bearing, and also a direct bearing upon <span class="accented">themselves - are from thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). This obscure utterance, in its mystic vagueness, is clearly expounded in the next sentence, which is the echo of the grand assertion of <a href="../../par/john/16-30.htm">John 16:30</a>, which drew from the breaking heart its loud and sublime note of triumph. <span class="cmt_word">Because the words,</span> the various sayings, utterances of Divine reality, <span class="cmt_word">which thou gavest to me, I have given to them.</span> This blessed recital and exposition of his previous ministry is followed by the record of the effect, without which the whole Christian dispensation would that very night have come to an abrupt end. They believed that all Christ's words, works, energies, revelations, warnings, promises, like Christ himself, came from the eternal Father, therefore represented the supreme reality, more certain than demonstration, more vivid than intuition. They have rendered invincible assent to them as the Divine, absolute, unchangeable, irrevocable, eternal truth. In this overwhelming and satisfying conviction was laid the foundation of the Church of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And they received them</span>. This was a direct consequence of the Divine giving and of the Divine drawing. <span class="cmt_word">And they came to know</span> - discerned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by personal experience  - <span class="cmt_word">and truly that I came out from thee, and believed that thou didst send me</span>. This knowledge and belief is the germ of the communication to others of the Divine manifestation; it is the Lord's reward for all the toil and sacrifice and Divine humiliation of his earthly ministry (<a href="../../par/john/16-30.htm">John 16:30</a>). The incarnate Word is recognized as such, the only begotten Son of the Father is known to be the Brightness of his glory. We see in this great utterance the true origin of the evangelist's own words (<a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14-18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-5</a>). This thought of Christ's has now become their voluntary, spontaneous, assured conviction. The inward reason corresponds with the objective facts.

We must remember that this is perfectly consistent with the fact that, in the day of the spiritual manifestation to the disciples, when both the Father and Son came to them, the disciples would ask the Father for the gifts which his love to them was waiting to supply; and he, Christ himself, would hear them if they asked in his Name; and that then there would be no need that he should pray the Father for them. That time had not yet come, though it was coming. Both statements are also perfectly consistent with his "intercession" for us. <span class="cmt_word">Not concerning</span> - or, <span class="accented">not for - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the world am I praying</span>. Surely this is not an assertion that he would never pray, or that he had not already prayed, for the world. Nay, his entire ministry is the expression of the Father's love to the whole world (<a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). He came as Jehovah's Lamb to take away its sin (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), he bade his disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) pray for their enemies, and he cried at the last for a blessing on his murderers. He "came to seek and save the lost," to "<span class="accented">call</span> sinners to repentance," "<span class="accented">not</span> to condemn, but to save the world." Moreover, in this prayer (Ver. 21) he <span class="accented">does</span> pray for those who should ultimately, though they do not now, believe on him through the word of the disciples; therefore it is inconceivable that he should here dogmatically limit the range of his gracious desire. Calvin here observes, "We are commanded to pray for all (l Timothy 2:1)," and quotes <a href="../../par/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a> that Christ prayed for his murderers. "<span class="accented">We</span> ought to pray that this man and that man and every man may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we cannot distinguish the elect from the reprobate." Calvin implies that Christ is here within the sanctuary, and places before his eyes the secret judgments of the Father. Lampe goes much further. Luther <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">In</span> the same sense in which he prays for the disciples, he does not pray for the world." But the best explanation is that the high-priestly intercession at this supreme moment is concerned with those who were already given to him, and who have come to believe in his Divine Person and commission. He expressly and divinely commends to the Father <span class="cmt_word">those whom thou hast given</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> - the burden of the thought is contained in the motive he suggests for this commendation, viz. - <span class="cmt_word">because they are thine</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though thou hast given them to me, though they have "come to <span class="accented">me</span>," through thy drawing, they are more than ever "thine." This most fervent yielding to the attraction of Jesus, and utter moral surrender to his control, do not alienate the heart from the Father, but make it more than ever his. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-10.htm">John 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all things that are mine are thine</span>; whether they be these souls, or these powers that I wield, or these words that I utter, or these works that I do, - all <span class="accented">are thine</span>. This statement is in perfect harmony with all his teaching, and is not incompatible with the reverential sentiment that any servant of God might utter; but he adds words to show that the union between him and the Father is much closer than this, and quite unique. <span class="cmt_word">And thine are mine</span>. Luther observed, "No creature could say this." Perhaps he went too far, because we are taught to believe that "<span class="accented">all</span> things are ours," etc., and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> covers much (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). In the full confidence of filial relation we can believe it true that the heavenly Father <span class="accented">says to</span> every one of his veritable children, "<span class="accented">All</span> that I have is thine." Here the words must not be drawn out of their connection; it is human souls who are of God, and are therefore Christ's. The dogmatic lesson is that every one who has heard and learned of the Father does come to him. Such an assurance gives a sublime hope to the world, <span class="cmt_word">and I</span> (<span class="accented">have been and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>am glorified in them</span>. Once more the Divine Savior rejoices in the victory he has won in securing the faith of the disciples. How much he loved and trusted them! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <i>are</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I am no more</span> (no longer) <span class="cmt_word">in the world</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>). The earthly ministry is over; for a while he must leave them in the pitiless storm, bereft of his care and counsel, exposed to infinite peril and temptation. Headless, scattered, tempted to believe that all he had said to them was one huge delusion. <span class="cmt_word">And these are in the world</span>, without me, without visible sight of the mirror in which thy glory has been reflected, <span class="cmt_word">and I come</span> - I return - <span class="cmt_word">to thee</span>.

This grand title stands here in solitary grandeur (though let Ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>, be noticed, and the fact that <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a> speaks of "the Holy and True," and <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a> of "the Holy One"). The very holiness of the Father is appealed to as the surest basis of the petition. They have already been taught to pray, "Hallowed [made holy] be thy Name." The eternal holiness and righteousness of God is involved in the saving and sanctification of the believer in Jesus. "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them, holy Father" (says our Lord), <span class="cmt_word">in and by thy Name, those whom thou hast given me.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading of the T.R., on the very feeble authority from the codices, simply D2, 69, and some versions. It is also thus quoted by Epiphanius twice; but the reading of all the best uncial manuscripts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, L, Y, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x394;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3a0;</span>, etc., numerous versions and quotations, is <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Some very unimportant manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span>, which Godet prefers as practically equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span>, regarded as a unity, "that which," and as calculated to explain the <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> of the uncials, and the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;</span>. Lachmann, Tischendorf (8th edit.), Tregelles, Meyer, Westcott and Herr, and R.T. all read <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span>, which is thrown by attraction to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> into the dative, and requires the translation, <span class="cmt_word">Keep them</span> (<span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the power of thy Name which thou hast given me</span>. And since <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> is a resolution of the attraction, it is quite as likely that <span class="accented">it</span> is a correction of <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> as that the reverse process should have taken place. The expression is very peculiar, but not inexplicable. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a> is the best illustration of the clause. It reads, according to the true text, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath bestowed on him the Name (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which is above every name," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eternal Name, the incommunicable Name (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>) of Jehovah. Meyer objects to this that the Father's Name was simply given him as an ambassador or for purposes of revelation and manifestation. This may be a partial limitation of the thought. He has already said, "<span class="accented">I</span> have manifested thy Name, thy fatherhood to the men," etc. And now he adds, "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them in the power and grace of this glorious Name, of which my Person and message have been the full expression." <span class="cmt_word">That they may be one</span>, united, formed into a unity of being, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are</span>, not losing their personality, but blending and interchanging their interests and their affections after the Divine pattern of the Father and Son. The relations between Christians, which constitute the essential unity of their corporate being, are of the same kind as those which pertain to Christ and God, and prevail between them, therefore lying far behind the shifting phases of organization and human order, in the essence and substance of spiritual life. Some writers have found in this analogy between the union of believers and the hypostatic union of the Persons of the Godhead, either a species of tritheism in the Godhead, or a minimizing of the entire conception to what is called moral union between the Father-God and his Son Jesus Christ. But the effect of the utterance is rather to lift the idea of the unity of the body of Christ to a superlative height, and to interpret still further the nature of its oneness with the Father and Son (see Ver. 23). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a></div><div class="verse">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While I was with them</span> (in the world).

This an earthly father might say, without irreverence, of children whom he was about to leave, but the quality of the <span class="accented">keeping</span> is characterized by the Divine Name which was given him, and that manifested the Sonship which carried with it all the revelation of the Father. <span class="cmt_word">And I guarded</span> (them) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> signifies watchful observation; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, guardianship as behind the walls of a fortress - <span class="cmt_word">and not one perished</span> - went to destruction - <span class="cmt_word">except that the son of perdition</span> (has perished). Christ does not say that the son of perdition was given him by the Father and guarded from the evil one, and yet had gone to his own place; the exception refers simply to the "not one perished." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> has occasionally a meaning not exactly equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>, but expresses an exception which does not cover the whole of the ideas involved in the previous clause (see <a href="../../par/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, etc.). This awful Hebraistic phrase is used by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>) for antichrist, and numerous phrases of the kind show how a genitive following <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> expresses the full characteristic or the chief feature of certain persons (thus cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.). This victim of perdition, this child of hell, has completed his course; even now he has laid his plans for my destruction and his own. He has so perished <span class="cmt_word">in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> Even if the full telic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is preserved here, he does not free the "son of perdition" from the responsibility of his own destruction. The Scripture portraiture of Messiah has been realized. <a href="../../par/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which has already been quoted by our Lord in <a href="../../par/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>, is probably still in his mind (cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-12.htm">Isaiah 57:12, 13</a>). Some commentators - Arch-deacon Watkins, Dean Alford - press the fact that the "son of perdition" must have been among those who were given to Christ by the Father, who were watched, guarded, taught by God; but that Judas nevertheless took his own way and went to his own place. Thoma compares the lost disciple with the lost sheep of the synoptists, as though we had a reference to a true reprobate, a son of Belial, Apollyon, and the like. Moulton justly protests against any countenance being found here for the irrevocable decree. But if the interpretation of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> given above is sound, there is no inclusion of the traitor among those who are "of the truth," etc.; but he was one who, notwithstanding boundless opportunity, went to his own place in the perversity of his own will.

This verse simply repeats, with alteration of order, the clause of Ver. 14 as the basis of the next great petition. Ver. 14 draws the comparison between Christ and the disciples; Ver. 16 lays, by a transposition of words, the greater emphasis on "the world." Alas that this great utterance should so often be utterly ignored! How often in our own days, is other-worldliness and unworldliness derided as a pestilent heresy, and "a man of the world," instinct with its purpose and saturated with its spirit, lauded as the true man and ideal leader of a Christian state!

The <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to sanctify, is not synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to purify; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> not a contradiction of the defiled so much as of the purely natural, and involves the higher ends of grace (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>). The sanctification of the Old Testament is a ritual process effected by ceremonial observance; the sanctification of the New Testament is a spiritual process passing over heart and conscience and will, and is the work of the Divine Spirit. Meyer, Westcott, and others translate the next clause, <span class="cmt_word">in the truth</span>, as the atmosphere in which the disciples dwell; but a large number of commentators, with Godet, take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> as equivalent to" by the aid of," with the instrumentality of, "the truth:" consecrate them, by revealing to them the reality, making known to them the truth. If they see the truth they will be discharged from the illusions of the world, the flesh, and the devil. (Luther takes <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> adverbially, and as equivalent to "<span class="accented">verily</span> and indeed; but this cannot well be, seeing the article is present, and taking account of the subsequent definition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it becomes improbable.) But what is "<span class="accented">truth"</span><span class="accented">?</span> what is the full expression of reality? how are we to know where to find it? <span class="cmt_word">Thy Logos</span> (thy Word), the utterance of thy thought, <span class="cmt_word">is truth</span>. If we can ever cognize what is the Divine thought about anything, we shall reach the absolute truth. What God troweth is truth per <span class="accented">se</span>. The Logos of God, the full, God-chosen utterance of the reality of truth, is the nearest approach to truth that we possess. This revelation of God is the closest correspondence with the reality. God sanctifies his children, consecrates them to the service of his kingdom by revealing the truth, by making known the otherwise transcendental facts of his kingdom. A long controversy has prevailed in the Church as to whether the Spirit's gracious operations are or are not limited by the operation of truth on the mind. Numerous assurances of the New Testament seem thus to limit the grace of God, or to measure it by the ordinary effect produced on the understanding by Divine truth; e.g. "Of his own will begat he us by the Word of truth;" the parable of the sower, and other Scriptures. But seeing that the regeneration, the conference of new and supernatural life, is set forth by images of resurrection and new creation, and as a purification of taste, bias, and desire, the gift of a new heart and right spirit, the voice of a heavenly sonship crying within us, "Abba, Father," and seeing that the ministration of the Spirit is variously directed and operative, and that there is shadowed forth an immediate work on the heart," back of consciousness" itself, and that the witness of the Spirit and the teaching and indwelling of the Holy Ghost are continually referred to, - we are loath to accept the dogma. The Spirit of God is not limited to the normal operations of the Word.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a></div><div class="verse">That they all may be one; as thou, Father, <i>art</i> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they all may be one</span>. My prayer is that the many may become one, form one living glorious unity; - every part of which spiritual organism, while living a separate and differentiated life, is yet a part of a whole. In the natural sphere, as the parts of a whole organism are mere and more developed, and increasingly resemble individualities in their separation, they are in the same proportion dependent on the whole for the life that is in them. Even in a highly organized community, as the separate individuals have more and more personal consciousness of <span class="accented">special</span> function, they become the more dependent on the whole, and in one sense lost in the unity to which they belong. The branches in the vine form together one vine; the members of a body, being many, are one body and members of one another. It is open to discussion whether the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> clause, which here follows, characterizes the above statement, as Meyer and many others urge, or whether, with Godet, the sentence, "That they all may be one," should not be taken as a general statement, to be followed by the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> clause, which characterizes the following words. The first method is a more rational interpretation, nor does the sentence drag. <span class="cmt_word">According as thou, Father</span>, (art) <span class="cmt_word">in me, and I</span> (am) <span class="cmt_word">in thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the relation between the Father and Son, the manner in which the Father lives in the Son, as in his organ or instrument of manifestation and object of supreme affection, and as the Son is in the Father, abiding ever in the light of his glory, in the power of his Name, and as these two are thus One in being, so, or similarly, the believers are to live in and for each other, becoming a unity, just as the Father and Son are unity. <span class="cmt_word">In order that they themselves also may be</span> [one] <span class="cmt_word">in us</span>. This <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> does not offer a parallel sentence in apposition with the former, nor is the "that" to be inverted, with Godet, who translates, "that according as thou.., they also may be one in us;" but it is the climax of the whole unifying process, after the likeness of the union between the Father and the Son, viz. that they themselves may be included in this unity. Though they are thus to be lost in God, yet they do not lose their own individuality. Nay, in proportion to their organic relation to the fullness of the Godhead and the completeness of their own spiritual fellowship with one another, will this personal consciousness of theirs become more and more pronounced. There is yet a further process contemplated, viz. <span class="cmt_word">in order that the world may believe</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;</span>, as in the next verse; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;</span>, in the present subjunctive, rather than the aorist) <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me</span>. The spiritual life and unity of the Church will produce an impression on the world which now rejects the Christ and does not appreciate his Divine commission. The union which springs from the blended life of the various and even contradictory elements in the Church will prove the reality of its origin. The world will believe, - this is the final purpose of the intercession concerning the disciples; so though above he did not pray for the world as the then immediate object of his intercession, the poor world is in his heart, and the saving of the world the end of his incarnation. If the union between the Father and the Son is the sublime type of the union between those who shall believe, it is not the union of a great society in accordance with certain invincible rules of affiliation and government. The union between the Father and Son is <span class="accented">not</span> a visible manifestation, but a spiritual inference. The common indwelling in the Father and Son, the identity of the spiritual emotion and purpose in all who have one Lord, one faith, one baptism, will convince the world by producing a similar inference. Alford: "This unity is not mere outward uniformity, nor can such uniformity produce it. At the same time, its effects are to be real and visible, such that the world may see them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - Our Lord now proceeds to record how he has already contributed to produce this result. <span class="cmt_word">I also</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">have given to them</span> - that is, to my disciples - <span class="cmt_word">the glory which thou gavest me</span>. Numerous interpretations of this "glory" have been suggested, as <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, the glory into which he is about to enter in his glorified body; but the emphatic perfect <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, in connection with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, viz.: "I have given and am now and still giving," renders this improbable. Meyer, who does not accept Baumgarten-Crusius's view that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here means "to destine," yet comes very much to the same thought, and regards it as the heavenly glory of which he had eternal experience, and would ultimately share with his people. But the view variously set forth by Oldhausen, Hengstenberg, Maldonatus, Bengel, Tholuck, Moulton, and Godet appears to be in full harmony with the context, viz. the glory of the supernatural life of Divine Sonship and self-sacrificing love as of the very essence of God. This glory that he should taste death for every man, this glory of nature and character as the incarnate Head of a new humanity, I have given to them, <span class="cmt_word">in order that they may be one</span>, living in and for each other, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are one.</span> The contrast between his own relation to the Father and theirs is most wonderfully maintained. The union between the Father and Son is once more made the type, in his own unique consciousness, of the union among men who have received as his gift the eternal life and glory of a supernatural love. This is more evident from what follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a></div><div class="verse">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I in them, and thou in me</span>.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is that of the Son of God, manifested in Christ's consciousness of the God-man-hood; the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> is the eternal and non-incarnate God.

Each individual believer reaching the highest perfection of his being, as according to his own capacity and function he fills his place in the one living body of the Lord The end is not here, however, so far as others are concerned; for this unity, when consummated, is to bring about a yet further result on this earth, and <span class="cmt_word">in order that the world may come to know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;</span>.) <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me, and lovedst them as thou lovedst me.</span> Our Lord has advanced upon the assertion of Ver. 21, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by discriminating between "believing" and "coming to know" by personal experiences, overwhelming conviction, and processes which lead to invincible assent. Faith in its highest form melts into knowledge, full assurance, complete certitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There is superadded to the conviction concerning the Divine mission of the Christ yet another, viz. a conviction of the wonderful love which thou hast shown to them in thus lifting them out of the world into the unity of the spiritual life, into the fellowship of the Son of God. This has twofold bearing. So far as the world is concerned they will see that the love shown to the believers in Christ will be compatible with the same kind of treatment as Christ himself received, and so far as the Divine reality is concerned, it will be seen that they are so closely identified with Christ that the infinite love of God to Christ flows over in its Divine superabundance upon those who are gathered together into him. It is impossible to exclude from these verses the idea of the <span class="accented">visibility</span> of the union and life of the Church, and of the Divine love to it. Nothing is said or hinted, however, about the <span class="accented">nature</span> of that visibility. Christians are not, by reason of their differences, to exclude from this passage the promise that the whole assembly of the Firstborn would make this gracious and convincing impression on the world. They are far enough, in days of mutual recrimination, from realizing the Divine ideal, and should set themselves to remedy the crying evil; but they have no right to import into the words, by reason of their predilection for particular forms of Church organization, an identification of the body of Christ with any specific form. The spiritual union of Christendom in its one faith, hope, and character, is, notwithstanding the divergence of some of its forms of expression, the most stupendous fact in the history of the world. The e<span class="accented">lite</span> of all Churches are drawing more and more into a visible unity.

The glory which he had already given to his disciples (Ver. 22) falls far short of this fellowship with him where his undimmed radiance shines, is only a preparation for sharing with him in his ultimate triumph over the world and death, and also for sitting down with him on his throne (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). In this world fellowship with him in his suffering humanity did not finally reveal the transcendent glory (though in <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> the apostle says, "We beheld his glory," etc.) of his Person. To realize this he prays, <span class="cmt_word">And that they may also behold the glory which is mine, which thou hast given me</span>. The glory given cannot be the glory of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, according to Meyer, for that is not given, but belongs to him by eternal right; yet Meyer admits that the Father gave the Son to have life in himself; and that even the eternal Sonship itself may be regarded as the eternal bestowment of an infinite love. Seeing that the Lord goes on to give a reason of his <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> founded on an eternal or at least pre-mundane manifestation of a conscious love, surely he is thinking of the exaltation of humanity into the eternal glory, which he distinctly relinquished and veiled in the days of his flesh. That which they had hitherto seen they only partially apprehended, though he had even given it to them (ver. 22), and though they had been drawn out of the world to high places of transfiguration, that they might behold it and learn how it coexisted with and was compatible with a perfect resignation to the will of God in human redemption. Our Lord prays, nay, <span class="accented">wills</span>, that they should hereafter see it in its fullness of grace and beauty, see it when relieved from obstructive hindrances due to the flesh and to the world, see it on the grandest scale, see it as it really <span class="accented">is</span>, see the full capacity and infinite momentum of the glory which he had already bestowed upon them. <span class="cmt_word">For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span> This, say Meyer and Luthardt, is given as a reason of the prayer for his disciples, not as an explanation of the glory which he had with the Father before the world was. It is often said that the exaltation of the Son of man is a reward for his self-humiliation, and the crown of his sacrificial death (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>), but these very passages couple that exaltation with the premundane glory of him who was, to begin with, and before his work of redemption, the "Effulgence of the Father's glory," who was "in the form of God," and regarded the being equal with God as no <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;</span> as a thing to be seized, prized, and held in its integrity. And in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>, "<span class="accented">He</span> was by reason of his intended passion crowned with glory and honor, in order that he might taste death for every man." So that the glory which he had with the Father before the world was, and therefore before his incarnation, was that very glory of self-devoting and unutterable love into which he would come again with all the trophies of his redemptive work. The new and higher embodiment of his humanity would prove of such a kind that his essential glory would shine through it in undimmed luster. If this be the meaning, we cannot dilute this pregnant saying, one of the most mysterious of all his words, one which leads us up to the highest possible conception of the relations between the Father and the Son. The eternal love of which the Godhead itself is the SOURCE and the OBJECT is that to which we shall be introduced, and which our Lord would have us see and share (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1-3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a></div><div class="verse">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The prayer is thus over, and once more the great High Priest and Victim declares concerning himself some of the mysteries of his Person and of his relation with his disciples and with the world. <span class="cmt_word">O righteous Father</span> (cf. Vers. 1, 5, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> simply; Ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>; Ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> without any characterization). The righteousness of God is a more exalted perfection than his holiness, one that might seem more at variance with the exercise of his paternal compassion; yet this righteousness is conspicuously displayed in the redemptive love which Christ had thus manifested, and the beloved disciple (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>) declares that God is faithful and "righteous" in forgiving the repentant sinner. The blending of the idea of righteousness with Fatherhood is the sublime revelation made by the Lord Jesus, and he gathers the two ideas together into an indissoluble unity. Justice and mercy are seen by the whole work of the Son of God to have been the outflow and effulgence of the one all-comprehending and infinite love. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> that here follows has created some difficulty, though some manuscripts emit it (D and Vulgate), probably in consequence of its inappropriateness; but it is received on strong ancient authority. Meyer and Hengstenberg take it thus: <span class="accented">Righteous Father</span> (<span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">such thou art</span>), <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">yet</span>) <span class="accented">the world knew thee not</span>. But would our Lord have hesitated, as it were, to express this truth, without justifying it against the unbelief of the world? Moulton tries to explain the simple adversative force of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "both the world learned not to know thee, but I learned to know thee." Godet has expressed the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> more effectively by  translating, <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">world</span>, <span class="accented">it is true</span>, <span class="accented">knew thee not</span>, <span class="accented">but I knew thee</span>. The Revised Version has, with the Authorized Version, simply omitted the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>. It is one of the most solemn of the Lord's condemnations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Apostle Paul said (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>), "The world through its wisdom knew not God;" and in <a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-23</a> he shows that this ignorance was willful and practical and without excuse. The history of the struggling of the world after God has shown how dense the human darkness is. There have been signs that men groped after the idea of a Father who should be blind to their faults and indifferent to their follies, and utter a righteous Lord who has exalted righteousness and hated iniquity; but it was left for Christ to blend these apparently discordant beams into the radiance of a perfect glory. How many illustrations do the sad and shameless perversions of human intelligence supply! <span class="cmt_word">But I knew thee</span>, because of the eternity of that ineffable love wherewith thou hast loved me, and because of the depth of that righteous love which thou hast manifested to the world in sending me upon my mission. <span class="cmt_word">And these knew</span> - came to know by personal intuition - <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>, and Vers. 8, 23) on the mission of redeeming the world. They have learned that I have come with all thy authority and in all thy power; that I have come out from thee; that I entered into the world; that I have glorified thee among men; that my thoughts are thy thoughts, and my "words" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) are thy (Logos) "Word;" that my works of love are the works of the Father; and that my promises are the manifestation of thy Name to the men whom thou hast given me. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/17-26.htm">John 17:26</a></div><div class="verse">And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare <i>it</i>: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Since they have "learned that thou sourest me," our Lord, to complete the awful monologue, adds, A<span class="cmt_word">nd I made known thy Name to them</span>, pointing back to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 6. "To make manifest" is not equal in potency with "to make known, to cause them to know;" there is more direct work done in them and to them in order to effect <span class="accented">knowledge</span>. Our Lord also declares that he has done this already, but his work of manifestation and teaching are not complete. There is more and more for these to learn. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I will make them to know it.</span> A promise of Divine expansion reaching onward and outward forevermore. By the power of his Spirit, by his return to them in his resurrection-life, by the ministry of the Paraclete, he would prolong and complete the convincing process. <span class="cmt_word">In order that the love wherewith thou hast loved me</span> (notice the unusual expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>; and cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>) - the eternal love of the Father to the well-beloved Son - the love which has flowed forth upon him as the perfect Son of man, and Representative of man, upon him who laid down his life that he might take it again (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">may be in them</span>; may alight on them as knowing, receiving, loving me (cf. <a href="../../par/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>, "The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me"). However much was involved in the utterance just quoted, in this closing utterance still more is conveyed. The waves on this boundless ocean of love pour in, one behind the other, each nobler and freighted with richer blessing than that which preceded; and the motive of this infinite fullness of eternal love being thus lavished upon them is added: <span class="cmt_word">I in them</span>. On this profound suggestion he has already said much, but not until we reach these last words do they flash forth in all their mystic grandeur. His life will be so identified with their life, his abode so blended with their being, his life so repeated in their experience, his personality so much entwined and blended with theirs, that he in them, and because he is in them, prolongs and repeats himself as the Object of an eternal love. We see the same ideas in the Pauline teaching, and can only explain <a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9, 10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>, as echoes of the class of teaching which, long before John had recorded the prayer in this form, had yet become the seed and life-principle of the Church. This is not only true of the closing verses, but of the whole prayer and preceding discourse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> <span class="accented">Review of the difficulties attending the preservation and characteristics of this discourse and prayer</span>. The sublime comprehensiveness of the prayer; its augmenting swell of thought; the awful depth of its self-consciousness; the limpid simplicity of its style; the movement from himself to his disciples, to the entire Church, to the outlying world; the ground on which he bases every prayer; the imperial dignity of the Pleader; the total absence of any sense of personal weakness or sinfulness; the revelation and insight thus granted into the heart of the God-man; its naturalness, if we concede the foregoing character; its profound humility, if we bear in mind his unique claims; - constitute this page a supernatural phenomenon. Christ himself is the greatest of his miracles. The supposition that some unknown writer of the second century excogitated such a conception out of the synoptic narrative, the Pauline Epistles, and the Alexandrine philosophy, refutes itself. We admit, with F. W. Newman, with Reuss, and with all the rationalist critics, that it is difficult to understand how the apostle could have reproduced so accurately this wondrous discourse and the prayer; but the author practically admits that it was a supernatural process of memory (<a href="../../par/john/14-25.htm">John 14:25, 26</a>). Still, there are facts enough in the natural sphere and within the knowledge of all, that such extraordinary efforts of memory are by no means uncommon. John was the contemporary of men whose surprising memory held the whole 'Mishna' and thousands of illustrative comments, 'Halacha,' and 'Hagada' ready for constant reference and application. The rishis of India, the Greek rhapsodists, mediaeval minnesingers, and wandering bards, have had imprinted indelibly and verbally on their recollection ten or twenty times the bulk of this wondrous discourse. John was young, impressionable, intimately acquainted with his Lord, though needing many things to complete his apprehension of his glory; and, even apart from Divine or spiritual aid, there is no reason to dispute its accuracy. The impression that this discourse and prayer have produced on the general consciousness of the Church, is, that none but Christ could have uttered these words, and he only at such a conjuncture. Keim <span class="accented">insists</span> that John, if it were he, by this narrative <span class="accented">annihilates the synoptic tradition</span> of the agony in the garden. And we do not deny that the intercalation of that agony between this prayer and the sublime manner in which Jesus meets the band of soldiers, renders a harmony of the Gospels at this point very difficult. The difficulty does not so much arise from the fact that the profound and awful strife should follow upon this sublime and lofty calm, upon this imperial and Divine prerogative, but that throughout the Johannine recital of the events which occurred on the night of betrayal and Passion, the same exalted demeanor is preserved, and numerous incidents and sayings are recorded which appear discrepant with the utter prostration and overwhelming affliction revealed in the synoptic narrative. This contrast must not be minimized, and cannot be disputed. The question to be decided is whether the twofold aspect of the scene can possibly represent the truth, or whether it proceeds from the theological prepossessions of a later writer, who imagined the behavior of the incarnate Logos under these conditions without any real and deep foundation in reality. By way of preface to an expository treatment, it is desirable to observe that John throughout received impressions from his Lord of a profoundly different character from that of the other observers, and throughout he saw the Divine manifestation which, while they witnessed it, they did not penetrate as he had done. The veil of the human phenomena concealed much from their spiritual apprehension. The different manner in which the same event is described by two witnesses, and the different constructions put upon the same action when viewed with diverse presuppositions, is of too common occurrence to need illustration. Luke represents the tradition concerning the Son of man in the hour of his deepest dejection. John represents what he saw of the ineffably Divine element which triumphed over the human. The angle of vision was different, the sensitive brooding and susceptible nature of John was unlike the impetuous human passion of Peter's soul, and the resultant impression on them both of the whole cycle of events was correspondingly different. Then let it be noticed that John, who knew the synoptic narrative, deliberately omitted what had <span class="accented">passed</span> into universal credence, such as the Transfiguration, the Holy Supper, and the Ascension: why was he not at liberty to omit the agony in the garden and the traitor's kiss? He takes up his story after the surprise was over, and when the Lord had resumed the tone of the voluntary Sufferer and Divine Savior; and if we compare the two descriptions of that scene, they supplement and explain one another. Numerous incidents throughout the closing scenes, which are omitted by John, are recorded by one or more of the evangelists, and some facts and words are peculiar to the Johannine narrative. These omissions from and additions to the synoptic narrative have been supposed to reveal the purpose of the theologian rather than the record of the eyewitness. It is rashly asserted that John omits the symptoms of human <span class="accented">weakness</span> and shame, and exaggerates the signs of Divine indwelling and of lofty prerogative. This, however, is by no means true. He does omit the agony in the garden, but he gives in <a href="../../par/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. the analogue of that awful scene, and the same Divine spirit with which it was consummated. He omits the "traitor's kiss," but he hints the occurrence of that crowning treachery. He does omit the record of the desertion by the disciples, but (<a href="../../par/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a>) he records the prediction of it. He omits the incident of the false witness and the adjuration, but it should in all fairness be remembered that he also omitted the great confession of the Lord's Messiah-ship and exaltation; and while he passes by the incidents of the mockery of the Lord, he records other matters and methods of mockery which are equally humiliating (<a href="../../par/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a>). If he omits the examinations before Caiaphas and Herod, he gives that which the synoptic tradition had lest sight of in the first examination before Annas and in the private interview with Pilate. The hand-washing of Pilate and the dream of his wife are passed over, but the conduct of Pilate is made far more intelligible by that private interview. The evangelists Luke and Matthew both record features of sorrow and words from the cross and pot-tents attending the Crucifixion, which confer a royal prerogative and a Divine significance on his death. The rending of the veil, the confession of the centurion, the great earthquake, the supernatural darkness, the repentance and acceptance of the dying brigand, - all these we might reasonably expect, on the theory of theological prepossession, to have been found in the Fourth Gospel; and what is more remarkable still on that hypothesis is that the most peculiar and pathetic feature of the last hours is an exhibition of Christ's perfect humanity and filial love, which the other narrators fail to touch (<a href="../../par/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25-27</a>). We conclude, therefore, that the matters in which the narratives agree are abundant and remarkable, and their divergences cannot be accounted for on the ground of theological bias. The exposition of the following chapters will bring the several lacunae, correspondences, and peculiarities into yet fuller prominence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/18.htm"><title>John 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/17.htm" title="John 17">&#9668;</a> John 18 <a href="../john/19.htm" title="John 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <a href="../../par/john/19-42.htm">John 19:42</a>. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The outer glorification of Christ in his Passion</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> -<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The <span class="accented">betrayal</span>, <span class="accented">the majesty of his bearing</span>, <span class="accented">accompanied by hints of the bitter cup</span>.

The stream rises north of Jerusalem, and separates the city on its eastern side from Scopas and the Mount of Olives. It reaches its deepest depression at the point where it joins the Valley of Hinnom near the well of Rogel, contributing to the peculiar physical conformation of the city. The stream is in summer dry to its bed, and Robinson, Grove, and Warren conjecture, in agreement with an old tradition, that there is, below the present surface of its bed, a subterraneous watercourse, whose waters may be heard flowing. The stream takes a sudden bend to the southeast at En-Rogel, and makes its way, by the convent of Saba, to the Dead Sea. It is not without interest that this note of place given by St. John alone - for the three other evangelists simply speak of "the Mount of <span class="accented">Olives"</span> <span class="accented">- brings</span> the narrative into relation with the story of David's flight from Absalom by the same route, and also the Jewish expectation (<a href="../../par/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>), and Mohammedan prediction, that here will take place the final judgment (Smith's 'Dictionary,' art. "<span class="accented">Kedron</span>," by Grove; 'Pictorial Palestine,' vol. 1; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:269: Winer's 'B. Realworterbuch,' art. "Kedron;" Dean Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine;' 'The Recovery of Jerusalem,' by Capt. Warren and Capt. Wilson, <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. and 5.). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a garden</span>. This reference is in agreement (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32</a>) with the synoptic description of the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "parcel of <span class="accented">ground</span>," small farm, or olive yard, enclosed from the rest of the hillside, and called "Gethsemane"  (<span class="accented">gath-shammi</span>, press for oil). The traditional site of the garden dates back to the time of Constantine, and may be the true scene of the agony described by the synoptists. There are still remaining "the eight aged olive trees," which carry back the associations to the hour of the great travail. It is certain that the general features of the scene still closely correspond with what was visible on the awful night ('Pictorial Palestine,' 1:86, 98). Patristic and mediaeval writers, with Hengstenberg and Wordsworth, see parallels between the garden of Eden lost by man's sin, and the garden of Gethsemane where the second Adam met the prince of this world, and bore the weight of human transgression and shame, and regained for man the paradise which Adam lost. It is still more interesting to notice a further touch recorded by John: <span class="cmt_word">Into which</span> - into the quiet retreat and partial concealment of which - <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">entered himself, and his disciples</span>. We know from the other Gospels that they were separated -eight remained on watch near the entrance, and Peter and James and John went further into the recesses of the garden, and again, "about a stone's cast," in the depth of the olive-shade, our blessed Lord retired to "pray." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Judas also, who was betraying him</span> (notice present tense in contrast with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">knew the place: because oftentimes Jesus resorted</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was assembled there</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thither with his disciples</span>. Luke tells us that during this very week (<a href="../../par/luke/21-37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>) they had passed their nights (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) on the "Mount of Olives," and it is most likely that Judas conjectured that they had gone thither again to pass the night. The fact here mentioned by John, that Judas knew the place, disposes of the ignorant and vulgar taunt of Celsus, that our Lord sought to escape from his enemies after having challenged them (see Orig., 'Contra Cel.,' 2:9. 10). Keim, with perversity, declares that John only represented the place as known to Judas, in order to enhance the voluntary nature of the sacrifice. Some explanation may thus be given of the fact that the eleven disciples, having reached an accustomed place of repose, all slumbered and slept, and were not able to watch one hour. The choice of this particular garden for the purpose cannot be unraveled. Dean Plumptre <span class="accented">suggests</span> that it was the property of Lazarus, who was no other than the rich young man, who sold his all and gave to the poor, all but one solitary garment, and that he himself was keeping this one <span class="accented">possession</span> for the <span class="accented">uses</span> of his Lord on that very night, and that when in danger of arrest he it was that fled away naked. This is pure conjecture.

The article (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) is probably used because the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, military tribune, chief captain, or commander of the thousand men, had (Ver. 12) accompanied the detachment.

It should, however, be observed that the word is used of the Roman garrison of the tower (<a href="../../par/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:04. 3; ' Bell.

The strength of the cohort differed according to circumstances and need. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:04. 2) says that some <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> consisted of a thousand, some of six hundred, men. It is not rational to suppose that the whole cohort were visibly <span class="accented">present</span>, but they were-present in close proximity. Though John alone mentions the Roman <span class="accented">soldiers</span>, yet cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53, 54</a>, where our Lord says, "Thinkest thou not that I could pray (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">my Father</span>, <span class="accented">and he would henceforth furnish me with more than twelve legions of angels?"</span> - a legion of angels for each one of the little group. The presence of this band of Roman soldiers with the Jewish police gives very great force and impressiveness to this scene of Israel's degradation and of the world's assault upon the Divine Savior. The other hints given by the synoptists of the presence of weapons in the "band," is Peter's use of the sword. Judas brought with him, not only the drilled and armed Roman soldiers, but <span class="cmt_word">the officers from the chief priests and of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Pharisees</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a detachment of the Jewish guard of the temple, under direction of the Sanhedrin. The chief priests would have small difficulty in securing the aid of a detachment of the Roman garrison to prevent popular outbreak at the time of the feast. These <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, under the direction of the chief priests and Pharisees, have been mentioned in <a href="../../par/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> and 45, and the same name is given to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/5-22.htm">Acts 5:22, 26</a>, where the high priests and Sadducees are spoken of as their masters.

Jud.,' 2:17.2) - not two, but one; the reference to more than one must therefore point to the Roman military official as well, thus unconsciously sustaining the more definite information given by John. Judas with his band <span class="cmt_word">cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons</span>; for, though it was the Paschal full moon, they were intent on finding an individual, whom Judas would identify for them, amid the depths of the olive shades. (<span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> is in its primary sense a torch, or even meteoric light, but it is used for a lamp or lantern; and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> also is used for "torch" primarily, with secondary meaning of "lantern.") Matthew and Mark mention "swords" and "staves," but say nothing of the flaring torches which so arrested the eve of John. Thoma sees a reference to the frequent declaration of Christ, that he was the "Light of the world," and to the contrast between that light and the power of darkness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-4.htm">John 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus then</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> implies that our Lord discerned the approach of the hostile band - <span class="cmt_word">knowing all the things that were coming upon him</span> - in full consciousness of his position, and in voluntary sacrifice of himself to the will of God and the purpose of his mission - <span class="cmt_word">went forth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the garden enclosure - see Ver. 1 - (say Meyer and Godet); from the recesses of the garden or the garden-house (say others); partly in consequence of the language of the kinsman of Maichus," Did I not see thee in the garden?" But this is perfectly compatible with the obvious fact that the eight disciples and the favored three should have shrunk behind our Lord when he calmly emerged from the entrance to the garden, and that their position would be thus sufficiently indicated. It is remarkable that John, who has been accused of personal malice to Judas (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by those who, like Renan, admit, to a certain extent, the Johan-nine authorship), does not refer to the traitor's kiss. This well-attested and traditionally sustained incident is not excluded by the narrative before us - indeed, the second reference to Judas seems to imply something special in his conduct, which is needed to account for it. We can hardly suppose that it could have taken place before the Lord Jesus had uttered his solemn word, but it may easily have occurred as the first answer to his summons. <span class="cmt_word">And saith unto them, Whom seek ye</span>? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-5.htm">John 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am <i>he</i>.

Jesus saith unto them, I am</span> <span class="accented">he<span class="cmt_word"></span>.</span> Then, in all probability, the miscreant, the son of perdition, said," Hail, Master!" and kissed him; and there followed before and after his act the sublime replies given, "Companion, wherefore art thou come?" and "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" John, however, overwhelmed with the majesty and spontaneous self-devotion of the Lord, calls attention to the language he addressed to the "baud" which surrounded him. In some royal emphasis of tone he said, "I <span class="accented">am</span> (he)," and the same kind of effect followed as on various occasions had proved how powerless, without his permission, the machinations of his foes really were. In the temple courts, and on the precipice of Nazareth, the murderous Jews and Galilaeans were foiled (compare the murderers of Marius and of Coligny) by the moral grandeur of his bearing; and <span class="cmt_word">when he said, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>). Whether this was a supernatural event, or allied to the sublime force of moral greatness flashing in his eye or echoing in the tone of his voice, we cannot say, but associating it with other events in his history, the supernatural in his case becomes perfectly natural. It was so that he whose "I am he" had hushed the waves and cast out the devil, and before whose glance and word John and Paul fell to the earth, as if struck with lightning, did perhaps allow his very captors (prepared by Judas for some display of his might) to feel how powerless they were against him. It is remarkable that our narrative should place between the "I <span class="accented">am he"</span> and its effect, the tautologous remark if there be nothing to explain it, <span class="cmt_word">Now Judas also, who was Betraying him, was standing with them</span>. This implies that Judas had taken some step equivalent to that described in the synoptic narrative. There is some momentary consolation in the thought that the traitor fell to the ground with his gang, and for an instant saw the transcendent crime he had committed in betraying the innocent blood with the kiss of treachery and shame. Thoma sees in the approximation of Judas the approach of the prophetic Beast to the true King, and endeavors out of the letters of his name to read the number 666! It is true that <a href="../../par/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a> represents Satan as having entered into Judas. He stood there, he fell there, with the powers of darkness. What a moment: The devil may have tempted Christ to blast his emissaries with the breath of his nostrils; but, true to his sublime mission, he is occupied only with the safety and future work of those who knew that he had come out from God.

The temporal safety of the disciples was a means on that dread night of saving their souls from death, as well as their bodies from torture or destruction. "Christ," says Calvin, "continually bears with our weakness when he puts himself forward to repel so many attacks of Satan and wicked men, because he sees that we are not yet able or prepared for them. In short, he never brings his people into the field of battle till they have been fully trained, so that in perishing they do not perish, because there is gain provided for them both in death and in life." The reference of the apostle to <a href="../../par/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a> is, moreover, also one of the numerous proofs which the Gospel itself supplies, that great, Heaven-taught as the apostle was, he stands, with all his inspiration, far below, at least on a different plane, from that occupied by the Lord. His occasional interjections and explanations of his Master's words calmer be put on the same level with the words themselves. Even Reuss finds here a reason for holding the authenticity of many at least of the sayings themselves, while refusing to accept the genuineness of the Gospel as a whole ('Theologic Johannique,' <span class="accented">in loco</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Simon Peter</span>. The other evangelists simply tell us that one of the number of the disciples performed the following act. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> here is introduced between Simon and Peter, as if to imply that it was not merely Simon son of Jonas, but Simon the Rock, the man of mighty impulsive passion, ready, as he said a few hours since, to go with his Master to prison and to death. The name and identification of Peter with the brave man who struck at least one blow for his Master, is a proof, not of John's animosity against Peter, or any desire to humble him, but rather to exalt him. The extraordinary concomitance of this act with all the other delineations of Peter's character is another undesigned hint of the authenticity of the narrative. Simon Peter, then, <span class="cmt_word">having a sword</span>. Here we see the unintentional agreement with the synoptic narrative (<a href="../../par/luke/22-38.htm">Luke 22:38</a>). Nothing would be less likely than that Peter should have a sword at his disposal; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> judging from the Johannine narrative. The Gospel of Luke explains it. Having a sword, he <span class="cmt_word">drew it, and smote the slave</span> (not one of the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, but <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, body-servant) of the high priest, and eat off his right ear. The slave, in receiving such a wound, must have been in fearful danger of his life. The reference to the <span class="accented">right</span> ear, mentioned also by Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-50.htm">Luke 22:50</a>), is noteworthy. <span class="cmt_word">Now the name of the slave was Malchus</span>. Here the eye-witness, not the theologian, nor the dramatist, reveals his hand. Thoma sees, however, the fulfillment of prophetic outline, and a reference to the kings and chief captains, the Malchuses and chiliarchs, that are ultimately to flee before him. The subsequently mentioned circumstance (Ver. 15) that the evangelist was "known to the high priest," explains this recovery of an otherwise valueless name. The instant when Peter cried, "Shall we smite with the sword?" was most opportune. For the moment Peter felt that the whole band could be discomfited by a bold stroke. Christ with his word, the brave-hearted apostle with his weapon, could scatter all the foes of the Lord. As on so many other occasions, Peter gives advice to the Master, only to find himself in grievous mistake. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - In Christ's reply there is no mention made of the miracle which followed, and yet the narrative is incomplete without it. Something must have restrained the baud and the high priest's own temple-watch from at once arresting Peter, if not the entire group. The characteristic touch, descriptive of our Lord's most Divine compassion, is in itself valuable, but it also accounts for the immunity of Peter. The solemn rebuke of Peter is full of Divine meaning, and is another link with the synoptic narrative of the agony. "Put up," or more literally, <span class="cmt_word">Cast the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sword into its sheath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the classical word; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> more generally used of repository, receptacle, sepulcher, etc.); or into its hiding-place; bury it away (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in Matthew). Matthew adds a memorable saying, but is silent as to the deep Divine reason of the submission of our Lord to his fate. <span class="cmt_word">The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it</span>? This imagery recalls the Passion, through which we learn from the synoptists that our Lord had passed into a Divine patience and submission to the will of God (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). The use of this most remarkable phraseology recalls that which John too had heard from his lips in the sweat of his agony, and of which he and Peter were the principal witnesses. The supplementary character of the Gospel, though by no means sufficient to account for all the omissions and additions of this narrative, yet does explain very much. "Jesus is now of his own accord at the disposal of his enemies; his words have put a stop to all further steps taken for his defense" (Moulton). (See Introduction, pp. 106, 107.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-27.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The <span class="accented">preliminary examination before Annas</span>, <span class="accented">interwoven with the weakness and treachery of Peter</span>. This passage describes the first steps taken by the enemies of our Lord to conduct the examination which was to issue in a judicial murder, and therefore to provide the basis on which the charge might be laid before Pilate and that Roman court, which alone could carry into execution the malicious conclusion on which they had already resolved. Moreover, tiffs passage is interwoven with the melancholy record of the fall of Peter. There are grave difficulties in the passage, which have led to harsh judgment on the narrative itself and on its general truthful ness. Keim almost angrily dismisses it, and Strauss endeavors to show that it is incompatible with the synoptic narrative; while Renan, on the other hand, sees in it numerous lifelike touches and great circumstantial value. The <span class="accented">prima facie</span> objection is that John describes a preliminary examination before Annas, whom he confounds with the high priest, and says nothing of the judicial trial before the Sanhedrin under the presidency of Caiaphas. Baur and Strauss supposed that the author did this in order to exaggerate the guilt of the Jews by doubling their unbelief, and aggravating their offence by making <span class="accented">two</span> high priests rather than one condemn their Messiah. In reply to this we have simply to say that John, though he shows the animus of both these notorious men, does not mention the judicial condemnation pronounced by either (see Weiss, 3:334, Eng. trans.). The omission of the sublime answer of our Lord to the challenge of Caiaphas and others (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-62.htm">Matthew 26:62</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/22-67.htm">Luke 22:67</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/mark/14-68.htm">Mark 14:68, 70</a>) is surely profoundly contradictory to the supposed theological purpose of the writer; and we can only account for its omission on the ground that the synoptic tradition had made it widely known, and that <span class="accented">that</span> tradition still needed correction by the record of important supplementary matter. Some harmonists have endeavored to transpose Ver. 24 into close proximity with Ver. 13, or to give, as the Authorized Version does, a pluperfect meaning to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> of Ver. 24, the effect of which is to make the two examinations virtually one, but one from which John leaves out the most striking features. This is supposed to be necessitated by the Vers. 19-23, where the "high priest" is said to have interrogated Jesus. Moreover, the supposition of there being a considerable space in the city between the house of Annas and the palace of the high priest Caiaphas renders the harmony of the narratives touching the denials of Peter inextricably confused, seeing that, according to the synoptic narrative, they occurred in the court of <span class="accented">Caiaphas</span>, while in John they apparently were made in the court of <span class="accented">Annas</span>. This difficulty is entirely met by the natural suppositions arising out of the relations of these two men. Annas (Hanan, Ananias, Ananus) was a man of great capacity and exclusiveness, charged with fiery passions and bitter hatred of the Pharisaic party. He was appointed high priest in A.D. , by Quirinus, Governor of Syria; in A.D.  he was compelled to retire in favor of his son Ishmael. After him followed Eleazar, and in A.D.  Joseph Caiaphas, his son-in-law, was appointed, and this man held the office till A.D. . Three other sons of Annas held the like position, and it was during the high priesthood of one bearing his father's name (Ananus) that James the Just was cruelly murdered (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:08. 1). The influence of the old priest throughout the entire period covered by New Testament narrative was very great. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2</a>) speaks of Annas and Caiaphas as high priests, and Annas is again in <a href="../../par/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a> spoken of as high priest. John never speaks of him as "high priest," unless he must be held to do so in this passage. Our most thoughtful commentators differ on the point whether John does not so designate him (Ver. 19), adopting the well-known usage of Luke, which gave him the title of high priest. The evangelic narrative reveals, however, quite enough to explain that he may have been at the heart of the antagonism to Jesus, have aided Caiaphas with his suggestions, and consented to conduct a preliminary midnight investigation which would give at least a semblance of legal sanction to the condemnation, which, between them, they would be able to secure as soon as the day dawned. In tract 'Sanhedrin,' Mishna, <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a> and John 5:5, we learn that, though an acquittal of a prisoner or accused person might be pronounced on the day of trial, yet a capital sentence must be delayed till the following day. As this trial must be brought at once to a termination, such an investigation as that which John describes would furnish the necessary validity. Moreover, some hours must have elapsed before the Sanhedrim under the legal superintendence of Caiaphas, could have assembled. Now, the domestic relation of Annas and Caiaphas would make it highly probable that the hall of the Sanhedrin and the house of Annas were on different sides of the same great court of the palace, and that one court, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, sufficed for both. With these preliminaries, let us proceed with the narrative as given by John. The frivolous supposition of Thoma, that the author of this Gospel was playing upon the idea of the beast (Judas) and the false prophet, and on the five <span class="accented">brothers</span> of the rich man of Luke's parable, is allowed to disfigure this writer's treatment of the introduction of the part taken by Hanan, or Annas, in the Passion-tragedy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> since no further resistance was made by Jesus - <span class="cmt_word">the band</span> (or <span class="accented">cohort</span>), which here takes the lead, <span class="cmt_word">and the captain of it, and the officers of the Jews</span> in association with each other, <span class="cmt_word">took Jesus, and bound him</span>, as sign that he was their prisoner, and to prevent escape until he should be in safe keeping. It is probable that the binding process was repeated by Annas and again by Caiaphas (Ver. 24 and <a href="../../par/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>), implying that during judicial examination the cordage was taken off, and reimposed when the accused was sent from one court to another; or else that additional bonds were placed upon him, for the sake either of greater security or of inflicting indignity. Christ, by accepting the indignity publicly, yielded his holy will, confessing the supreme ordinance of the Father as to the method in which he would now glorify him. <span class="cmt_word">And they led</span> (<span class="cmt_word">him</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to Annas first</span>. The mention of the word "first" shows that John discriminated between the two legal processes, the first being a preliminary examination of the accused, with the view of extracting from him some matter which should furnish the priests with definite charges, and to make a show of partial conformity with the customs of their own jurisprudence. <span class="cmt_word">He was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that same year.</span> John's reiteration of this statement (see <a href="../../par/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49</a> and note) shows that he was in no ignorance of the custom and principle of high-priestly succession, which the Romans had treated so arbitrarily. "That same year" was the awful year in which the Christ was sacrificed to the willful ignorance, malice, and unbelief of the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Now Caiaphas was he who counseled the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die</span> <span class="cmt_word">for the people</span> (see <a href="../../par/john/11-50.htm">John 11:50, 51</a>); and while John leaves no doubt who is the virtual high priest, he calls attention to the fact that Jesus had no justice or mercy to expect from the decision of his judge, and  also reminds his readers once more of the significance of every step in this tragedy.

After the first dispersion of all the disciples, two of them gathered up their courage. <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter was following Jesus</span> "afar off" (say all the synoptists), "even <span class="accented">up to"</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f64;&#x3c2;</span>, the court of the high priest" (say Matthew and Mark). The account of Matthew implies that, having come up to the door, he went <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, and sat down to see the end; he does not say how he was admitted, though, by the use of the two prepositions, he implies there was a cause. And also <span class="cmt_word">another</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciple: but that disciple was known to the high priest,</span> and therefore to the officials, <span class="cmt_word">and went fix with Jesus into</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, right within) <span class="cmt_word">the court of the high priest</span>; for he was well known to be, and from the first did not pretend to be anything else than, one of the disciples of Jesus. From the known habit of the evangelist in other places, the vast majority of commentators at once conclude (see Introduction, p. 54.) that the writer designates himself by this reference. Godet and Watkins are disposed to question it, and imagine that it may have been the author's brother James. With the absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the matter is left in doubt. But by this supposition much of the justification is lost, which the writer of the Gospel quietly supplies, touching his own ability to describe what otherwise would never have entered into the evangelic narrative. The supposition we have made above, that Annas and Caiaphas occupied the same palace, or different portions of the same edifice, solves the chief difficulty. Annas held his preliminary unofficial inquiry in his department of the building. The difficult question arises whether Annas was assisted or not by the reigning "high priest" in conducting this examination (see Ver. 19). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-16.htm">John 18:16</a></div><div class="verse">But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Peter was standing at the door without</span>. Up to this moment Peter had only pressed as far as to the outer door; the other disciple had gone bravely in. The hum of voices was now deadened by the closed door dividing Peter from his Lord. The height, the cold, the strange blighting of all his expectations, the necessary conviction forced upon him that he had implicated himself by the assault he had delivered on the servant of the high priest, combined to induce a new and desponding mood. All hope had fled. Then John bethought him of the condition of his friend, and so we read that <span class="cmt_word">the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, therefore went out</span> to the entrance-door, and finding Peter there, <span class="cmt_word">spake to her who kept the door</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a>). His appeal may easily be supplied - <span class="cmt_word">and he brought in Peter</span>. The other evangelists imply that before Peter was challenged the fire of coals had been lighted, and that the apostle, with the servants and with the rest of the group who had apprehended Jesus gathered round it. He placed himself as if he were an unconcerned spectator, identified himself, as it were, rather with the captors than with the Lord; nor is the narrative of John inconsistent with the synoptic statement. In Ver. 18 the incident is certainly introduced by the writer after he mentioned the challenge. Still, he states it as a condition of the denial rather than as a subsequent event. Matthew describes his position as "without, in the court," not in the audience-chamber, but in a court opening "upon" it or "above" it, as Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-66.htm">Mark 14:66</a>) implies. Luke tells us he was "sitting m the midst of the court," with the glow of the burning charcoal on his face, "he was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>," where the maiden might see him more attentively than when she hurriedly admitted him. "The other disciple" had moved swiftly on to some corner where he could see and hear all that was happening to the Master. But Peter's first step downwards had been already inwardly taken. Before he had verbally denied his Lord, he had acted as though he were indifferent to the result (see Hanna's 'Last Day of our Lord's Passion,' <a href="../../par/john/2.htm">John 2</a>.). Matthew's and Mark's accounts represent Peter's first and other denials as taking place after the mockery of Jesus that followed upon his great confession of Messiahship. Luke places them all three together before the formal examination or confession, and before the judicial condemnation. John's account throws much needed light upon the synoptic narrative, which is more inconsistent with itself than with that of the Fourth Gospel. Matthew's method of putting together into connected concurrent groups miracles, events, sayings, or parables which are allied to each other, will explain the substantially identical report contained in his and Mark's Gospels. There are with all differences some remarkable coincidences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> All four accounts describe our Lord's prediction of Peter's denial. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> All four evangelists agree to represent the first temptation as proceeding from "a certain maiden," "one of the maids of the high priest," or "a damsel." John's Gospel explains the point by saying, <span class="cmt_word">the maid who kept the door</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">said therefore</span>, seeing she had admitted him, not in the rush of the other servants, but at the request of "the other disciple" - considerable meaning is thus put into her words, which is lost in the synoptists by lack of the hint already given By John - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span>, as well as my acquaintance yonder, <span class="cmt_word">also one of this Man's disciples? He saith, I am not</span>. The other evangelists amplify this negative in various ways. Mark, the reporter of Peter's own preaching, aggravates throughout the heinousness of Peter's fall, adding, "He denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest." His position was sufficiently taken, and he thought to have established for himself a perfect incognito.

The synoptists know or say nothing of this first examination, which bears upon it strong marks of authenticity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-19.htm">John 18:19</a></div><div class="verse">The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the following incident with the thirteenth and fourteenth verses. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>. Hengstenberg, Godet, and Westcott here say that the high priest is Caiaphas, present <span class="accented">i.e. at</span> the examination over which Annas presides as the older man; but Renan, Meyer, Lange, Steinmeyer ('Passion and Resurrection History'), and Moulton, with many others, say Annas was here the high priest in question. Tholuck dismisses the idea of Annas altogether, and, by inverting the place of Ver. 24 or treating the  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> as pluperfect, suppose that Annas <span class="accented">had</span> sent the Lord to Caiaphas (so Calvin, De Wette, Hase, and others), who thus commenced his interrogatory. But the text of Ver. 24, now recovered, will not admit of this rendering. We find it far more satisfactory to accept this less formal examination, under the presidency of Annas, at which an attempt is made to put the Lord, if possible, to a test which will incriminate him. Keim says, "If Caiaphas were the acting high priest, and at the same time the soul of the movement against Jesus, it was for him and not for his father-in-law to take knowledge of the matter and report to the Sanhedrin." We must choose between two difficulties: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Caiaphas is first spoken of as "high priest," who, as we know from the synoptists, conducted the examination-in-chief, and then that Annas, as conducting a preliminary examination, is also styled "high priest" without any explanation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> or we must admit the supposition that after Caiaphas had asked these incriminating questions, <span class="cmt_word">Annas</span> (who was not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), sent Jesus bound <span class="accented">to Caiaphas the high priest</span>. The former hypothesis is the easier. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples</span>, the extent of his following, the number of his accomplices, the ramifications of the society or kingdom he professed to have founded, and <span class="cmt_word">concerning his doctrine,</span> the secret teachings that held his followers together. He evidently knows the claims of Jesus well enough; his spies and officers have continually been dogging the steps of Jesus, and hitherto he has failed to gain evidence positively incriminating him. And as his representatives a few days ago were utterly foiled, notwithstanding their clever design, he hopes by his own ingenuity to entrap the Lord in his talk. Our Lord, anxious not to endanger his disciples, points to the publicity of his ministry, and appeals to all and sundry who have heard him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered him, I have frankly</span> (so Meyer, Lange; not "openly," but boldly, with freedom of speech) spoken to the world.

Christ here repudiates esoteric teaching distinct from his abundant public ministry. It is true he explained his parables to his disciples, and he had within the last few hours poured forth the depth of his feelings upon them; still, he had said the same things virtually in the synagogues, on the hillside, in the temple, in the hearing of Greek as well as Jew. Much of that which he had just said in the upper chamber, hundreds and thousands had already heard. This great utterance accounts for the fact that St. Paul had received, long before the Fourth Gospel was written, truth allied to the teaching of the upper chamber. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-21.htm">John 18:21</a></div><div class="verse">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why askest thou me?</span> If thou wantest <span class="accented">evidence</span> touching my design, my disciples, or my teaching, <span class="cmt_word">ask</span>, <span class="accented">interrogate</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>those who have heard me, what I have said to them.

Christ thus rebukes the craftiness and hypocritical endeavor of his enemies to induce him to inculpate his disciples, or to give his prosecutors matter against him. To false witnesses he preserved an invincible silence, and before Caiaphas and Pilate he answered to many of their queries not a single word, insomuch that these governors marveled greatly. However, the case was altered when Caiaphas, in full Sanhedrin, officially challenged him to say whether he was the Christ, and adjured him to declare whether he was the Son of God. Then, on the most public scale, knowing well the issues of his declaration, and of his oath-bound word, he did not hesitate to confess that he was the Son of God, and would come in the glory of his Father, and that he was no less than the Christ of God. On the present occasion, when Annas was seeking to justify his own craft, and to utilize the disgraceful betrayal which he had diplomatically and cruelly contrived, Jesus refused to incriminate either himself or his disciples. Renan has the temerity to say that this great announcement was quite superfluous, and probably was never made. Any conclusion whatever may be derived from historical documents, if such liberties may be taken with impunity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had said these things, one</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the officers standing by,</span> anxious to win with his officious zeal the approval of his master, gave Jesus a <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>.

Thus he took no notice of the charge brought against him. <span class="cmt_word">But if I have spoken well, why smitest thou me?</span> A quiet appeal to the conscience of the wretched upstart who dared to insult the Lord of glory. It is thus that the Lord explained the spirit of his own injunction, "Whosoever shall smite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other also" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>). Nothing was gained by this private interrogatory except an appeal to the outside world of his hearers, and a call for testimony; and no decision could be legally taken against him without incriminating evidence. Dr. Farrar ('Life of Christ') has pointed out with great force that the chief priests and Pharisees, from their intestine animosities, had great difficulty in formulating any specific charge. The Pharisaic ratty, if they made a point of his doctrine and practice concerning the sabbath, would have been foiled by the Sadducean latitudinarians; and the priests did not dare to call in question his imperial cleansing of the temple, knowing that the Pharisees would immediately have justified the act. Consequently, Arums limited his inquiries to the supposed esoteric character of some private teachings to his initiated disciples - a charge that was refuted by the continual publicity and openness of all his teaching. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a></div><div class="verse">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> is quite in John's style, and the verse should read, <span class="cmt_word">Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the full court of the Sanhedrin, under the presidency of Caiaphas, now got together for the judicial sifting and verdict. If John had intended a pluperfect sense to be given to the verb, why not use that tense? The relative clauses, where the aorist is used for the pluperfect, are not relevant here (Meyer). In other cases the context clearly reveals the occasion of such a sense (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-5.htm">Matthew 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48</a>). John is not unaware of the momentous consequences of this act of Annas, seeing that he refers to them, nor of the fact of the accusation made by the false witnesses, nor of the judicial condemnation which followed Christ's own claim to be the Son of God. The subsequent narrative implies such condemnation (Vers. 29, 30, 35; <a href="../../par/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>). The author of this narrative does not ignore the fact of the appearance before Caiaphas, nor the issue; but in consequence of the wide diffusion of the synoptic Gospels, he merely called attention to the facts which they had omitted so far as they bore directly on the human character of the Lord. The theological bias with which the evangelist is credited by some would be strangely subserved both by the omission of the scene before Caiaphas, and by the faithful record of this purely human and beautiful trait in the personal character of Jesus. The fact that the fourth evangelist should have recorded facts of which he was eye-witness, and omitted others which would have forcibly sustained his main thesis, is an invincible evidence of historicity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-25.htm">John 18:25</a></div><div class="verse">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.

In startling contrast to this scene, and while Annas had completed his bad-hearted but foiled inquisition, possibly even while our Lord was being transferred from the one court to the other - an event which provided an opportunity for the searching, loving, compassionate glance which broke Peter's heart - the second and third denials of Peter were also being enacted. <span class="cmt_word">Now Simon Peter</span>, who had been challenged by the doorkeeper, <span class="cmt_word">was standing and warming himself</span> (a form of verbal construction of auxiliary verb with participle to which John is addicted, and especially in those portions of his Gospel which represent his personal composition; <a href="../../par/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6, 9, 24, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24, 27</a>) - "standing," not "sitting," as Luke describes his position at the <span class="accented">first</span> denial, having, we might suppose, impetuously changed his position. <span class="cmt_word">They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples?</span> This sentence of John really gathers up another moment of Peter's terrible fall, variously and even discrepantly put by the synoptic narrative, and is virtually accordant with them all three. According to Matthew "another maid," according to Mark "the maid" who had first challenged him, returned to the assault. Nothing more likely than that what was said by one woman should be eagerly taken up by another, and therefore that both statements are true. Luke, however, describes the event thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "another man" (perhaps "a different person") saw him and said, "Thou art one of them." John's statement embraces the substance of all three statements, "They said unto him." The general resemblance of the second charge brought against the apostle, as stated by all four evangelists, is remarkable. The different personages by whose lips the charge was urged can best be explained by the occurrence of simultaneous and widely spreading conviction, instead of an unnecessary multiplication of the denials themselves. Matthew and Mark represent Peter as overhearing the conversation of the maids with those who were there (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), showing the obvious occasion for some eager <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to take up their statement as an accusation. The difficulty of place is not so easily resolved, for Matthew and Mark speak of the "gate," <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "porch," outer hall of the court, and John of the fire where Peter first sat in apparent unconcern.

According to Matthew he was moving towards the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, probably in the stir of the procession from the house of Annas to the court of Caiaphas.

Thus according to Matthew and Mark "after a little while," according to Luke "about the space of one hour after," an effort was made to identify Peter by. some sign of his association with Jesus. All the synoptists re. present it as turning on his provincial, Galilaean, speech, but John gives a closer point of identification. There were thousands of Galilaeans in Jerusalem, and this was a feeble ground of proof, though it may have corroborated the suspicion of the maidens and others, that Peter was an accomplice of the hated Nazarene; but the charge came home in terrible earnest and verisimilitude as recorded by John. His account is far more lifelike, forcible, and circumstantial. The fourth evangelist says, <span class="cmt_word">One of the servants</span> (<span class="greek_word">doulw  =  n</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did I not</span> <span class="cmt_word">see thee in the garden with him?</span> The historically attested fact gave the lie to Peter's previous assertions. Clearly he was seen and recognized and in imminent peril, and he is now more vehement than ever. Matthew and Mark tell, "tie began to curse and swear, saying, I do not know the Man." John, with less feeling of reproach, says, <span class="cmt_word">Peter therefore denied again</span>. The intercessory prayer, the solemn warning, the agony in the garden, above all, the following of the sublime encouragements by this fearful failure, the ignominious binding and rude indignity offered to the Man who had claimed to be the Vicegerent and Image and Glory of the Father, combined to shatter Peter's courage, though it did not annihilate his faith (see Steinmeyer and Weiss). The Lord had prayed that his faith should not fail. He was sifted as wheat, but the apostle <span class="accented">knew</span>, even in the depths of his shame, that he <span class="accented">was</span> a poltroon and coward, and that the Lord was everything he said he was. But meanwhile he <span class="accented">denied again</span>, he kept up with his violence of language, his hypocritical denial of his own faith - <span class="cmt_word">and straightway the cock crew</span>. Mark, who had made the prediction of our Lord cover a twofold cockcrowing, records the twofold fulfillment; John, who in <a href="../../par/john/13-38.htm">John 13:38</a> had given the prediction "before the cock crow," here shows how Peter must have been reminded of his Lord's preternatural knowledge and forecast. So that, though John does not mention the repentance, he refers to the well-known occasion of it, and, moreover, shows more forcibly than either of the synoptists the extraordinary tenderness of the risen and reconciled Lord to his erring and cowardly disciple. Some extreme harmonists have spread out the fault of Peter into nine distinct acts of treachery; others have reduced them to seven or eight. M'Clellan, in a powerful note (p. 447), urges that there were "twice three," or six distinct denials. Matthew and Mark report three denials while the trial before Caiaphas was going on; these <span class="accented">are</span>, according to M'Clellan, entirely distinct from John's "first denial," which preceded even the lighting of the fire. Nor does he allow that Luke's first denial, "sitting at the fire," can coincide with John's "second denial," which must also have preceded that which Luke gives as the first, and that John's "third denial" is distinct again from Matthew's third, Mark's third, and Luke's third. Thus he makes John's account entirely supplementary to the synoptists. Peter may have used a variety of expressions on each occasion, and each challenge may have been accompanied by some features not especially noted as to posture or place, but the arrangement adopted in the text represents a threefold assault upon the apostle, which had three crises of intensity and terrible result. Taking Matthew and Mark as virtually identical, Luke's account as a separate tradition with reference to the second denial, and agreeing with Matthew and Mark in the third, and in his first with John's second, we have three denials once more following the prediction. John's account, whether distinct or not from the other two records, bears the same relation to our Lord's previous announcement that the synoptists' do to theirs, and shows that in no quarter was there a general belief in <span class="accented">more</span> than <span class="accented">three</span> virtual acts of apostasy. Mark alone mentions a twofold warning from the cock, one after the first denial, and on Peter's going out to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or the enclosure, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and again after the third denial. M'Clellan and others find a threefold denial before each crowing of the cock. Certainly John has omitted the entire scene detailed by the synoptists in the hail of Caiaphas, viz. the calling of the witnesses; the lack of harmony in the false witnesses; the adjuration of Caiaphas; the wondrous confession of the persecuted and bound Sufferer; the verdict pronounced against him, on the part of all assembled, that he was guilty of death; the first cruel mockery; and the very early assembly of the entire Sanhedrin - all the chief priests (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) and. elders of the people (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-1.htm">Mark 15:1</a>, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and all the Sanhedrin). The synoptists assure us that the object of this council - which was probably held in the celebrated chamber of the temple appropriated for the purpose - was to adopt the most suitable measures for immediately carrying their unanimous judgment into effect. As we shall see shortly, John is perfectly aware of such a measure having been taken (see not only Ver. 31, but <a href="../../par/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47</a>, etc.). Nevertheless, he passes on at once to the legal and civil trial before the Roman proprietor. This is not the place to discuss the twofold trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin. Derembourg, Farrar, and Westcott suppose that the first demands of the high priest, as to whether he was the Christ, as given by Matthew and Mark, were different from the scene described by Luke, where he claimed <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> to be seated on the right hand of the power of God, and suppose that this last was the occasion, when the verdict was given by the Sanhedrin in full session, not in the palace of the high priest, but in the "Gazith," or possibly in the "Booths of Hanan," on the Mount of Olives. Luke clearly discriminates between <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/22-54.htm">Luke 22:54</a>), and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> of Ver. 66.

The word is used primarily for the general's tent in the Roman camps, and for the legal residence of the chief of a province. Now, the ordinary residence of the Roman governors was at Caesarea, but at the time of the great feasts they were in the habit of going up to Jerusalem, and at a later time than this (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:14. 8; 15:5) the governors utilized for this purpose the former palace of Herod, a gorgeous residence in the upper city. It is, however, more probable that Pilate occupied the palace of the Castle of Antonia, overlooking the northwest corner of the temple area, and having means of direct communication with it. Edersheim inclines to the palace of Herod. From the high-priestly palace to the castle they led Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">And it was early.</span> [In <a href="../../par/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x1fd6;&#x1ffd;</span> is equivalent to the fourth watch of the night, between three and six o'clock. The breadth of the phrase would cover the period of the hurried council (see <a href="../../par/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15.htm">Mark 15</a>.) and the session of Pilate. The Roman judgments were often conducted in early morning (Seneca, 'De Ira,' 2:7) <span class="accented">- prima luce</span>.] The council having in their indecent haste conveyed Jesus to the Praetorium, while (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they themselves went not into the Praetorium,</span> <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be defiled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, the solemn word for "profane" in Plato, Sophocles, and the LXX.). This defilement by entrance into the house of a Gentile was not an enactment of the Law, but was a purely rabbinic observance (Delitzsch, 'Talmudische Studien,' 14. (1874); 'Zeitschrift fur die gesammte Luth. Theol.'). We find it operative in <a href="../../par/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>, and thus a hint given not merely of the author's knowledge of the inner life of Judaism, but of his quiet recognition of the stupendous spectacle of malicious ritualism, and of unscrupulous antagonism to the Holiest One, busying itself about attention to the letter of that which was only a rabbinic legislation. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">might eat the Passover</span>. Here in this passage we come once more face to face with the persistent puzzle occasioned by the divergent intimations of John and the synoptists as to the day of our Lord's death. In <a href="../../par/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-14</a> this very phrase is used for the preparation of that Paschal supper which our Lord celebrated with his disciples (see Introduction, pp. 93, etc.). So that we have at any rate a discordant verbal usage, however the problem be solved. The day is breaking, which constitutes, according to John (<span class="accented">prima facie</span>), the 14th of Nisan, in the evening of which and commencement of the 15th the Passover would be killed. According to the synoptists, that Passover meal was already over, and the first great day of the feast had commenced - the day of convocation, with sabbatic functions and duties. The statements are apparently in hopeless variance. Many emphasize, exaggerate, and declare insoluble the contradiction, repudiating either the authority of John or that of the synoptists. Meyer and Lucke give their verdict with John, the eye-witness, as against the synoptic tradition. Strauss and Keim, who also hold the invincible discrepancy, lift the synoptic account to a comparatively high state of historic validity, and thereby discredit the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel. We have two methods of reconciling the difficulty: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> An endeavor to show that the synoptic narrative itself is inconsistent with the idea that the night of the Passion was the night of the general Passover. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> That the entire proceeding of the trial was inconsistent with the feast-day; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that Simon the Cyrenian could not bear the cross on that day; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the circumstance that that Friday evening was the preparation of the Passover; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> that the reckonings of the weeks till the Pentecost Sunday are all made to show that the <span class="accented">synoptic</span> narrative itself admits that the Crucifixion took place <span class="accented">before</span> the Passover meal. So also does the decision of the priests, that they would put Jesus to death <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-5.htm">Matthew 26:5</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-2.htm">Mark 14:2</a>). On this understanding the passage before us is  interpreted in its natural sense; the Jews were unwilling to contract ceremonial defilement, because they were about to eat the Passover, and so with respect to the other references in John's Gospel, which all, <span class="accented">prima facto</span>, suggest the same chronological arrangement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A very powerful argument has been constructed, however, which brings John's account here, as well as elsewhere, into harmony with the supposed assertion of a synoptic narrative, that the Paschal meal preceded the trial of Jesus. It is said by Hengstenberg, M'Clellan, Edersheim, and others that this unwillingness to defile themselves was because they were anticipating their midday meal, at which sacrificial offerings and thank offerings, also called <span class="accented">chagigah</span>, were regarded as "eating the Passover" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7-9</a>). It is argued that, if the Jews were thinking of a meal which would not come off till sundown, their fear of defilement was illusory. But examination of these passages shows that there is a distinction drawn between the Paschal <span class="accented">lamb</span> and the cattle which might form part of the general sacrificial feasting of the following days, and that the term "Passover" is strictly limited to the Paschal <span class="accented">lamb</span>. <span class="accented">M</span>oreover, the duration of the defilement thus contracted would certainly have prevented them from any participation in the <span class="accented">slaying</span> of the Paschal lamb "between the evenings" of the 14th and 15th of Nisan. Dr. Moulton has made the ingenious suggestion that John's statement here is brought into harmony with the synoptic narrative, by the supposition that the chief priests had been disturbed in their Passover preparations, and were intending to complete their meal as soon as the decision of the Roman governor had been given. This very supposition reveals the exceeding unlikelihood that all the hierarchs and chief scribes, Pharisees, and elders of the people had consented to forego the due solemnization of their national rite on that previous evening. This supposition involves a much greater violation of Passover regulation than that Jesus and the twelve should have anticipated the ceremony by a few hours. If the day is the 14th of Nisan, all, so far as John's account is concerned, is obvious. I am therefore disposed to agree with Meyer, Keim, De Pressense, Baur, Neander, De Wette, Ebrard, Ewald, Westcott, Godet, and Lucke, against Hengstenberg, Wieseler, Tholuck, Luthardt, M'Clellan, and many others. The full interpretation of the synoptic narrative is discussed elsewhere (Introduction, p. 92.). Certainly John makes no reference to the Passover in his account of the Last Supper, neither does he refer to the institution of the Lord's Supper. It will not be just to say, with Renan, that John has substituted the foot-washing for the sacramental least. (On the principle of his omissions, see Introduction, pp. 100-105.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-29.htm">John 18:29</a></div><div class="verse">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate therefore</span>, because of their rooted national prejudice, <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them</span> beyond his court, to some open space convenient for hearing the case. Pilate is introduced here without any preliminary statement or title, as though the position of the man were well known to his readers - another proof that the synoptic narrative is presupposed. This scrupulousness contrasts with the summary proceeding of Herod Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2</a>), and with the conduct of the Roman authorities (<a href="../../par/acts/22-24.htm">Acts 22:24</a>). The very question he asks implies that something had conspired to provoke a certain sympathy on his part with Jesus, and to excite additional suspicion of the Jews. The statement of <a href="../../par/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a> may account for the former. The fact that he was ready to hear the case at this early hour shows that he must have been prepared for the scene, and even primed for it. Pilate (the manuscripts vary between <span class="accented">Peilatos</span> and <span class="accented">Pilatos</span>) was the fifth governor of Judaea under the Romans, and held office from A.D. -36. He is represented by Philo ('Legatio ad Caium,' 38) as a proud, ungovernable man; and, in his conflicts with the Jews, he had especial reason to detest their obstinate ceremonial and religious prejudices. Philo speaks of Pilate's "ferocious passions,What accusation do ye bring against this Man?</span> He may have known, probably did know, but chose to give formality to the charge, and not simply to register their decrees. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-30.htm">John 18:30</a></div><div class="verse">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered and said, if</span> <span class="cmt_word">he were not a malefactor,</span>  <span class="cmt_word">we should not have delivered him up to thee.</span> This was somewhat audacious. It was as much as to say, "We have judged, you have only to register our decisions. We are not bound to go through our evidence before you." If it had been so, the deprivation of the <span class="accented">jus gladii</span>, the power of capital execution would have mattered little to them. Pilate, in scorn and irony, replies, "If that be so, why have ye brought him to me? If you are unwilling to comply with the terms of Roman jurisprudence, then it must be some ease which you can dispose of according to your own rules." <span class="cmt_word">Take ye him yourselves, and according to your Law judge him</span>. Pilate saw their animus, and that they were thirsting for the blood of Jesus, and wished at once to flout them and make them confess their impotence and admit his suzerainty. For them to judge (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) was not equivalent to put to death (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and Pilate clearly suggested that much. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews</span> [<span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>] <span class="cmt_word">said to him, It is not lawful</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to us to put any man to death.</span> This was perfectly true, notwithstanding the tumultuary and violent acts and threats, and incipient stonings of Jesus, to which the Gospel refers (<a href="../../par/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3, 59</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-25.htm">John 7:25</a>). Other interpretations of this exclamation have been supplied, viz. "to execute criminals of state" (Krebs), "to do so on feast-days" (Semler); but the power had been formally taken from even the supreme court, forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem. The instance of the massacre of James the Just, occurring between the departure of one Roman governor and the arrival of another, is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 20:09. 1) as a distinct infringement and violation of law. The stoning of Stephen in a wild tumult, and the proceedings of Herod Agrippa, are rather confirmations than violations of the rule. Thus the malign disposition and distinct purpose of the Jews were revealed. They would not have brought Jesus at all before the Roman governor, nor admitted his claim to decide any case involving religious ideas and practices, if they had not fully decided that Jesus must die. Bat John sees a deeper reason still. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</div><div class="comm">

The manner of the death had been foretold by our Lord. In <a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a> he spoke of being lifted up (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), in <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a> he charged the Jews with the intention of so lifting him up to die (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), implying a method of capital punishment which was contrary to their ordinary habits; and in <a href="../../par/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a> he declared that this lifting up of the Son of man would create part of his sacred and Divine attraction to the human race. In the synoptists he is said to have repeatedly spoken of his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>); but in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a> he had clearly predicted his crucifixion by the Gentiles (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 23</a>). The manner or kind of death was full of significance; it provided opportunity for the royal demission of his own life; it gave conditions for much of the sublime self-manifestation of the closing hours; it has proved, notwithstanding all the shame and curse of the proceeding, eminently symbolic of the compassion with which he embraced the human race in all its defilement and all the variety of its need. We are not surprised to find that the evangelist saw, in the complicated relations of Jewish and Roman authority, a divinely ordered arrangement, and a clearly foreseen and predicted consummation. <a href="../../par/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a> shows that the charge brought against Jesus was made to receive a coloring likely to prejudice the Roman governor against him: "We found this Man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King." The uproar and the false and malicious charge would be more likely than any other to move Pilate against him; and thus the synoptic narrative, being presupposed, gives an explanation of the first question which John, as well as the synoptists, represents Pilate as first of all pressing upon the Divine Sufferer. Without Luke's statement, Pilate's question is abrupt and in. explicable; but it must be admitted that there is in John's narrative no direct hint of Luke's addition; and Christ's counter-question to the inquiry of Pilate (which last is given in the same form by all four evangelists) implies that he had not overheard the false charge which the Jews had brought into the court. The Lord was within the Praetorium. Pilate and the Jews were on the open, external space, where the altercation proceeded. We may also, with Steinmeyer, observe that nothing could appear more anomalous to Pilate than that these bigoted and rebellious priests, who perpetually resisted the claims of Roman governors to enforce tribute, should now hypocritically pretend that a prophet-leader of their own had been guilty of such a charge. Instead of resisting, the Pharisees would have fostered a demagogue who had taken such a disloyal part. Pilate would at once have suspected that there was something ominous in the very charge itself, when tumultuously pressed by a party who were accustomed to regard such proceedings as patriotic; and he saw with shrewdness that the Jews had merely cloaked their real antagonism by presenting an incrimination which, under ordinary circumstances, they would have treated as a crowning virtue. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33</a></div><div class="verse">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-38.</span> - (b) [Within the Praetorium.] <span class="accented">Christ's admission that he was a</span> .<span class="accented">King</span>, <span class="accented">but that his kingdom was not of this world</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33, 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate therefore entered again</span> <span class="cmt_word">into the Praetorium</span>, out of direct hearing of the vociferous crowd, where Jesus and John himself had remained under supervision of the officers of the court, and called - summoned -Jesus to his side, and said to him that of which the mob outside formed an imperfect idea. The account of John throws much light on the inference which Pilate drew from the reply of Jesus, as given in Ver. 38 and in <a href="../../par/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>. To the loud accusations and bitter charges of "the chief priests and elders" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3, 4</a>) brought in the presence of Pilate, Christ answered nothing. His solemn and accusing silence caused the governor to marvel greatly (see both <a href="../../par/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/15-5.htm">Mark 15:5</a>). He marveled not only at the silence of the Lord, but at that silence after he, Pilate, had received from him so explicit a statement as to the nature of his own kingdom. An explanation of the motive of Pilate, and of his entire manner upon this occasion, is to be found in the private interview between our Lord and the Roman governor within <span class="accented">the Praetorium</span>. It is unnecessary (with many) to see in Pilate an "almost persuaded" believer in the claims of Jesus, who yet was warring with his better judgment, and apostatizing from a nascent faith. He appears rather as the Roman man of the world, who has never learned to rule his policy by any notions of righteousness and truth, and is utterly unable to appreciate the spiritual claims of this Nazarene; yet he was shrewd enough to see that, so far as Roman authority was concerned, this Prisoner was utterly harmless. His question was, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the King of the Jews</span>? Of course, he expected at first a negative reply. Should this abused and rejected, this bound and bleeding Sufferer, with no apparent followers around him, actually betrayed by one of his intimate friends, deserted by the rest, and hounded to death by the fierce cries of Pharisee and Sadducee, chief priest and elder, answer in the affirmative, it might easily suggest itself to Pilate that he must be under some futile hallucination. It has been said that the question might have been answered right off in the affirmative or in the negative, according as the term "King of the Jews" was understood. If what Pilate meant was a popular titular leader, <span class="accented">imperator</span> of Jewish levies, one prepared for the career of Judas of Galilee, or Herod the Idumaean, or for that of Barchochab in after times, - nothing could seem to be less likely or more patently repudiated by the facts; moreover, from our Lord himself, who had always refused a quasi-royal dignity (<a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>), it would have required an emphatic negative. Pilate knew no other way of interpreting the phrase. If the term meant the true "King of Israel," the Messiah anticipated by prophecy and psalm, the King of all kings and Lord of lords, the Ruler of hearts, who would draw all men to him, and east out and vanquish the prince of this world, then the "crown" was his, and he could not deny it; but before this assertion was made in the hearing of the multitude, our Lord would draw from Pilate the sense in which he used the words. He does not say to him, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou sayest" -a reply given verbatim by all the synoptists, and referring to a <span class="accented">second</span> demand made in the presence of the multitude - but he put a counter-question, <span class="cmt_word">Sayest thou this thing,</span> askest thou this question, from <span class="cmt_word">thyself?</span> - from thy knowledge of the hopes kindled by the ancient books, or from comparing my words with my appearance, or from any judgments thou hast formed a <span class="accented">priori?</span> (so Godet, Neander, Olshausen, and Ewald). Thus Jesus was not so much informing Pilate of the distinction between the two kingships, as claiming <span class="accented">qua</span> Prisoner at the bar the source of the accusation. "Have I put forth any claim of this kind, which thou as the chief magistrate of this Roman province hast any legal cognizance of?" It was not, as Hengstenberg and Westcott suggest, an appeal to the man rather than to the <span class="accented">governor</span>, to the conscience of Pilate rather than to the forms of the tribunal; but (Meyer), with the intrepid consciousness of perfect innocence of the political crime, our Lord asks for the formal declaration of the charge brought against him. <span class="cmt_word">Or did others tell it thee concerning me?</span> Alford, Lange, Schaff, etc., all agree with Godet in supposing that Christ was discriminating between the theocratic and the political use of the great phrase. It is obvious that he did rise from the latter to the former in the following verses, but it is difficult to find the distinction in this alternative question. "Did others (not thine own police or observation) - did the Jews, in fact, bring thee this charge against me? Nay, did they not? Is it not entirely due to this outbreak of hostility to my teaching that they have chosen thus to impeach me before thee - to deliver me to thee?" Therefore, first of all, Christ repudiated the charge, in the only sense in which it could have conveyed any colorable idea to the mind of Pilate.

Whatever inner reasons these Jews had to malign Jesus and confuse Pilate's mind with the ambiguity of the title, the governor is innocent as yet of any such theocratic or religious meaning in the charge. More than this, the humiliation of the Divine Lord of men, the King of Israel, is grievously aggravated by the very use of the word. "Thy own nation has delivered thee up, has betrayed thee to me." The crime of Judas has been adopted by the religious authorities and the patriotic leaders of the people. "He came unto his own, and his own people received him not." Christ frequently anticipated this result of his ministry; and he regarded it as the climax of his indignity (see especially <a href="../../par/luke/9-44.htm">Luke 9:44</a>; and cf. the language of St. Peter, <a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>), that the anointed King should by his own people be "delivered" up to lawless Gentile hands to be crucified and slain. Pilate assures him that, if he is now in his hands, the cause of it is simply that his own people had utterly repudiated his claims, whatever they may have been. <span class="cmt_word">What didst thou do</span> to transform into thy bitter enemies those who would naturally condone or favor any such claim as that of being a seditious rival to the Roman Caesar? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - In reply to this challenge, <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span> - obviously assuming the fact that he was a king in a sense entirely different from that which had been maliciously suggested to Pilate - <span class="cmt_word">My kingdom</span> - the kingdom that is mine - <span class="cmt_word">is not of this world.</span> Neither now nor at any future period will it derive its origin from this world. So far as Christ is King, his royal power and state are not furnished by earthly force, or fleshly ordinances, or physical energies, or material wealth, or imperial armies. The dominion that he will wield will be one over hearts and lives; the authority of the Lord Jesus cannot be arrested or overpowered by physical force. Most commentators justly regard this as a spiritual manifesto of the sources and quality of the kingdom of Christ, and a foreshadowing of the separation between the spiritual and secular power - a declaration that all effort to embody Christian laws and government in compulsory forms, and to defend them by penal sanctions and temporal force, is disloyalty to the royal rank and crown rights of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hengstenberg regards the assertion as precisely the reverse; sees in the passage, "rightly understood, the very opposite purpose. The kingdom that sprang directly from heaven must have absolute authority over all the earth, and it will not submit to be put into obscurity. The kingdoms of this world must become the kingdom of the Lord and his Anointed, and he shall reign for ever and ever." This is true, but not along the lines or with the machinery of earthly rule and authority. The influence and authority of Heaven works upon the spirit by truth and righteousness and peace, and thus transforms institutions, permeates society from the ground of the heart, modifies the relations between the members of a household, and transfigures those between a ruler and his subjects, between the master and his slaves, between labor and capital, and between man and man. Whenever it is triumphant, whenever the lives of kings and their peoples are sanctified by supreme obedience to Christ the King, then war will be impossible, all tyrannies and slaveries will be abolished, all malice and violence of monarchs or mobs will be at an end; then the wolfish and the lamblike nature will be at peace. Then all the means for enforcing the will of one against another will be done away. He will have put down all rule, authority, and power; for <span class="accented">he</span> must reign, and he alone. This kingdom is not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) "from," "out of," this world's methods or resources; does not begin from without and establish itself, or propagate or preserve itself, from the world, which is a rival, and is not to be coerced but drawn to itself. Like the individual disciple, the kingdom may be in the world, but not <span class="accented">of</span> it. Christ proceeded, <span class="cmt_word">If the kingdom that is mine were from this world,</span> which it is not (mark the form of the condition), then, on that Supposition, <span class="cmt_word">would the servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, generally translated "officers") <span class="cmt_word">that are mine fight</span>, with physical force, <span class="cmt_word">in order that I should not be delivered up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to the Jews</span>. The supposition that the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of whom our Lord spoke were "the angels" (as Bengel, Lampe, Stier, and at one time Luthardt, imagined), is distinctly repudiated by the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "<span class="accented">of</span> this present world." If it were the case, as it is not, then would my officers be, not a handful of disciples (whom he generally calls <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but the servants who would be appropriate to my royal mission,  <span class="accented">- then would my servants</span> be busily fighting that I should not be delivered up by the Roman power that is for the moment thrown over me like a shield, to the Jews, who are thirsting for my blood. The loud cry of hatred and vengeance may even at this moment have pierced the interior of the Praetorium, thus giving its force, if not form, to the sentence. Godet thinks our Lord was referring to the crowds who actually gathered round him on Palm Sunday, and not to hypothetical <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; but the force of the condition goes down deeper, and, moreover, such language might have awakened the suspicion that, after all, Jesus <span class="accented">had</span> a political following, if he should choose to evoke it. Observe that this entire severance between "the Jews" and the friends of Christ, which, though occasionally adopted by the evangelist, is not the customary method of our Lord. The moment at which the Savior speaks gives great significance to the phraseology (observe <a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>; the only other occasions on which the Lord used this phrase to denote his own people). <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a> and John 15:22, is logical, not temporal); <span class="accented">i.e. But seeing that it is so - <span class="cmt_word"></span>my kingdom</span>, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">is not from hence</span>.

Here Pilate flashes out with haughty rebuke. He had satisfied himself that Jesus was no political rival; hut, in wonderment and scorn, he would sound a little deeper the mystery of the kingly claim. It is not a judicial inquiry, but a burst of ironical surprise: <span class="accented">So then</span>, <span class="accented">after all</span>, <span class="accented">thou art a King</span>, <span class="accented">even then?</span> wavering between positive and negative reply. Hengstenberg sees neither irony nor scorn in the <span class="accented">obsess</span>, but a certain amount of disturbed equanimity. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Thou sayest it, that I am a King.</span> This mode of affirmation is not found in classical Greek or the LXX., but occurs in the New Testament, and in the synoptists also it is given as the great answer of Jesus. Some have translated the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as "for" or "because," and added "well" and "rightly" to the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus: <span class="accented">Thou sayest well</span>, <span class="accented">for I am a King</span>. Hengstenberg and Lampe separate this declaration from what follows, which they interpret exclusively of the prophetic office of Jesus: but the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points backwards as well as forwards, and our Lord accepts that which he proceeds to explain as his royal functions. Westcott, however, says that Jesus neither accepts nor rejects the title of King, but simply reiterates Pilate's words, "Thou sayest that I am a King; I will proceed to explain what I mean by my royal mission." Seeing, however, that our Lord had already implicitly avowed his kingly state, it is far better to discern in the reply an acknowledgment of the inference which Pilate had scornfully drawn (see parallel method of answering the question, "Art thou the Son of God?" <a href="../../par/luke/22-70.htm">Luke 22:70</a>, "Ye say that I am;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> compared with <a href="../../par/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>). This is the "good confession" to which St. Paul referred (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>). This is the assumption, before the tribunal of the whole world, that he was and would forever remain its true King. <span class="cmt_word">To this end have I been born</span>. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is an important admission of his true humanity, which Keim and others are unwilling to find in the Fourth Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And to this end have I come into the world.</span> These words are not tautological. In the first clause he asserts his birth as a man, in the second he refers to the state of being which preceded his incarnation (cf. here <a href="../../par/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>, note), out of which he came, and to which he is now returning. The being "born" of woman is one fact, the "coming into this world" is another which he makes antithetical to his return to the Father. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, present perfect, being used instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and implies that his "coming is permanent in its effects, and not simply a past historic fact" (Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">In order that I might bear witness unto the truth.</span> This is his supreme claim. There is an absolute reality. God's way of thinking about things is the closest approximation we can make to the concept of "truth <span class="accented">per se</span>." In this is comprehended all the reality of the Divine nature and character; all that the eternal God thinks concerning man and the laws which have been given him, and concerning the failure of man to realize God's idea of what he ought to have been; all the absolute fact, just as it really is, of man's peril and his prospects, the actual relations between body and spirit, between the individual and the community; all man's positive need of redemption; all the deep mystery of Christ's own Person and work. These constitute the mighty realm of things, beings, duties, and prospects, which we call truth. Jesus said he had been born and had come into the world in order to bear witness to truth. From John the Baptist's standpoint, that prophet bore witness concerning the <span class="accented">light</span> (<a href="../../par/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8</a>), and, according to the range of his vision, he too (<a href="../../par/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>) bore "witness to the truth" (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. so far as he knew it) of the Christ. Our Lord now solemnly declares that he himself came to bear witness to THE TRUTH in all its amplitude. Hengstenberg sees in these words simply a reference here to the <span class="accented">prophetic</span> office of Christ; but the next clause shows that our Lord is actually defining by this claim the extent of the <span class="accented">kingdom</span> that is "not from hence" or from this world as its origin. <span class="cmt_word">Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice</span>. To "hear the voice" is to obey as a supreme authority (<a href="../../par/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8, 16, 27</a>), and the phrase shows how widely the thought ranges. Every mind open to the influence of truth, every one who is set against the unrealities of mere opinion or tradition, who derives life and joy from the realm of reality, every one who therefore knows how different he might be, how much he needs, who is "of God," as the Source and Beginning and Ground of all things. Compare here the remarkable parallel to this sentiment, John rift. 47; and also the words of the high-priestly prayer, "All thine are mine, and mine are thine," and "Those whom thou hast given me are thine; thine they were, and thou gavest them me." The same large embrace of human souls is conspicuous here, <span class="accented">Every one that is of the truth</span> heareth the voice of Christ, and will accept his authority as final and supreme. The sublime witness to the truth which he had been bearing, in this manifestation of the Name of the Father, would make the voice of Jesus the imperial and august authority for all who fell how much they needed truth. The Sanhedrists said that "truth is the seal of God," and they played upon the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> or "truth," by making it equivalent to the first and middle and last of all things, seeing that <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x20;&#x5d0;</span>, are the first, middle, and last of the letters of the alphabet 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a></div><div class="verse">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault <i>at all</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth</span>? The aphorism of Lord Bacon, "'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and did not wait for an answer," scarcely represents the reality oft-he case. Pilate was not scornfully jesting with a metaphysical problem, nor professing himself hopelessly baffled in search for it. The language was not the utterance of irrepressible homage to his mysterious Prisoner, or heartfelt sympathy with him. For on this supposition why did he not wait for some more words of strange unearthly wisdom? Nor does he go so far in his skepticism as Pliny the Eider did when he said, "that there is only one thing certain, viz. that there is nothing certain;" but as a man of the world having to do with Roman authority or intrigue and Jewish fanaticism, Pilate despised earnestness and zeal, and was utterly unable to believe in the existence of a world or region where any higher reality than force prevailed. But the governor was now, with his narrow range of thought, strongly convinced that Jesus was utterly innocent of the charge brought against him. The unanswered question is equivalent to this - What has truth to do with kingship? What has the vague shadowy region over which this poor king reigns to do with plots against Caesar? He saw enough to induce him to break off the interview within the Praetorium, and he proceeded, though vainly, to deliver a verdict on the case. <span class="cmt_word">When he had said this, he went out to the Jews, and said, I find no crime in him.</span> Here, however, must be introduced the scenes described by Matthew, Mark, and especially by Luke - scenes of loud and angry dispute and renewed and fierce accusation (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4-12</a>). In all three accounts, after the admission that he was King of the Jews, the loud, fierce accusations followed in which our Lord, notwithstanding the repeated summons of Pilate, "answered nothing." At this the governor marveled greatly (Matthew and Mark). It is not impossible that the first question which Pilate put to him <span class="accented">within</span> the Praetorium was renewed and laconically answered with the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as before I but all the wild roar of the chief priests and people could extract nothing more. This silence in face of the accusation of the mob astonished Pilate, and made him more than ever convinced of the innocence of his Prisoner. B. Weiss shows conclusively how much light this interview with Pilate throws on the synoptic narrative; that, in fact, Pilate's whole conduct is only explicable on the supposition that he had received cogent reasons to disarm all political mistrust (see 'Life of Jesus,' vol. 3. pp. 348, 349). Westcott says, "It is of great interest to compare this confession before Pilate with the corresponding confession before the high priest (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>). The one addressed to the Jews is in the language of prophecy, the other addressed to a Roman appeals to the verdict of universal conscience. The one speaks of a future manifestation of <span class="accented">glory</span>, the other of a present manifestation of <span class="accented">truth</span>."

Before the scene which John here introduces with a but - as though it followed immediately upon the utterance of a verdict of acquittal  - Luke tells us that casual reference was made to the circumstance that Jesus was a Galilaean, and was in Herod's jurisdiction. Eager to quit himself' of a troublesome presence and business, Pilate caught at the expedient of sending Jesus at once to the court of Herod (<a href="../../par/luke/23-6.htm">Luke 23:6-12</a>). This issuing in no result except in fresh and hideous mockery of the King of kings, and in a renewed protestation of his innocence and harmlessness, so far as the Roman Pilate or the Herodian tetrarch could discover, Pilate offered to scourge the Son of God, and release him. The utter meanness and cowardice of his offer to add ignominious pain and insult to the brutal mockeries of Herod and his soldiers, brands Pilate with eternal shame. As soon as the word "release" broke upon their ears, there was a reminder from the people that Pilate should follow at the feast the custom for some time in vogue, of releasing a prisoner. Now, there was a notorious criminal, who had stirred up a bloody insurrection in the city, one which had resulted in murder. He <span class="accented">may</span> have been popular among the vehement anti-imperial party for some seditious proceedings against constituted authorities; he may, in fact, really have been guilty of the very charge brought wickedly against the holy Jesus. This is only conjecture. But there he stood - Barabbas, and, according to some manuscripts, "Jesus" also by name, "Son of the Father," but a violent man, a <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, statue with crime, whether he were a Gaulonite or not. The notion of releasing Barabbas, in accordance with a time honored custom, did, according to Luke, originate first of all with some of the people; and this apparent difference between the synoptic narrative and John's is represented and referred to in this Gospel by the introduction of a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Ver. 40). For although John does not mention the first attempt to secure the safety of Barabbas, he implied that the infernal shout, "Not this Man, but Barabbas!" had already burst upon his ears, and was repeated so soon as Pilate had exclaimed, as John briefly reports, <span class="cmt_word">Ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the Passover</span> (or, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6</a>). We know nothing of the origin of this "custom," nor is it elsewhere referred to. The two classes into which critics are divided about the "day of our Lord's death," here take opposite views as to the meaning of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span>. The one class press the fact that the Paschal meal must be over, and that this must have been the first day of unleavened bread, in order to justify this expression; the other critics urge that since the feast had not commenced, Pilate was prepared to grant release in time for Barabbas to take his place with his friends in all the national ceremonies. The phrase, according to Meyer and others, is so indefinite that it may most certainly belong to both the 14th and 15th days of Nisan, and no conclusive argument can, from its use, be drawn in favor of <span class="accented">either</span> day. <span class="cmt_word">Will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? Again therefore they cried all, Not this Man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> Possibly Pilate wished to find out whether among the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there were any sympathizers with Jesus, who might be gratified at the expense of the hated priests; for he "knew that by reason of envy they had delivered up Jesus to him." He wished to set the multitude and the priesthood at variance, and to save Jesus through their mutual recriminations. He would have made a diversion in favor of his Prisoner. He adroitly suspected that some of the surging crowd might have been the friends or accomplices of Jesus, and he would have been gratified to free himself from the <span class="accented">responsibility</span> of slaying an innocent man. The phraseology of Mark suggests that Pilate would have been justified in such a conjecture, for a momentary pause occurred. There were some symptoms of wavering in the crowd. But the suggestions of the chief priests passed to the people. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20</a>) <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> chief priests and elders persuaded (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) the multitudes that they should demand Barabbas, and destroy <span class="accented">Jesus</span>." <span class="accented">They</span> needed some persuasion, then: but, alas! they yielded to it. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11</a>) is still more explicit: "The chief priests stirred up the people(<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), in order that he might release Barabbas unto them." The double phrase sets forth, in vivid touches, the eager circulation to and fro among the crowds of the hot- headed and malignant priests and elders, who thus secured, not without some difficulty, a popular confirmation of their malignant scheme. "NOT THIS MAN, BUT BARABBAS!" was the repeated cry of a stupefied crowd. The memory of all the gracious words and life-giving actions of Jesus did not subdue the raging passion of their lust; they could neither see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts. The light that was in them was darkened. They preferred that a murderer should be granted to them. "Not this Man, but Barabbas!" is their verdict. Human power and popular feeling and corporate conscience reached the bottomless abyss of degradation. Jerusalem that killed the prophets would have none of him. Even human nature itself must bear the shame which by this cry for vengeance against goodness was branded upon its brow for ever. Through this daemonic hatred of the noblest and the best, manifested by the world, the world is itself condemned. "Who is he," said John afterwards, "that overcometh the world? Even he who believeth that Jesus is the Son of God." The world has made its Sesostris, its Tiberius, its Nero, its Antinous, into sons of God; the world has ever cried, "<span class="accented">Not</span> this Man" - not Jesus of Nazareth - but "<span class="accented">Jesus</span> Barabbas is son of God." It will find out its mistake too late. The synoptic narrative (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-12.htm">Mark 15:12-14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-20.htm">Luke 23:20-23</a>) had already made the Church familiar with other details more or less connected with this incident, and which preceded the final sentence. John, who followed his Master as closely as possible, was acquainted with some interesting facts, full of suggestion, which throw additional light upon the conduct of Pilate, and bring forth some sublime traits in the character and bearing of our Lord. From the synoptists we learn that Pilate struggled for some considerable time to get his own way, and he remonstrated repeatedly with the people concerning their choice of Barabbas, the murderer and brigand, and their refusal to recall their malignant deliverance of Jesus to him as a malefactor. The bare idea that this gentle, silent, magnanimous Sufferer, bereft of his friends, mocked by Herod, deserted by his disciples, should have the faintest shadow of a claim to sovereignty in the only sense in which Pilate could understand such an idea, revolted his common sense. The message from his wife (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>) had furthermore excited his semi-superstitious fears, and he maundered in a feeble fashion, "What shall I do with Jesus that is called Christ?" -"with him whom ye say is (accused of being) King of the Jews?" and for the first time the ominous and terrible cry is returned, "CRUCIFY HIM!" They do not ask that he be speared or beheaded, or treated like a convicted aspirant or usurper; nay, they will not be pacified until the doom of a common malefactor, the shameful death of a criminal slave, is meted out to him. Pilate is amazed, and even horrified, by the intensity of their spite and the cruelty of their hatred. Once and again Pilate said, "Why, what evil has he done? I found in him no proved occasion of any kind of death." The tumult was rising every moment, and Pilate would have been glad to compromise the matter by sending Barabbas to the cross; and before he took the course dictated by the angry mob, he washed his hands in a basin of water, and proclaimed the fact that he had, and would take, no responsibility for the judicial murder to which they would hound him. "I am guiltless of the blood of this Man: see you to it" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24, 25</a>). Many commentators refer this proceeding of Pilate to the moment when he finally uttered the cursed verdict: <span class="accented">Ibis ad crucem</span>. Matthew's account is much more concise at this point than John's. Heathen writers had repeatedly scoffed at the notion of water washing away the guilt of blood. We can hardly suppose that Pilate meant more than a disdainful repudiation of any sympathy with the infuriated crowd (see Steinmeyer). This act, instead of appeasing, served to madden the fury of the populace, who shouted in bitter earnest, "<span class="accented">His</span> blood be upon <span class="accented">us</span>, and upon our children" -<span class="accented">a</span> sentence of their own, which rankled in their memories, and came back a few months afterwards with grim earnestness (<a href="../../par/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>). "<span class="accented">Then</span>," says St. Matthew, "Pilate released Barabbas to them." To do this, the governor would return to the Praetorinm, and Jesus was thus once more face to face with him. Probably the gorgeous robe which Herod had thrown over his fettered limbs had been taken from him; and then Pilate, bewildered, weak, with some ulterior motive of staving off the madness of the Jews, and satiating their inhuman thirst for blood, adopted another expedient.  <p> <p>

The force of the "therefore" may be seen in the foregoing observations (see especially <a href="../../par/luke/23-23.htm">Luke 23:23-25</a>). He obviously fancied that the sight of their Victim's utter humiliation, his reduction to the lowest possible position, would sate their burning rage. Scourging was the ordinary preliminary of crucifixion, and it might be regarded as Pilate's verdict, or the conclusion of the whole matter. Roman and Greek historians confirm the custom (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 5:11.1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:14. 9; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-33.htm">Luke 18:33</a>) of scourging before crucifixion. It may have had a twofold motive - one to glut the desire of inflicting physical torment and ignominy, and another allied to the offer of anodyne, to hasten the final sufferings of the cross. But the governor clearly thought that he might, by first humoring the populace, in releasing Barabbas from his confinement, and then reducing to a political absurdity the charge of treason against Caesar, save the suffering Prisoner from further wrong. The morbid suggestion of a mind accustomed to gladiatorial shows, and to the sudden changes of feeling which ran through the amphitheatres at the sight of blood, not only reveals the incapacity of Pilate to understand the difference between right and wrong, but proves that he had not sounded the depth of Jewish fanaticism, nor understood the people he had been ordered to coerce. John uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, a purely Greek word. Matthew and Mark, who refer to the scourging which preceded Christ's being led to Calvary, use another official and technical word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (identifiable with the Latin word flagellans). This does not require us to believe in two scourgings. Matthew and Mark simply refer to the scourging, which had been arbitrarily and informally inflicted, as John informs us, before the condemnation was pronounced. The Roman punishment flagellis inflicted hideous torture. "It was executed upon slaves with thin elm rods or straps having leaden balls or sharply pointed bones attached, and was delivered on the bent, bare, and tense back." The victim was fastened to a pillar for the-purpose, the like to which has actually been found by Sir C. Warren in a subterranean cavern, on the site of what Mr. Ferguson regards as the Tower of Antonia (Westcott). The flagellation usually brought blood with the first stroke, and reduced the back to a fearful state of raw and quivering flesh. Strong men often succumbed under it, while the indignity of such a proceeding in this case must have cut far deeper into the awful sanctuary of the Sufferer's soul.

The "gorgeous robe" which  had been put upon Jesus by Herod had been probably taken' from him before he was brought the second time into the Praetorium, and necessarily before his scourging.  Now, though it is called a "purple robe" by John, it was probably a cast-off toga of the Herodian court, in all likelihood it was the same garment which was thrown again around his fettered limbs, his bowed and bleeding form. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns; in imitation of the victor's wreath at a "triumph," rather than the coronet or diadem of a king. The material is believed by Winer, Hug, Luthardt, and Godet to be the Lycium spinosum, often found at Jerusalem, not the acanthus, whose leaves decorate our Corinthian columns. It is of flexible stem, and would be soon woven into a wreath, the spikes of which, when it was placed around that majestic head, would be driven into the flesh, and produce great agony.

They did a sham obeisance to him, having elected him, as Roman guards often did, an "imperator" on the field of battle. The offerings which they presented to him were not the kiss of homage, but <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">They kept on offering him blows on the face,</span> strokes with the hand or with rods (cf. <a href="../../par/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a>, note). Hengstenberg, recalling here (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>) that they put a reed in his hand, symbol of a scepter, supposes that he refused to hold it, in consequence of which they took it from him, and smote him with it. The awful indignity was a wondrous prophecy. Nay, from that very hour he began to reign. That crown of thorns has been more lasting than any royal diadem. Those cruel insults have been the title-deeds of his imperial sway, by which he has mastered the nations. He was wounded, bruised, for the iniquities of us all. The representatives of the outside world thus share expressly in the shame and ban by which the Hebrew theocracy is crushed, and the prince of this world is judged. "They know not what they do;" but Jew and Roman are guilty before God.

Pilate rims renews and varies his testimony to the character of the Holy One! He makes another fruitless appeal to the humanity and justice of the maddened mob. But what a revelation of Pilate's own weakness and shame! He can find no fault, but has connived at, nay, ordered, the worst part of this atrocious punishment. Keim would have us think that Pilate's anxiety to save a Jew is a mere invention made by the second-century fabricator. There is however, nothing incompatible with a Roman official's anxiety not to commit a judicial murder, for his own sake, and perhaps for the honor of his order. The hypothesis is irrational that the entire representation of Pilate's desire to screen or save Jesus from the malice of the Jews was a device of the author, due to his Gentile nationality and proclivities, anxious to put even the Roman officials in the best possible light. Surely Christians had no temptation to mitigate their judgments upon Rome at the time of the persecution under Marcus Antoninus. Thoma, like Strauss, finds the basis of the representation in the prophetic types of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. and <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>.

As Caiaphas did not know the enormous significance of his own dictum (<a href="../../par/john/11-50.htm">John 11:50</a>), so Pilate, from his purely secular position, did not appreciate the world-wide meaning of his own words. He did not know that he had at his side the Man of men, the perfect veritable Man, the unattainable Ideal of all humanity realized. He did not anticipate that that crown of thorns, that robe of simulated royalty, that sign of bloody agony, and these insults borne with sublime patience and ineffable love, were even then lifting Jesus to the throne of eternal memory and universal dominion; nor how his own words would be enshrined in art, and continue to the end of time a crystallization of the deepest emotion of the Church of God. The hymn of Gerhard expresses in thrilling tones the universal and perpetual feeling of all Christians- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"O Haupt veil Blur und Wunden<br />Voll schwerz und yeller Hohn!<br />O Haupt zum Sport gebunden<br />Mit ether Dornerkon!"</span> But the appeal to humanity was vain, and Pilate's momentary sentiment failed of its end.

Go, do your deed of blood by your own hands, take all the responsibility; for I find no crime in him. Pilate thus derides their powerlessness, and repeats his verdict of acquittal (see <a href="../../par/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>). At this moment the so-called trial might have ended, so far as Pilate was concerned, with a frank and immediate release. It would seem as though the governor had decided, and there could be no more discussion. But -

It might have met with the kind of reception which Gallio gave to the accusers of Sosthenes in the Corinthian court. He might have driven them at point of spear or whip from the judgment-seat. "The Jews' here mentioned, rather than "the chief priests and officers" of the previous verse, for the multitude - by some other spokesmen than they - exclaim, <span class="cmt_word">We have a law, and according to that</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">law</span> <span class="cmt_word">he ought to die</span>; whatever you may have made of the charge of political treason. In full session of our Sanhedrin, <span class="cmt_word">he made himself</span>, represented himself, as something more than Caesar, nay, more than man, as <span class="cmt_word">Son of God</span>. "King of Jews" was a usurpation of the Messianic dignity; but he had claimed, in their very hearing, to be more than a national leader. He raised himself to the position of being "Jehovah's King upon his holy hill," to whom Jehovah had sworn, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;" "Son of God" as well as "King of Israel." Pilate would not and could not understand this strange "testimony to the truth;" and the people were now in a more angry and excited state than ever, and appealed to the law of their own code (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), which denounced death upon the blasphemer. This charge was just unless the claim was true. If Christ had not been to his own inmost consciousness what he said he was, the Sanhedrin was in the right; and, according to law, he was guilty of death. It is here vastly interesting to see another indication of relation between the synoptic narrative and the Fourth Gospel. Though John passed ever the scenes before the Sanhedrin, and the circumstance that Christ had been actually there doomed because he had made there no secret of his Divine claims, and declared himself to be a king in a higher sense than Pilate dreamed; yet John has given clear proof that he was well aware of the confession, and records the still more striking tact that this special claim of supreme prerogative actually came to the ears and before the judgment-seat of Rome.

Superstition goes hand in hand with skepticism. Instead of this being (as Keim says) contrary to psychologic laws, the history of skepticism is constantly presenting the same features (cf. Herod Antipas the Sadducee, who would dogmatically have repudiated the idea of resurrection, crying out concerning Jesus, "It is John the Baptist, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead," etc.). We need not suppose that Pilate was suddenly affected by the truth of Jewish monotheism; but he may readily have believed that the wondrous Being before him was enshrouded in a mystery of supernatural portent and pretension that he could not fathom, and before which he trembled. The idea of Divine energy enshrined in and wielded by human beings was not altogether foreign to heathen thought - and one centurion, at least, who was probably present on this very occasion, exclaimed that Jesus was a Son of God (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>).

The governor was disturbed, and ready to suspect that he had on his hands some supernatural Being whom no cross could destroy - some mysterious half-human, half-Divine creature, such as filled the popular literature; and, without any spiritual insight on his own side, he enticed Jesus to give him his confidence, and entrust to his keeping some of the secret of his origin, and the source of the bitter antagonism to his claims. There was fear, curiosity, and great desire for his own sake to save the suffering Man from the clutches of his enemies. "Whence art thou? Hast thou indeed made this claim? Best thou call thyself Son of God? that God is thy proper Father; that thou art coming in the glory of heaven; that thou, in thy purple robe and bleeding form, art already seated on thy throne of judgment?" Surely all this was really conveyed by the question, for we cannot suppose that "the Jews" confined themselves to the laconic recital of the charge as here recorded. The silence of Jesus is very impressive, and we, in our ignorance, can only vaguely say what it meant. Very numerous explanations are offered. Luthardt's idea, that Christ would not give an answer which would have the effect of preventing Pilate, in his agitated state, from giving the order for his crucifixion, is stagey and unreal. Moreover, it is bound up with very questionable ethic, and suggests that Jesus is answerable for the awful sin of Pilate, from which, by a word, he might have saved him. We admit that at any moment the Lord could, if he had chosen, have smitten his foes with blindness, or delivered himself from their malice by passing through them (cf. John 12:59). They would all have fallen to the earth if he had glanced at them as he had done upon the Roman guard in Gethsemane upon that very band of men who were now so busy in wiping out the stain of their momentary panic. On other occasions, when his hour of self-deliverance and self-devotion to the Father's will had not arrived, he discomfited his enemies; but now his hour had come, and he did not shrink. All this is true, but it does not account for the refusal to answer a question like this. Doubtless the silence was as expressive as speech, and even less likely to be misunderstood. He could not have denied that he was "Son of God." He could not have affirmed it without leading Pilate to put human and heathen notions into it. But could not he, who is infinite wisdom incarnate, have given an answer which would have avoided both dangers? That, however, is practically what he did effect. The prophetic picture had foretold of him, that "like a sheep before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth;" and the previous silences of Jesus before Annas, and before the false witnesses, before Caiaphas, and Pilate himself, and before Herod, are all governed by the same rule - a refusal to save himself from malignant falsity, or tricky design, or conspicuously lying charges; but when challenged to say whether he was the Christ, whether he was the Son of God, whether he was a King, he gave the answers needed. There was some likeness between the spirit of Herod, Caiaphas, and the false witnesses, and of Pilate's "Whence art thou?" which did not deserve an affirmative answer. The governor, who had scourged and insulted an apparently defenseless man, at the very moment when he was proclaimed innocent, and now was afraid of what he had done, came into the category of the slayers of the silent Lamb. But to the next inquiry, which went down to the depths of his heart, and revealed the utter unspirituality and self-ignorance which needed response, a wondrous reply was given.

"I do not wonder at your silence before that malignant crowd, but to me your refusal to speak is inexplicable." He did not appear to desire genuine information, nor was his conscience touched by reflecting upon the hateful mistake he had made. "The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> bears the emphasis of mortified power, which attempts even then to terrify and entice" (Meyer). Archdeacon Watkins says well, "Pilate is true to the vacillating character which now, as man, trembles before One who may be a being from the other world, and now as Roman governor expects that Being to tremble before him." <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou not that I have authority</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to release thee;</span> <span class="cmt_word">and that I have authority to crucify thee?</span> Pilate scoffingly assumes supreme authority of life and death, He virtually says, "I am the judge; you are the accused criminal. I am your master, and the master of the Jews; you are absolutely in my power." This, then, was another moment of critical and intense interest, and of tremendous temptation from the prince of this world. The destiny of the Church, of Christianity, and of the world might seem to be trembling in the balance. A single glance, a single word of admission or pleading, a gesture of deference, or merely human confidence, or gentle flattery, to say nothing of the exercise of the very power by which the Lord had erewhile spell-bound his captors, or paralyzed the arms which meant to stone him, and the whole history of the world (judged from human and historical standpoints) would have been utterly different. But the same Christ who would not accept the help of daemons, nor ascend from the mountain of Transfiguration to his native and primeval home, nor at any time work a miracle for the supply of his merely personal need, uttered the memorable words - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power <i>at all</i> against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wouldst not have</span> <span class="cmt_word">authority against me of any kind,</span> either judicial or actual, or both combined: thou wouldst hold no judicial position which I or others could recognize, nor wouldst thou have the faintest power to proceed against me unless, etc. Here our Lord points to the great doctrine which Paul afterwards expressed (<a href="../../par/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) about the powers that be, and hints that every circumstance and event which led to Pilate's occupancy of that judgment-seat, or which in recent times had delivered up the people of the Lord to the authority of Rome, and prepared for the occupancy of the Praetorium by Pontius Pilate himself, was altogether beyond the range of his judge's spontaneity and competency. <span class="cmt_word">Unless it were given thee from above</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He does not say, "from my Father," or "from God" - phrases which would have been incomprehensible to a skeptical heathen; but "from above," from that Divine providential source of all power which rules all. The Lord thus implies the Divine legitimation of the judicial rank of Pilate; and the fact that his continuous occupancy of it was a talent revocable in a moment by the hand that gave it, and that all the exercise of his so-called <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was dependent on his supreme will. <span class="cmt_word">For this cause he that delivered</span> <span class="cmt_word">me up to thee.</span> Though Judas is continually described as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64-71</a>), yet we have already seen that the act of Judas had been endorsed by the people, and by the Sanhedrin, who now by their highest official representative had "delivered" him up to Pilate (<a href="../../par/john/18-35.htm">John 18:35</a>, note), betrayed him with murderous intention to the power which could not merely excommunicate, but could kill by judicial process. Our Lord may either refer to Caiaphas (Bengel, Meyer, Luthardt) or to the Sanhedrin and people as a whole (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Hath greater sin</span>. "Because the initiative has been taken by him, and irrespective of thee; because thy power, such as it is over me, is a Divine arrangement, made irrespective of thy will; and the whole of this proceeding has been forced upon thee against thy better  judgment." Nevertheless, he implies that Pilate has sinned: he was exercising his seeming judicial rights irrespective of justice. He had declared Jesus to be free from blame or charge in open court, but he had nevertheless submitted the innocent Sufferer to the utmost wrong; but he that delivered Christ-to Pilate had done so out of willful ignorance, and was sinning against light and knowledge. Caiaphas might have recognized Christ's true Messiahship, and accepted his true claims, and bowed before him as the Sent of God, as the Son of the Blessed; but instead of this he had violated the law, and sacrificed the hope and spiritual independence of his own people, out of deference to the sacrosanct honors of his own order. Pilate's consciousness of independence is rebuked, and his conscience appealed to, and the Lord, in this last word to his judge, claims to be his Suzerain, and awards to him his share of blame. Pilate said to the Jews, "I find no fault in him;" Jesus said to Pilate, "Thou hast committed a great sin, though there is another God-given <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which is more seriously and culpably trifled with than thine is: he that delivered me to thee hath committed a greater."

We are not told by what means, and we have no right to introduce the additional notion of "peremptorily," or "the more," but that he made some further steps in the direction of resistance to the will of "the Jews." Baur and others think that the author is, from doctrinal grounds by mere fabrication, emphasizing the hostility of the Jews, and prolonging the agony of a vain attempt. Every one of these vivid touches impresses us with the unintentional indication of the eye-witness. Probably the governor proceeded to give the order of release; beckoned his body-guard to remove our Lord to a place of safety, and took some obvious steps to screen him from the malice and envy of his tormentors. <span class="cmt_word">But the Jews</span>, catching sight of the process, and imagining some maneuver to baulk them of their prey, revealed a spirit that has sometimes, but rarely, disgraced humanity: they dropped their religious plea, they smothered their affected loyalty for their ancient Law, and, having no further charge to bring against Jesus, hid their most intense hatred of Roman rule by assuming the mask of loyal subjection to Tiberius and to the majesty of the Caesar. They endeavored to work upon the fears of Pilate, who knew perfectly well that his position and life were at jeopardy if the matter stood as they pretended. With unscrupulous abandonment of all their patriotic boasts, the men who hated Rome and were perpetually plotting against the imperial power, <span class="cmt_word">exclaimed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>,  shouted with harsh loud yells of bitter hate, that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> rang for half a century in the ears of the loved and faithful disciple), <span class="cmt_word">If thou release this Man, thou art not Caesar's friend</span>. The friendship and confidence of Caesar was the title in their hearts to an unresting hatred and loathing; yet they are cunning enough to know that Tiberius was jealous of his own authority, and no charge was so fatal to a Roman procurator as crimen majestatis (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 3:38). Amiens Caesaris was a title of honor given to provincial governors, and sometimes to allies of the Caesar; but (as Alford, Meyer, and Westcott think) on this occasion it was used in wider sense, and was capable of a mere deadly emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">Every one who maketh himself</span> <span class="cmt_word">a king speaketh against</span> (declares himself opposed to, rebels against) <span class="cmt_word">Caesar</span>. As if that was likely to distress these maddened fanatics; and as if the very charge had not been already deliberately laughed to scorn by both Herod and Pilate. There was a Man who said he was a King, and Pilate was guilty of misprision of treason. Pilate's political history aggravated his fears. His relations with the emperor were not satisfactory (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:03. 1,2; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:09. 2-4; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1</a>), and his knowledge of the power of these Jews to renew partisan and patriotic charges against him was now a very serious danger.

Moreover, the mockery was the act of the soldiery and of Herod's men of war, not of Pilate). It is remarkable, as Dr. James Drummond (Theological Review, 1877) points out, that Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1:35) apparently refers to this supposed transitive usage of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> in this very connection by John, by the words, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>.

This was probably an elevated and fixed platform overlooking the temple-courts, or joining the Castle of Antonia with the temple.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a></div><div class="verse">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it was the preparation of the Passover</span>. Once more the question of the discrepancy between the Johannine and synoptic implication of the day of our Lord's death reappears. This statement is claimed eagerly by both classes of critics. Hengstenberg, M'Clellan, Lange, Schaff, etc., all urge that the word "preparation" is simply the "Friday" before the sabbath - "the eve of the sabbath," and that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span> is added in the broad Johannine sense of the entire Paschal festival, and means the "Friday" of the Passover week, and that thus John only confirms the synoptic narrative that the Passover had been sacrificed on the previous evening. To this it is replied, by Meyer, Godet, Westcott, Farrar, etc., that this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> belongs to a much later period, and here it is used in the sense of the "preparation" for the Paschal meal, without interfering with the fact afterwards mentioned, that it was the pro-sabbaton, the day before the sabbath; the first day of unleavened bread coinciding with the ordinary weekly sabbath. The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span> here would have no meaning for a reader, who had not learned this technical and later patristic usage. Why should not John, on that understanding, have simply used the word in the sense which the synoptists give to it, as equivalent to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>? [There is another difficulty in the former interpretation: if our Lord was crucified on the first day of unleavened bread and after the Paschal meal, there would be a second preparation of the Passover on that day week, so that John could not have spoken of it with the precision which he used (see notes on John 13:1; 18:28).] The balance of argument, so far as John is concerned, is in favor of the Passover meat being still in prospect, and the statement is made to call attention to the fact that, as St. Paul said, "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us." Thus doubtless the blindness of the Jews is aggravated, and the typical and symbolic meaning of the correspondence between the ritual and its antitype emphasized. Another serious perplexity occurs<span class="cmt_word">. It was about the sixth hour</span>. This is in manifest opposition with Mark's statement (<a href="../../par/mark/15-25.htm">Mark 15:25</a>) that the Crucifixion took place at the third hour, and with all three of the synoptists, that the supernatural darkness overspread Jerusalem from the sixth to the ninth hour. This is represented as taking place after our Lord had been hanging for some time upon the cross. Some relief to this great difficulty of horology is found in the slight modification of the text from <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> of T.R. to <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, which may suffer the reading of Lange ("es war gegen die"), "it was going on towards the sixth hour" - the third hour, 9 a.m., was passed, and it was moving on to midday. Westcott, in an elaborate note on John's measurement of time, endeavors to prove that he always uses the Roman system of measure from midnight to midday, instead of the Oriental method of measurement from sunrise to sunset, and that he meant by the sixth hour 6 a.m., not 12 midday. But if this is possible, the perplexity is rather increased than diminished. It is difficult to imagine that this stage of the proceedings could have been reached by six o'clock a.m., and that three hours still followed before the Lord was crucified. M'Clellan hotly espouses this interpretation, and, against Farrar, maintains that the Romans did adopt this computation, by quotations from Censorinus ('De Die Nat.,' 23.), Pithy ('Nat. Hist.,' 2:77), Aulus Gellius, and Maerobius; and he reminds his readers that John wrote in Ephesus, and proves that there was an Asiatic computation of time which corresponded with the Roman, and that there is abundant time before 6 a.m. for all that is needed to have taken place. This is the interpretation of Townson ('Discourses on the Four Gospels'), and it is espoused by Cresswell, Wieseler, Ewald, Westcott, Moulton. Coder, however, gives strong proof, on <a href="../../par/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a>, that the Greeks of Asia Minor were familiar with the Jewish reckoning from sunrise to sunset (see notes on John 1:39; 4:6; 11:9). Eusebius supposed an alteration of the text of John, converting <span class="greek">&#x393;</span>  =  3 into <span class="greek">&#962;</span>  =  6. It is strange that no manuscripts have revealed the fact, though the third correcter of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and the supplement to D suggest this early solution of the difficulty. Eusebius was followed by Ammonius and Severus of Antioch. Beza, Bengel, and Alford with hesitation accept this conclusion. Luthardt, Farrar, and Schaff seem inclined to think that this may be the explanation, unless the <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> be used with great latitude of meaning, and that what is really intended was that it was moving on to midday. The nine o'clock had been passed. Luthardt is dissatisfied with every explanation, not simply because it is inconsistent with the synoptic narrative, but because it is incompatible with John's own reckoning. Hengstenberg thought that the division of the day into four periods of three hours each is far older than either the Talmud or Maimonides (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-38.htm">Luke 12:38</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-3.htm">Matthew 20:3, 4</a>), and that the synoptic narrative reckoned by the terminus a quo, which, taken literally, would be too early for the act of crucifixion, and that John's reckoning points to the terminus ad quem, which, taken literally, would be too late. M'Clellan thinks this "outrageous!" though Andrewes, Lewin, Ellicott, and Lange practically adopt it. Augustine says, "At the third hour (Mark) he was crucified by the tongues of the Jews, at the sixth hour (John) by the hands of the soldiers." Da Costa suggested that the sixth hour was reckoned backward from 3 p.m., the commencement of the preparation. Mark, by using the aorist, cannot have intended to convey that the whole process of crucifixion, commencing with the scourging, including the procession to Golgotha, and the last scene of all, was included in the verb. (Hesychius argued this view at length, saying that Mark refers to the verdict of Pilate, and John to the nailing to the cross.) At the hour, thus indicated by a term which cannot be finally interpreted, Pilate, trembling with rage and impotent fury, endeavored to fling at the head of the haughty priesthood another maddening taunt, and yet with a flash of inward conviction which, after all, staggered him: he pointed once more to the sublime Sufferer, bleeding from his wounds and crowned with thorns, having every mark upon him of their insulting cruelty and insensate hate, wearing the mock and cruel habiliments of royalty, and <span class="cmt_word">he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King</span>! There is the King whom you have crowned, and whose claim lies altogether beyond your ken. Wavering between the favor of Tiberius and the claims of justice, remembering that Sejanus, to whom he had personally owed his own appointment, had already been a victim to the jealousy of their common master, he yet cannot suppress the bitter taunt involved in <span class="greek">&#x1f3c;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>

This wrung forth from them a cry which expressed the uttermost and basest abandonment of all their proud boasts, a heartless and fateful acknowledgment of their servility and dependence. <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar</span>! Our Messianic hope is dead, our national independence is at an end, our witness as a people to truth, our listening to the voice which would have gathered us together, are over. As before they had shouted, "Not this Man, but Barabbas!" so now, "Not the Lord of glory, but the damon lord of Rome; not this King of kings, but Tiberius Augustus et Dominus sacratissimus noster." In renouncing Christ by the lips of their chief priests, they put themselves under the power of the prince of this world, and terribly they answered for their crime. "They elected Caesar to be their king; by Caesar they were destroyed" (Lampe). Their theocracy fell by their mad rage against the perfect embodiment of the highest righteousness and purest love. "The kingdom of God, by the confession of its rulers, has become the kingdom of this world." How terribly symptomatic of the perpetual resistance of his claims by all those who deliberately reject his authority! "We have no king but fashion! .... We have no king but mammon!" "We have no king but the leader of our clique!" "We have no king but pleasure!" "We have no king but our royal selves!"  - are voices not infrequently heard even now. This cry was too much for Pilate; he wavered, paltered with justice, vented his insolence and pride, knew better and did the thing which he felt to be base. "He who had often prostituted justice was now utterly unable to achieve the one act of justice which he desired. He who had so often murdered pity was now forbidden to taste the sweetness of a pity for which he longed" (Farrar). <span class="cmt_word">Then therefore he delivered him to them, in order that he might be crucified.</span> "IBIS AD CRUCEM. I MILES EXPEDI CRUCEM," were the awful words in which he would deliver his judgment and secure an everlasting execration. He delivered up Jesus unto them; for they, though not the positive hands by which the foul deed was done, were the sole inciting causes of the act. Luke, as well as John, involves this idea, and Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>) says, "Ye slew him, crucifying him by the hands of lawless men," and (<a href="../../par/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>) "Ye killed the Prince of Life." Yet they were profoundly anxious for his death by Roman crucifixion, not only because thus they were impelled to fulfill the great prophecy and confirm the words of the blessed Lord himself, but because they wished to stamp out in disgrace and shame all his claims; because they wished that the supreme court, the heathen and corrupting power, should dash down to earth and defile this idol of some of the people and even some of their own number; because they wished to deliver themselves from the responsibility of the act, and to avoid being called to give an account to Rome of their judicial murder; and in the act itself they wished to have a Roman guard to prevent an escape and quell an emeute. The school of T&uuml;bingen endeavor to invalidate the Johannine portraiture of Pilate, and to ascribe its fictitious creation in the second century to a desire then rampant, to charge upon the Jews all the blame of the act, and to exhibit Pilate as a symbol of the sympathy which the Gentile world was extending to Christianity and the Church. The persecutions which prevailed from the days of Nero, Domitian, and Trajan, to those of the Antonines, rebuke such a supposition. Moreover, the synoptic narrative is equally explicit with St. John in setting forth the sympathy of Pilate, or rather his desire to release Jesus (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a> and 18, 17-23, 24; <a href="../../par/mark/15-8.htm">Mark 15:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-13.htm">Luke 23:13-22</a>). Luke tells us that Peter charges the guilt of the Crucifixion upon the Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/james/5-6.htm">James 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>). The explanation of Pilate's conduct and of his final despicable act is given only in John's Gospel; and even Reuss admits that we have in John "the true key of the problem" (see Coder, in loc., vol. 3. pp. 260-263).

They did not receive him in the fullness of his grace, but they did receive him to inflict the curse and shame and death for which they had plotted and clamored. This powerful suggestion is brought out by the amended text. At this point, when the sacred Sufferer left the Praetorium and was dragged into the rush of the vociferating crowd, the synoptic narrative becomes far fuller in detail. The terrible tragedy in-eludes the disrobing. The bleeding form is once more clothed with his own garments (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-31.htm">Matthew 27:31</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-20.htm">Mark 15:20</a>). It is not necessary to suppose a second scourging (see ver. 1). The circumstance mentioned (<a href="../../par/luke/23-26.htm">Luke 23:26</a> and parallel passages) of Simon of Cyrene made to bear his cross after him, shows how Jesus in his human nature had suffered already. A second scourging (if we judge by all we can gather of such an infliction) would have been followed by immediate death, and would thus have snatched from them the realization of their inhuman purpose. The statement that, <span class="cmt_word">bearing his cross for himself, he went forth</span>, shows that they tried to force him thus in his agony to endure this additional humiliation, and, from his physical exhaustion, were compelled to make use of the expedient described by the synoptists. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/15-22.htm">Mark 15:22</a>) introduces another most suggestive word, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "they carry him" from the place where they compelled (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) Simon to take up his cross, and at least he hints, if he does not express, the terrible fact that they had, by their fell cruelty of all kinds, at length exhausted all the human physical strength of the Sufferer. John's language, though at first sight discrepant with Luke's, really explains it. Luke also describes the wailing of the daughters of Jerusalem, and the sublime self-forgetfulness with which Jesus turned their thoughts from his agony to themselves and their children. Matthew and Mark both relate another scene, which seems as if one gleam of pity had crossed some heart - "They offered him wine, mixed with narcotic gall," to stupefy his senses, and lull his physical agony. He did not put it by "with suicidal hand;" but, as Keble sang - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thou wilt feel all, that thou mayst pity all;<br />And rather wouldst thou wrestle with strong pain<br />Than overcloud thy soul,<br />So clear in agony,<br />Or lose no glimpse of heaven before the time."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Christian Year.'</span>) <span class="cmt_word">He went forth to a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha</span>. "He went forth" from the Praetorium along the Via Dolorosa, wheresoever it was, beyond the city wall (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>, etc., "He suffered without the gate"). Moses had forbidden (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>) capital punishment within the camp (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>). The traditional site of the place is far within the present walls in the north-western quarter of the city, not far from the gate of Damascus; and endless discussions have prevailed with respect to the line of the second city wall, which at that time must either have included or excluded the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. The identification of the site of Golgotha is rendered difficult from the eagerness with which theories have been sustained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ferguson's theory is that Constantine's" Church of the Resurrection" is to be found in the 'dome of the rock' in the temple enclosure! He urges that the tradition was moved thence to the "Church of the Holy Sepulcher" in the eleventh century, when Fatimite kaliphs drove the Christians away, and persecuted the pilgrims to such an extent as to produce the reaction of the Crusades. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The ecclesiastical theory is that the tomb and all the awful and blessed associations are to be reckoned for somewhere within the buildings or ruins of the present church. The difficulties are great; for, instead of being "without the gate," or "nigh the city," it is situated in the heart of the present city, and it is very difficult to imagine or trace any line of wall which could have run in such a way as to exclude the supposed site of the tomb from the city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A modern theory (see 'Survey of Palestine') finds the tomb in the immediate vicinity of Jeremiah's grotto, to the north of the Damascus gate. This site has good claims, from the probability <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that it was the place of public execution; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that the second wall of the city did correspond with the present wall; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> that there are reasons to think that it was built over and concealed from view until comparatively recent years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Warren and Conder give a drawing of the tomb and its arrangement, which sustains the probability that it is the tomb once hallowed by the most stupendous event in the history of the world. Robinson said, "The place was probably upon a great road leading from one of the gates, and such a spot would only be found upon the west or north side of the city, on the roads leading to Joppa or Damascus." The word "Gulgotha" or "Gulgaltha" is the Aramaic (cf. Syriac Gagulta) form of Gulgolath, Hebrew for "skull," and may derive its name from the form of the mound or bare place where was the garden in which the rock-hewn tomb of Joseph had been excavated. The Vulgate translates the word Calvaria, a skull, from which our word "Calvary" is derived. The English version in <a href="../../par/luke/23-33.htm">Luke 23:33</a> thus translates the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and from this passage the word has been naturalized in our language. There is no authority for the appellation "Mount Calvary." The name probably refers to the shape of the site where the event took place. From this verse we learn that Jesus went forth to the spot, and (<a href="../../par/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>) John further says it was "nigh unto the city," therefore not within it. The same position relative to the city is obvious from <a href="../../par/matthew/28-11.htm">Matthew 28:11</a>, where the Roman guard came from the tomb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The Romans were accustomed to execute their criminals in some conspicuous position, adjoining a traveled road, so that those passing by, as well as those who congregated for the purpose, might know and learn its meaning. They reached the chosen spot - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-18.htm">John 19:18</a></div><div class="verse">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where they crucified him</span>. As John barely mentions this awful climax of his Gospel, it is not needful here to enlarge upon the heartrending details of this hideous process, one which Cicero described as "crudelissimum,teterrimum,summum supplicium," one from which no Roman citizen could suffer, and which was reserved for the most ignominious and degraded of mankind - for traitors, brigands, and condemned slaves. It is sufficient to say that, from the mention of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/23-38.htm">Luke 23:38</a>), the cross was not simply of the T shape called crux commissa, but rather (Luthardt and Zockler) of the familiar shape + and termed crux immissa, upon the upper arm of which the title or accusation, which had been placed round his neck, was affixed. The victim of this punishment was stripped, laid on the central bar, and the arms attached by ropes to the transverse beam, the hands and feet fastened with huge iron nails to the wood. A sedile was arranged to bear a portion of the weight of the body, which would never have been sustained by the gaping wounds. The cross was then raised by the executioners, and thrust with a fierce jerk into the hole or socket prepared for it. There was nothing in this inhuman torture necessarily to occasion death. The sufferers often lingered for twelve hours, and sometimes for several days, dying at last of thirst, starvation, and utterly intolerable agony. The Romans generally left the bodies to be devoured by birds of prey; the Jews buried the corpses. Constantine I., after his conversion, out of reverence for the Lord whom he had chosen, abolished the punishment, which, far more terrible than one by wild beasts or fire, has never been renewed, and rarely practiced in Europe since that day. There, then, these Jews, by the hands of lawless men, by Roman executioners, "crucified the Lord of glory," and by their hideous insensibility to goodness, by judicial blindness, bigotry, envy, and pride, not knowing the infinite crime they were committing, offered up a sacrifice, slew the Lamb of God, killed a Passover of transcendent price. That torture-tree has become his throne, and the very symbol of all that is most sacred and awe-inspiring in the entire region of human thought. They did not by this gross and inconceivable wickedness bring their rage to its full satisfaction; for <span class="cmt_word">they crucified two other with men with him either side one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, an expression only found in this passage and <a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and Jesus in the midst,</span> most prominent in this tragedy, and exalted to what they believed was the very pinnacle of shame. The synoptic narrative has told us these two men were "robbers" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) or (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) "malefactors," who, according to their own confession, were "suffering the due reward of their deeds." For a while both these dying ruffians tried to add torment to their quiet and patient fellow-Sufferer. Luke's account of the change that came over one of them as the awful hours rolled on is one of the sublimest portents that attended the Crucifixion. John passes this well-known incident by, most obviously supplementing the synoptists' narrative with matter which they had omitted. It is strange that John, if he had simply a theological purpose in his selection of facts, should have omitted the sublime prayer, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>), a revelation of compassion, power, inward agony, blended with Divine prerogative and unspeakable tranquility, which has done so much to reveal "the heart of Christ," the essence and character of the living God.

He seems muttering to himself, "Let him be Chief of malefactors, but he is and will be King of the Jews nevertheless, and I do not ignore the memories of either David or Solomon, Zerubbabel, Hyrcanus, or Idumaean Herod." The title differs slightly in its phrase in the four evangelists, yet they all preserve literatim the central fact of the change, "the King of the Jews." John alone mentions the circumstance, which may explain the minute differences (so Gresswell, 'Diss.,' 42.), viz. that it was written in three languages, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the vernacular, or "Hebrew;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the official, or "Latin;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the speech generally understood by all strangers, or "Greek." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The minute differences may be represented by Matthew using the Hebrew, Mark the Latin, and Luke and John the Greek, the latter simply adding the personal name of the crucified. Whether this hypothesis explaining the "this is" of Matthew, the "Rex Judaeorum" of Mark, the "this" of Luke, and the fuller statement of John, which gives what was contained in one of the languages, be verified or not, it should be observed that the four evangelists agree as to the verbatim form of the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, John more abundantly supplementing the information by recording the full <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Even Strauss does not regard these differences as discrepancies.

Codex B reads <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> first. The Latin form of the trilingual inscription may very naturally have been placed at the top. The reference to this peculiarity of the inscription as also given by Luke, in T.R., is there omitted by Tischendorf (8th edit.), Tregelles, Westcott and Herr, and R.T., M'Clellan, and others; it looks as if the reading had been borrowed from John, or rather from the spurious 'Acts of Pilate,' with which it verbally agrees. The proclamation of Christ's royalty to the three great divisions of the civilized world is a providential fact of supreme interest. Thousands of Jews would carry the news of the mysterious "title" to far-off places, and ponder it in their homes. This was part of the preparation made by Divine providence for announcing to the whole world the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Since the cross from the very first thus became a throne, and the Crucifixion an installation into the kingdom, we learn thence the meaning of the Christian principle, "If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him."

They must have hurried back to him with petulant resentment of his intentional scorn.

Had they not already declared that they had no king but Caesar? Doubtless he said, "I am the King of the Jews;" he made the claim, not in a sense which could be rationally entertained in a Roman court, but in the true Messianic and prophetic sense. The priests knew perfectly well that because Jesus had altogether refused, Heir of David though he was, to entertain the Kingship in the only sense in which they desired to proclaim it, they had rebelled against him and rejected his claims. For Pilate to have given any color to the purely spiritual prerogative of their Victim roused their remonstrance, but that it might be treated as identification of the national cause with a convicted and crucified felon exasperated them.

While this was going on in the Praetorium, the tragedy was proceeding at Golgotha; and St. John now returns thither, and describes an event of intense interest which occurred, as all synoptists say, at the very time of the elevation of the cross. John, however, has further facts and symbolic detail to append which were omitted by them.

As these garments may have been of varied value, the lot may have been required; but John, in his narrative, throws fresh light upon this latter and humiliating act. <span class="cmt_word">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part.</span> This shows that a quaternion of soldiers, and not the "whole band," had been told off for the infernal deed.

The rest of the garrison were not far off, should they be required; moreover, the servants of the high priest were ready to act on an emergency; but John adds, <span class="cmt_word">And also the coat</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>); the long vesture which clothed his whole person, reaching from the neck to the feet, and which, when removed, left the sacred body naked. This had probably not been removed by either tiered or Pilate before, and the cursed indignity thus reached its climax (Hengstenberg; cf. <a href="../../par/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now the coat was without seam</span> <span class="cmt_word">from the top</span> - from the upper portions - <span class="cmt_word">woven throughout</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, an adverbial form) - woven, possibly, by the mother who loved him, and corresponding with the dress of the priests. Keim and Thorns see here "a symbolizing of Jesus as the High Priest" (see Holman Hunt's celebrated picture the "Light of the World"). Certainly John saw the Lord in his glory with a garment of the kind (woven of radiant light, and reaching to the feet, <a href="../../par/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>.). The unity of the Savior's seamless vesture has been variously treated in patristic literature: as symbolic of the unity of natures in his Person, by the Monephysites; and by Cyprian ('De Unitate Ecclesiae,' &sect; 7) in his conflict with Novatianists, as symbolic of the unity of the Church, and he actually builds on it his dictum, "He cannot possess the garment of Christ who parts and divides the Church of Christ." This garment could not be conveniently divided. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-24.htm">John 19:24</a></div><div class="verse">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.

Here is the true explanation of the "lot" referred to by the synoptists, and moreover a subsequent reflection of the evangelist, who saw once more a realization of the prophetic picture of the ideal Sufferer at his last extremity of reproach and humiliation. He quotes almost verbally from the LXX., <span class="cmt_word">That the Scripture might be fulfilled</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which</span> <span class="cmt_word">saith</span>), <span class="cmt_word">They parted my garments among them</span> (to themselves), <span class="cmt_word">and for my vesture</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they did cast lots.</span> If John had quoted accurately from the Hebrew, he would have preserved more obviously the contrast between the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>,which yet was clearly in his mind. The <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> was the portion of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> upon which the lots were cast. Lucke and De Wette (though not Meyer) regard it as certain that John took the  <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> as identical with the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>. Strauss describes <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. as the programme of the Crucifixion. He styles it thus for the purpose of undervaluing the historical character of the narrative, and of suggesting that it owed its origin to the prophetic picture rather than to the actual fact (so Thoma). There is another sense in which the statement is true. Unconsciously the various concomitants of the suffering of the Holy One of God were being one by one realized by the Divine Lord. The synoptists, without reference to the ancient oracle, record the fact imperfectly. John adds what came under his own eye, explains their inadequate representation of the "lot," and discerns the veritable fulfillment of the prophecy. The reference in Matthew to this fulfillment of prophecy is expunged from the text by Tischendorf (8th edit.), Westcott and Herr, and R.T., on the authority of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, D, nine uncials and two hundred manuscripts, numerous versions and Fathers. Thus the fourth evangelist is the solitary authority for this fulfillment of the prophetic word, and he reveals a feature which is sometimes denied him by those who try to establish the Gentile origin of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">These things therefore the soldiers did.</span> A graphic and historic touch, corresponding with the method in which Herodotus closed his account of the slaughter at Thermopylae. In John's case more was suggested. While Pilate had announced to the world that Jesus of Nazareth was "King of the Jews," and Caiaphas had declared that "it was expedient that one man should die for the people," the Roman soldiers, without any knowledge of Hebrew oracles, had all unconsciously filled up the features of the suffering Messiah in literal harmony with the ancient prediction. In a commentary on John's Gospel we cannot here discuss some of the other impressive features of the Crucifixion, upon which the fourth evangelist is silent. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all describe a revolting scene of brutal mockery which ridiculed the dying Lord with his helplessness, and charged him with hypocrisy, scoffed at his having boasted of his Divine Sonship, and of power to build the demolished temple in three days - an ominous charge, which he was so soon to meet. They did not see that they were destroying the temple of his body, and that he would verily paralyze all their power to crush his kingdom by building it up at the predestined hour. The great cry was, "Come down from the cross, and we will accept thy claims, and believe that thou art ' Son of God.'" This was even a greater provocative of his human soul than that which the devil had suggested in the wilderness, or which he had endured on the Mountain of Transfiguration (Godet's 'Biblical Studies of the New Testament'). He knew that he could at once have stepped upwards from the high mountain on the shining way, and left behind him a perfect and most gracious memorial and ideal of the blessed life. But he had a "decease to accomplish," and he came down to "give his life a ransom for many," to take all our burden and all our care and all our sin upon him, to lay down his life that he might take it again (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>). But the question does arise - Has he not done enough to meet all the case? Has he not been offered up as certainly as Isaac was when Abraham bound his son upon the altar? Could he not, might he not, now come down from the cross, having perfectly consecrated himself? Would he not by this act make converts of the Sanhedrin? and would not tens of thousands at once turn their curses into jubilant hosannas? The chief priests join in the same taunt, and, according to Matthew and Mark, even the dying robbers cast the same reproaches in his teeth. The special taunt was, "He saved others; himself he cannot save." Sublimely true, the very hurricane of abuse, as it reaches him, is transformed into the sweetness and fragrance of the eternal love. He had power in the desert to make the kingdoms of the world his own, if he would have bowed down to the prince of this world. He had authority to vanish into the ethereal home with Moses and Elijah. He might have saved himself, but he could not. He must drink the cup to the final dregs. He must bear the death-penalty itself. If he had not done this, the sympathy with man had fallen infinitely below the demands of his own heart. Sin and death would still have been inseparably linked; the curse would not have been broken, nor the sacrifice been completed. As before Pilate, Herod, and the rest, he was silent. No murmur, no rebuke, broke from him. The breath of his mouth is as vet no two-edged sword. But the penitent brigand, overcome by his majestic patience, pleads for mercy, and, after the long hours have passed, the cry of the helpless sufferer at his side meets with immediate response, while all the cruel howling bigots around him could not prevail to draw from him one syllable of remonstrance! The "To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise" is the royalist of all the words from the cross. According to the hypothesis of the T&uuml;bingen school, they ought unquestionably to have been selected for citation by the author of the Fourth Gospel. The assumption of the existence and reality of his kingdom, and the admission in the other world of his conscious Lordship over the souls of men, is the most explicit and unapproachable claim that he ever made to Divine prerogatives. John takes notice of another most impressive scene, in which himself had personal concern, and which affected the remainder of his own wonderful life. An incident this which the other evangelists did not presume to touch. It was the Divine expression of the true humanity of the Son of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a></div><div class="verse">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there were standing by the cross of Jesus.</span> Matthew says (Matthew 28:55; <a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40, 41</a>) that many women stood afar off beholding these things, and amongst them Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James (the less, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the son of Alphaeus) and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children, expressly identified here as elsewhere with Salerno, "women who followed him from Galilee" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-55.htm">Luke 23:55</a>), and ministered unto him. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> of this verse implies that, in the courage of their love and tenderness, they had drawn nearer to the cross, led on as it would seem by <span class="cmt_word">his mother herself</span>, whom John with fuller knowledge mentions as the most important member of one group. John adds, and the sister of his mother, then (it must be admitted without any conjunctive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) he adds, <span class="cmt_word">Mary</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (wife) <span class="cmt_word">of Clopas, and Mary Magdalen</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is by almost all admitted to be identifiable with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, Alphaeus, of <a href="../../par/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>. Consequently, "the Mary (of Clopos)" is none other than the mother of James the less-known disciple, as well as of others. And this second Mary is identically the same as the Mary spoken of in Matthew and Mark by slightly different phraseology. The question arises - Does John here speak, then, of four women? or does he say that this Mary was the sister of the Virgin Mary? If "Mary the wife of Clopas" be the sister of the Virgin, then James the less, Joses, and others are cousins of our Lord. This hypothesis has been used by those who identify these men with the "brethren of the Lord;" but it is rendered improbable by the fact referred to twice over in the synoptists and John, that his "brethren did not believe in him," and the growing certainty that "James the brother of our Lord" was not "James the less." Moreover, it is improbable that two sisters should have the same name. The other supposition is that the third woman mentioned by the synoptists (namely, Salome, the mother of Zebedee's sons) was the sister of the mother of Jesus. Against this is the non-appearance of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> between the second and third names. This absence may be simply due to the fact that John mentions "two and two," singling them out from "the many women," according to his wont. Against it, Godet and others have urged that we have no other hint of the relationship; but of many similar facts throughout the Gospel we have only the slenderest indications - take, for instance, the identification of Judas (not Iscariot) with Lebbaeus and Thaddseus; Nathanael with Bartholomew - and there is much which makes the identification natural. It is after the manner of John to omit the name of Salerno, as he always does his own throughout the Gospel and Epistles. But the entire narrative from beginning to end is illumined by the fact that John was the near relative of Jesus. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> flashes into light and justification at once. Very much, both in the synoptic and Johannine narratives, receives a deeper meaning. The early friendship, the private ministry of our Lord, with John as his principal companion, the request of Salome, and the exquisite incident which now follows, all receive a richer meaning when it becomes clear that Salome was so nearly related to Jesus. In this conclusion Wieseler, Luthardt, Lange, Westcott, Sears, Moulton, Schaff, and others coincide, though Meyer and Hengstenberg take the other view. Hengstenberg thinks the tradition of three Marys is enough to counterbalance what he calls a learned device! Assuming, then, that John was so dear a friend, so near a relative, we understand better what follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus then, seeing the</span> (his) <span class="cmt_word">mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, saith to the</span> (his) <span class="cmt_word">mother, Woman, behold thy son!</span> The term "Woman" was on his lips an honorific title rather than an expression of coldness. No atom of disrespect or failure of affection is evinced, nor can we conceive it possible that our Lord was here separating himself in his mediatorial character from all relationship with the mother who bore him! This view, adopted by Hengstenberg in part, by Steinmeyer, Luthardt, Alford, and originally by Professor Hoffmann of Erlangen, seems utterly inconsistent with the spirit of Christ. True, he had warned her not to intrude upon his modes of activity (<a href="../../par/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>), and had said that his disciples were his brothers, sisters, mother; but the greatness of his heart is human to the last. No Monophy-site explanation of the status majestaticus, no Nestorian severance of the Divine and human Christ, is needed. Christ yearned over the mother whose heart was being pierced by his agony, and with filial anxiety entrusted her, not to those brothers of his  - whatever was the degree of their relationship to him - who, nevertheless, did not believe on him, but to the disciple whom he loved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-27.htm">John 19:27</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own <i>home</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - (b) Filial love - "Behold thy mother!" and the issue. <span class="cmt_word">Then he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother!</span> The very garments that covered him had been rudely divided among the soldiers. He is therefore as a dead man, and yet he made the most royal gifts and precious assignments of that which was nevertheless inalienable. He gave a mother to his dearest friend. He gave a son most precious to the bereaved and desolate and broken heart of his widowed mother. Inconceivable that Weisse should call this "the basest self-adulation." The animus manifested to this document by a certain school partakes of the animosity of political partisanship. <span class="cmt_word">From that hour</span>, says the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">the disciple took her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to his own home. This may have been some temporary</span> lodging in Jerusalem, but it is more probable, as we have seen, that Salome and John had homes both in Jerusalem (see Introduction, p. 56.) and Capernaum. The mere phrase is used in <a href="../../par/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a> in a more general sense of all the apostles. It is not necessary to believe that John at once removed the sacred deposit and bequest of his dying Lord to that home, though it is just possible. Bengel and many others think so, but it is not necessary to limit the meaning of "hour" to moment. The departure could hardly have taken place till all was over. In this brief reference a key is given to what John became to the Church. We must think of Salerno and John ever by the holy mother of the Lord, whether at Jerusalem, Capernaum, or Ephesus. The few words speak volumes, and his reticence here, as elsewhere, gives an unutterable grandeur to his words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a></div><div class="verse">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - (c) "I thirst" - the last agony. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - It does not come within the purpose of John to record the portents which attended the final scene - either the supernatural darkness on the one hand, or the rending of the veil of the temple on the other. He does not record the visions of the saints, nor the testimony of the centurion (see <a href="../../par/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45-56</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-33.htm">Mark 15:33-39</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-49</a>). He does not record the further quotation of <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>; the cry, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" nor the misinterpretation of the multitudes; nor the jeer at his dying agonies. But he does record two of the words of the Lord, which they had omitted. He, moreover, implies that he had purposely left these omissions to be filled up from the synoptists, for he adds, <span class="cmt_word">After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had been</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">now finished, said, I thirst, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> John heard in this word the comprehensive cry which gathered up all the yearnings and agonies of his soul, which fulfilled its travail, which expressed the awful significance of his suffering, and strangely filled up the prophetic picture (<a href="../../par/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a></div><div class="verse">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put <i>it</i> upon hyssop, and put <i>it</i> to his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was set there</span> <span class="cmt_word">a vessel full of vinegar</span>, probably for the use of the soldiers, and occasionally offered to the sufferers to soothe a part of their torment. John clearly associates this fact with the unconscious fulfillment of prophecy. Matthew gives it, with strange lack of connection, as following the cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" <span class="cmt_word">So they</span> (Matthew, "one") <span class="cmt_word">having placed</span> <span class="cmt_word">a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop.</span> This hyssop plant, if identical with the caper plant, does produce stems three or four feet long, and may therefore be identical with the "reed" mentioned in Matthew and Mark, while Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/23-36.htm">Luke 23:36</a>) refers the act to the soldiers offering him vinegar to drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elias will come and save him." They put it, brought it, <span class="cmt_word">presented it to his mouth</span>. This was not the stupefying draught which he refused, but an exhilarating one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - (d) "<span class="accented">It is finished</span>!" - <span class="accented">the great victory of completed sacrifice</span>. <span class="cmt_word">When he had received the vinegar, he said</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">It is finished! and he bowed his head and delivered up his spirit.</span> The other evangelists record yet another word of Divine and sublime submission, "Father, into thy hands," etc. John simply adds the climax, and leaves the Divine, inscrutable, mysterious fact in its awful grandeur. The world's debt was paid. The types and symbolism of the old covenant had been adequately fulfilled. The mighty work, undertaken by him who would realize the expectations of the oldest prophets and the unconscious prophecies of heathendom, was done. Every iota and tittle of the Law had been magnified. The reality of which the temple and the sabbath were shadows, the priesthood and the offerings innumerable were figures, had all been realized. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>! Consummatum est! From the ground of human nature, from the heart of the Man in whom all the wants, perils, sins, mysteries of the human race were gathered up, has gone the adequate admission of the righteous judgment of God against that nature in its present condition. Death itself becomes, not his shame, but his veritable glory. The sin of humanity is branded with an eternal curse, more deep than any previous manifestation of the Divine justice could have produced; and yet it loses its sting. God reconciles the world to himself by the death of his Son, by this curse thus falling upon his Only Begotten. The earthly judges are condemned by their Victim. The great and last enemy is itself wounded unto death. The Seed of the woman bruises the serpent's head when that Seed receives the bruise in its own heel. The Paschal Lamb is slain. The Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. The prince of this world is east out. The reader must turn to the synoptic narrative for the other portents of the Crucifixion  - the earthquake, the supernatural darkness, the rending of the temple veil, and the testimony of the Roman centurion. The silence of the Fourth Gospel concerning these events, on the supposition of its late orion, or on the hypothesis of the glorifying myth, or upon the suggestion that this evangelist was a theologizing mystic of the second century, who was merely fashioning the narrative to establish the doctrinal thesis of the Divine incarnation of the Logos, becomes entirely unintelligible. But the hypothesis that this eye-witness was supplementing other well-known narratives with particulars which came forcibly under his own observation, and made a deep impression upon his own mind, is suggested by every line. Dr. Westcott places "the seven words from the cross" in the following order: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">Before the darkness</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"><br />(2)</span> "Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"><br />(3)</span> "Woman, behold thy son:...  behold thy mother!"

It is a question whether the sixth or seventh word is the more triumphant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-31.htm">John 19:31</a></div><div class="verse">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that</i> they might be taken away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-37.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The piercing of the side, with its significance - the final close of the life of earth.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation; that is, the day before the sabbath</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42</a>). This note of time certainly blends both the synoptists and John in the assurance that the crucifixion took place on a Friday. It was also, according to the previous statement, the preparation of the Passover, which, we have seen, is better understood in that literal sense than in the sense of "the Friday of Passover week." Consequently, there was a twofold sanctity about that particular sabbath, seeing that the sabbatic rest of the day following the Paschal meal coincided with the ordinary weekly sabbath; (<span class="cmt_word">for great, or high, was the day of that sabbath</span>) (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a>; and notes on John 13:1; 18:28; 19:14). It was a "great" and "high" day in a sense far more profoundly impressive than any that could be derived from the ceremonial enactments of the Hebrew code. The sabbath of his rest came at length. The toil, the agony, are over, the whole world is transformed during its hours into his resting-place. There has been no such sabbath since the creative Word rested from all his work. <span class="cmt_word">In order that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath.</span> This statement, with the events which followed, strongly confirms our interpretation of the day of the Crucifixion. The Jews would scarcely have justified a crucifixion on the first sabbatic day of the feast, if they shrank from the proceeding here described as in danger of taking place on the ordinary sabbath. They follow the law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>) so far as it would apply, and hasten the dissolution of the crucified, if it had not already occurred. (They) <span class="cmt_word">asked Pilate that their legs might be broken</span> (crushed) [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the same as aorist passive, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (Winer, Eng. trans., p. 85), <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, first aorist passive], <span class="cmt_word">and that they might be taken away, as polluting corpses</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to crurifragium, is a Roman custom, as it is clearly established by numerous authorities (Suet., 'Aug.,' 67; Seneca, ' De Ira.,' 3:32; see Wettstein); - a brutal custom, which added to the cruel shame and torment, even though it hastened the end. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-32.htm">John 19:32</a></div><div class="verse">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first</span> - two of the quaternion employed on the one deed, and two on the other - and of the other which was crucified with him. <span class="cmt_word">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they brake not his legs.</span> Their barbarous mercy was unnecessary, and John caw in this another correspondence with the sacred symbolism and prophetic anticipations of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">But one of the soldiers pierced</span> - gashed, probably, for the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used in both senses - <span class="cmt_word">his side with a spear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;</span>, a lance, a heavy formidable weapon) to give him the coup de grace, should their expectation not be actually realized, <span class="cmt_word">and forthwith came there-out blood and water.</span> We do not enter into the numerous physiological reasons which have been advanced by Gruner, Bartholinus, and Dr. Stroud ('Physical Cause of the Death of Christ') for this event, but regard it as one of the great portents of the Crucifixion, which cannot be entirely explained as some physiologists have done. Dr. Schaff appears willing to accept the hypothesis that the extravagated blood, being first separated into its two constituents, was thus liberated from the pericardium - a phenomenon that might seem to justify the supposition of the evangelist, that it was blood and water. Dr. Stroud endeavored, with much medical learning, to show that this might follow the side-piercing if the Lord's physical death had followed, as he argued, from rupture of the heart due to his intense agonies. Sir R. Bennett has accepted this solution. Nor, further, do we see here any reference to the sacramental system of which John elsewhere says so little; but we do see a token miraculously given of the twofold power of his redemptive life and work <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> renovation, refreshment, rivers of living water issuing from the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> of Christ, the first great rush of spiritual power which was to regenerate humanity; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the expression of that redemptive process which was effected in the positive shedding of his precious blood. It was, moreover, a proof and sign given to Roman soldiers that their Victim was actually dead. We cannot think, with Westcott, that it was a kind of sign of the commencement of the resurrection-life, which goes perilously near to the assertion that he never really died. Moulton argues that the phenomena were physiologically possible if the-event occurred immediately after death. There is nothing in the narrative to prevent such juxtaposition. That John should have witnessed it, and been unable to understand it, and therefore put it down among the marvels of the Crucifixion, corroborates the veracity of the eye-witness (Webster and Wilkinson). The interesting catena of patristic interpretations given by Westcott ('Additional Note') shows that the earliest writer who refers to the marvel, Claudius Apollinaris, regarded it as expressive of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "the Word and the Spirit." Origen showed that from a corpse such a phenomenon could not occur; and so even in his death there are still the signs of the living one. Cyril of Jerusalem saw the two baptisms of blood and water; Chrysostom, the two sacraments, or the mysteries of baptism and of the flesh and blood. <span class="accented">Macarius Magnes</span> and <span class="accented">Apollinarius</span> saw an allusion to the side of Adam, from which Eve, the source of evil, was taken; that now the side of the second Adam should give forth the means of salvation and deliverance. Tertullian dwells on the two baptisms of water and blood; so Jerome; while Augustine sees in it the laver and the cup. That there was some special, abnormal phenomenon seems specially noticeable from the emphasis which the eye-witness lays upon the observation and record of the fact.

A vehement effort has been made to sever this testimony from the evangelist, and refer it to a third person <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and suppose that it took place during John's absence from the cross (so Weisse, Schweizer, Hilgenfeld, and others); but, as Meyer, Godet, etc., affirm there is no necessity whatever for such an interpretation. <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the subject of the sentence when it is clear from the context that the speaker himself is that subject (see <a href="../../par/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>). Concerning a third person, the writer could not have written, "He knoweth that he saith true things, that ye may believe," but rather, "We know that he saith true things, that we may believe." But John here speaks strongly of his own invincible conviction, and, as in <a href="../../par/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, it is here given to induce a stronger faith on the part of his readers - not of himself and his readers in the supernatural death, in the signs that accompanied it, adapted to convince the bystanders of its marvel, and to fill up the prophetic picture, Hilgenfeld, with strange perversity, urges that the clever forger of the narrative "falls out of his part" and forgets himself (see Luthardt on 'Authorship of the Fourth Gospel,' p. 180). The symbolical and allegorical explanations are numerous. E.g. Toplady's well-known hymn, "Rock of Ages," contains the words - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Let the water and the blood,<br />From thy riven side which flowed,<br />Be of sin the double cure,<br />Cleanse me from its guilt and power."</span>

A bone of him shall not be broken. This quotation from the ceremonial of the Passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-12.htm">Numbers 9:12</a>), where the lamb offered to God was to be shielded from unnecessary mutilation, is in harmony with the words of the Baptist, "Behold the Lamb of God!" and with Paul's language (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>), "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us," and shows that the Fourth Gospel does recognize this parallel, which is in a very remarkable way thus quietly reaffirmed. This passage acquires meaning from the supposition that the Jews were hurrying away to eat their Paschal lamb, not a bone of which could be legally broken. The opponents of the authenticity think that incidents are invented to establish the supposed relationship. Those who seek to reply to them by explaining away this reference to the Passover think that <a href="../../par/psalms/34-20.htm">Psalm 34:20</a> is referred to, "He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken;" but the force of that passage in this connection would violently clash with any such adaptation of it as could make it refer to the cruel and violent death of the Lord.

The second of the Old Testament quotations is in several ways important and noteworthy. <span class="cmt_word">They shall look on him whom they pierced</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The original passage is (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "They shall look upon me whom they pierced." The evangelist altered the ME into HIM, which, as it stands in the old oracle, and regarded as the language of Jehovah, is sufficiently surprising. The LXX. had felt the difficulty, and translated it <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "They shall look towards me, because they have insulted me." Their repentance and misgiving shall be aroused, because in response for those things which they have done contemptuously against me. It is interesting to see that John is more accurate in his Greek translation of this prophetic passage, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall look" with love and grace and repentance "on him whom (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) they pierced." This Greek rendering of the Hebrew is followed by Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, and is quoted by Justin Martyr; it is also found in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, forming a link of connection between the Gospel and the Apocalypse. Moreover, it is most impressive to find that the awful tragedy does not close even in the hands of this writer without a word of promise and hope. <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-8.htm">Zechariah 12:8-14</a> is clearly in the mind of the apostle. The merciful Lord waits for the repentance of Israel, of those who, by instigating Roman power for his destruction, pierced him by their trenchant ingratitude as well as by the Roman spear. It will be fulfilled more completely when every eye shall see him, and the full revelation of his majesty shall smite the whole world with penitence or despair.

This "Joseph" is introduced with the article (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span>), and a second before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>, implying to the reader that he is now. by reason of thesynoptic narrative, a well-known person. This Arimathsea is probably the Ramathaim of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, the birthplace of Samuel, known now as the Nebi Samwil, about two leagues north-west of Jerusalem (Caspari, &sect; 49). Hengstenberg thinks the site is Ramleh, eight hours from Jerusalem. The maps of the Palest. Explor. Fund place it about a league to the east of Bethlehem. He was a "rich man" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>) - a fact which the First Gospel recalls without quoting the remarkable oracle of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, that Messiah, Servant of Jehovah, was with the "rich in his death." We may judge that Joseph had a residence in Jerusalem, even though he may still be known as belonging to and "from" Arimathaea, because he bad prepared, hard by the metropolis, a sepulcher which as yet had never been used. He was, moreover, a <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>), a member of the Sanhedrin, of high character, "good and just.... waiting for, expecting the kingdom of God' (say Mark and Luke), "and by no means consentient to the counsel and deed of his colleagues" (adds Luke). The whole position is briefly put by John: <span class="cmt_word">Being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), who had been concealed as such up to this crowning climax of his Lord's humiliation, not daring to confess Christ, <span class="cmt_word">by reason of his fear of the Jews</span>. Strange that he and Nicodemus should have cast away their fears at such a moment! <span class="cmt_word">Joseph asked of Pilate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); a word that implies something of claim and confidence on his part. The synoptists all three use <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which rather denotes the position of a suppliant for a favor. <span class="cmt_word">That he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave.</span> This is supposed by some, who are anxious to make difficulties where none exist, that (according to <a href="../../par/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>) Pilate had already given permission for the crurifragium, and yet was astonished that he was dead already. The statement of Mark is perfectly consistent with this and with the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 31. Joseph, when all the transactions were over, sought for himself the privilege of a friend to take the body and bury it. Roman law permitted this privilege to friends; as Luthardt says, "The Christian martyrs of Rome were often buried in the catacombs." Not until death was obvious was it lawful to remove a body from the cross. The death had taken place; the Jews were prepared with Pilate's authorization to remove the corpse to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom. Joseph comes with a permission to take the corpse for honorable burial. <span class="cmt_word">He came therefore</span> - by reason of the permission - <span class="cmt_word">and took</span> <span class="cmt_word">the body</span> (of Jesus). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a></div><div class="verse">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound <i>weight</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there came also Nicodemus who at the first came to him by night</span> pointing back (as the evangelist also does at <a href="../../par/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50</a>) to the memorable converse with our Lord detailed in <a href="../../par/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1-20</a>, when Jesus made clear to his visitor that he would be lifted up, even as the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness." There is no proof that this "ruler of the Jews" and "master in Israel" had been encouraged by the act of Joseph; but it might seem that these two between them had arranged the costly cerements. There is a world of suggestion lying in this quietly mentioned fact. Doubtless there were many others of timid disposition, who had received deeper convictions than the narrative of the Passion seems to suggest. Nicodemus had said, "We know that thou art a Teacher sent from God." By reason of their unacknowledged faith, the way was prepared for the marvelous conversions of Pentecost and later days. Nicodemus came to the cross, in all probability aided by the loving cares of the women and the disciple whom Jesus loved, <span class="cmt_word">bringing a mixture</span> <span class="cmt_word">of myrrh</span>, an odoriferous gum, <span class="cmt_word">and aloes</span>, a fragrant wood, prepared for the embalming process, <span class="cmt_word">about an hundred pounds</span> <span class="cmt_word">weight</span>. This was a vast quantity. It reminds the reader of "the myrrh and aloes" of the royal Bridegroom of the Church (<a href="../../par/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>.); of the frankincense and myrrh brought by the Wise Men of the East; of the lavish gift of Mary the sister of Lazarus; of the outburst of boundless love which, spite of all the cruel persecution and rejection to which the Lord was exposed, at length was lavished upon him. The myrrh and aloes were pounded and mixed for the purposes of resisting the decomposition of death. The method was entirely to cover the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with its pungent and purifying powder, and then to swathe the whole body with the grave-clothes thus enriched. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a></div><div class="verse">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They took therefore</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nicodemus and Joseph - <span class="cmt_word">the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen clothes with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews to bury.</span> The synoptists specially mention a <span class="accented">linen cloth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), which they wound around it. It would seem probable, from what is afterwards said, that John wished to discriminate and affirm both processes (see <a href="../../par/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7</a>). The Jews' method differed from the Egyptians' embalming process. The latter removed all the viscera; and, by long baking and other processes, rendered the remaining shell of the corpse incorruptible and almost imperishable. The Jews' process of sepulture differed from the Roman cremation, and is emphasized. Importance was attached to a splendid funeral (<a href="../../par/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>); and this costly interment was not without its deep significance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/19-41.htm">John 19:41</a></div><div class="verse">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was in the place where he was crucified, close at hand to the very cross, a garden, and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein as yet no man was laid</span> (on site, see ver. 17, notes). John alone tells us of the "garden;" and he clearly saw the significance of the resemblance to the "garden" where Christ agonized unto death, and was betrayed with a kiss, and also to the garden where the first Adam fell from the high estate of <span class="accented">posse non peccare.</span> We are not told, however, by him that this sepulcher was Joseph's own (Matthew gives this explanation), nor that it was cut out of a rock, nor the nature or quality of it.

Thus from the hour of death, in which the love of God in Christ is seen at its most dazzling moral luster, and the glorification of Christ in his Passion reaches its climax, death itself beaus to put on new  unexpected forms and charms: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the symbolic effusion of water and blood; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the costly unguent spices and honorable burial lavished on One who had been put under ban, and had died the doom of the slave; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the garden and the watchers.

John assigns the rapidity with which the process could be completed as a reason for entombment in this particular garden sepulcher, and the ground of the urgency was the "preparation" solemnities. Once more the critics divide into two groups as to the significance of this reference to the date of the Lord's death. It is obvious that both the synoptists and John imply that it was a "Friday," and that the next day was the sabbath. Why, for the third time in the space of a few lines, should this circumstance be noticed? On the first occasion, the morning of the day is said to be "the preparation of the Passover;" on the second it is called "preparation before the sabbath," and John adds that that particular sabbath was a "high day," which, as we have seen, is explained by remembering that its sanctity was doubled, seeing that on that particular year the weekly sabbath would coincide with the 15th of Nisan, which had a sabbatic value of its own. Now he says for the third time it was the "preparation of the Jews" - as we understand it, a day or a time when special preparations were being made by the Jews, and that before sunset, for the slaying of the Paschal lamb. Moreover, the sabbath was drawing on (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/23-54.htm">Luke 23:54</a>). This threefold statement implies that there was something more in the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> than the Friday of the Passover week. It is curious to observe the precisely contradictory conclusions drawn from this statement by two classes of interpreters. Godet has given an interesting sketch (vol. 3. pp. 286, 287) of the extraordinary idea of M. Lutteroth, that the Lord was crucified on the 10th of Nisan! that he rose from the dead three full days and nights afterwards, on the morning of the 14th. But why should John three times over thus designate the day? and why should the synoptists lay such emphasis on its being the "preparation," if the day were really the first great day of the Passover Feast? It is remarkable that St. Paul, referring to the institution of the Eucharist, does not say "on the night of the Passover meal," but on "the night in which he was betrayed" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>), and he speaks of Jesus as the (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>) "Firstfruits of the dead," as though the resurrection morning coincided with the presentation of the firstfruits, which, on the idea that Jesus suffered on the 15th, would have been presented on the morning of the Jewish sabbath, while the reference in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-9</a>, written at the time of a Passover, is rather in favor of the slaying of the Paschal lamb coinciding with the death of Jesus than the institution of the Eucharist doing so. The most extraordinary reference to the <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span> is that which St. <a href="../../par/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28</a>:62 introduces, when he actually refers to the sabbath when it had begun (on the evening of the 14th or 15th, whichever it was, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after 6 p.m.) under the designation of "the day after the preparation." Generally the more important day would receive its own proper name, and not be designated by the less signal day. Why did not St. Matthew say, "On the morrow, which was the Sabbath"? The one group of interpreters answer that he wished to discriminate the veritable sabbath as distinct from the half-sabbath of the previous day, made so by being also the great day of the feast! But it is more natural to suppose that "the day of preparation," the death-day of the Lord, loomed so largely in the mind of the evangelist, that its morrow derived importance in this particular instance from itself. The only real difficulty in settling this wearisome controversy arises from one statement in the synoptists, which, if resolved in the rigid sense of limiting their expressions to the evening of the 14th and beginning of the 15th, involves us in grave difficulties when considering five or six distinct and independent statements of John's Gospel. We have shown at each of these places the double method of exegetical treatment that has been attempted, and in each case honesty compels us to admit that John is here in apparent discord with the synoptists. If, however, our Lord anticipated by a few hours the celebration of the Paschal supper, seeing that his "hour was come," not indeed deviating from the legal day (though, as Lord of the sabbath and greater than the temple, he was amply justified in doing so), but hurrying on the process between the 13th and 14th, when the water-bearers would be seen fetching their pure water for the purpose; and if he celebrated the Passover at the beginning rather than the end of the 14th of Nisan, then the apparent discord between John and the synoptists vanishes, and the terrible events of the trials and crucifixion of Jesus really took place at the time when the Jews (not Christ himself) were preparing for the Passover proper. On this hypothesis the two narratives would be no longer in hopeless antagonism. With this conclusion we are more satisfied, since, as we have seen in <a href="../../par/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a> and elsewhere, the synoptists themselves afford numerous corroboratory evidences (Introduction, pp. 92-95.).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/18.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 18"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 18" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/20.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 20"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 20" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/1.htm"><title>John 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../luke/24.htm" title="Luke 24">&#9668;</a> John 1 <a href="../john/2.htm" title="John 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</div><div class="comm">

The previous statements are thus stringently enforced, and, notwithstanding their tendency to diverge, are once more bound into a new, unified, and emphatic utterance. Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of the following sentences is charged with the sublime fulness of meaning which is involved in the three utterances of ver. 1. The first clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> declared that the Logos preceded the origination of all things, was the eternal ground of the world; the second <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> asserted his unique personality, so that he stands over against the eternal God, in mutual communion with the Absolute and Eternal One; the third clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> maintains further that the Logos was not a second God, nor merely Divine (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) or God-like, nor is he described as proceeding out of or from God (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), nor is he to be called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the God absolute," as opposed to all his manifestations; but the Logos is said to be <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">God"</span> - <span class="accented">God</span> in his nature and being. This second verse reasserts the eternal <span class="accented">relation</span> of such a personality "with God," and prepares the way for the statements of the following verses. The unity of the Logos and Theos might easily be supposed to reduce the distinction between them to subjective relations. The second verse emphasizes the objective validity of the relation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The creation of all things through the Logos, as the instrument of the eternal counsel and activity of God.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) taken one by one, rather than all things regarded in their totality - "all things," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all beings and elements of things visible or invisible, in heaven, earth, and under the earth (see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, etc.), <span class="cmt_word">came into being through him,</span> through the Logos, who was in the beginning with God, and was God. The Logos is the organ or instrument by which everything, one by one, was made. Two other words are used in the New Testament to denote "creation" - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, used in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, a word indicating the mind and act of the Creator; and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, as in <a href="../../par/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>, points generally to the thing made. The parts of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> indicate the progress of the work, the process of some creative order, the occurrence of some event in the evolution of Divine providence. This word does not by one solitary expression dogmatically convey the creative act, but the fact of the "becoming," from, it may be, the region of pure thought to that of existence, or from non-observation into prominence, or from an inchoate to a perfect development, or from nothing to something. The context must determine the fulness of its meaning. Occasionally, as in <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, it is powerfully contrasted with existence:  "Before Abraham was [had come into being] I am." The context here does not allow us to affirm that St. John repudiated the prior existence of the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, stuff, of which <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> were made. He does not affirm nor deny such a prior existency or condition, but by referring the universe in all its parts and items to the <span class="accented">Logos</span>, he absolutely ignores the Platonic notion of eternal matter. He could scarcely be ignorant of the speculation as it entered into the Philonic interpretation and formed the basis of the Gnostic speculations which were beginning to infest the early Church. By giving, however, a Divine origin and instrument to the "becoming" of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and strengthening his statement by the negative coassurance, he absolutely excludes the dualism of Philo and of Gnostic tendency. In asserting that the Logos is he or that through whom all things were made, the writer does not lower the dignity of the Logos by regarding him merely as the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Father, because the same preposition is used of the relation of the Father to the world or to his servants (<a href="../../par/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Elsewhere St. Paul powerfully affirms the same application of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>) to Christ's part in the Creation, reserving for the One God, the Father, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>. <span class="accented">From</span> God and <span class="accented">by</span> or <span class="accented">through</span> God are all things, still "all things" derive their existence "through" the activity, the will, the thought, of the Logos. "The sphere contracts as the blessing enlarges [query, 'intensifies']: existence for everything; life for vegetable and animal world; light for men" (Plummer). The same idea is made more explicit by the negative form in which it is restated: <span class="cmt_word">and without him -</span> that is, independently of his cooperation and volition (cf. <a href="../../par/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">not even</span> <span class="cmt_word">one thing came into being.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> could hardly be spoken of as "one thing," seeing, according to the theory, it was not a unit as opposed to a multiplicity, but the condition of all things. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> would drive harder against any recognition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> than would the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>. There is not the faintest approach to any supposition on John's part of the existence of such a primeval entity or eternal reality. The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> gives the student of the text and of the meaning grave difficulty. From very early times the Alexandrine Fathers and numerous uncial manuscripts, and an immense group of quotations and versions, unquestionably close the sentence we have just considered with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, and consider the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as the subject of the following clause, translating it either, <span class="accented">That which has come into being in him was life</span>; or, <span class="accented">that which has come into being was</span> (or <span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="accented">life in him</span> - for one manuscript, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, has rendered the text more grammatical by reading <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This, adopting the supposed early punctuation, Tregelles and Westcott  and Hort have introduced into the text; but R.T. has coincided with T.R. Dr. Westcott has an elaborate note affirming the deep thought involved in the "ancient punctuation," to the effect that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> refers, not merely to the original creation, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, but to the continued existence of that which has come into being. Of this, it is said, it derives its life, has its life in the Logos, and that this idea is expressed in a profounder way than by saying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>; that it <span class="accented">was life</span> (before it was called into being, or became) <span class="accented">in him.</span> This profound and mysterious statement is affirmed by Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott to find different but clear expression in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, "Thou art worthy, our Lord and our God, to receive glory, etc.; for thou didst create all things, and for thy pleasure they were [<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the reading preferred by Tisehendorf (8th edit.) and Westcott and Herr, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, 'they are'] and were created." Dr. Westcott thinks that "life" here represents "the Divine element in creation, that in virtue of which things 'are' each according to the fulness of its being." What has been created represents the eternal thought, the life that it had in the Logos before the world was. Unless one were compelled to take this thought by the exigencies of the textual criticism, we should hesitate to affirm that this can be the author's intention. To us the common punctuation is far more satisfactory m meaning: <span class="accented">Apart from him there came into existence not one thing which has come into existence.</span> This, in its grand comprehensiveness and individualizing of every molecule and every force, brings the mind of the reader down from eternity to time, from the creation to the preservation and providence of the world, and it prepares the way for the great assertion of the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">The Life</span>, and therefore inclusive of the fact that the Logos always has been and now is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">the Light</span> of men. <span class="cmt_word">In him was</span> <span class="cmt_word">life</span>. "Life" in all its fulness of meaning - that grand addition to things which confers upon them all their significance for men. There is one impassable chasm which neither history, nor science, nor philosophy can span, viz. that between nothing and something. The evangelist has found the only possible method of facing it - by the conception of One who from eternity has within himself the potency of the transition. There is another impassable chasm in thought - that between non-living atoms and living energies and individualities. The assertion now is that life, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span>, with all its manifestations and in all its regions; that the life of plant, tree, and animal, the life of man, of society, and of worlds as such; that the life of the body, soul, and spirit, the life transitory and the life eternal (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">was in the Logos</span>, "who was God and in the beginning with God." Elsewhere in the Gospel Jesus said that "as the Father had life in himself, so he gave to the Son to have life in himself" (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he communicated to the Son his own Divine self-dependence. The Gospel, however, lays the greatest emphasis on the life-giving powers of the Christ as incarnate Logos. The healing of the impotent man (ch. 5.), the raising of the dead Lazarus (ch. 11.), are chosen proofs of his life-giving energy. His claim (ch. 10.) to retake the life that he would voluntarily relinquish, and the august majesty with which, in his resurrection life (ch. 20, 21.), he proclaimed his absolute and final victory over death, constitute the reasons which induced the evangelist to lay down at the very outset that in the Logos was <span class="accented">life.</span> Life, in all its energies, past, present, and future, is an outcome, an effluence, of the Eternal Word. And the life was (and is) the light of men. Observe, it is not said here that physical life is a consequence or issue of the solar beam, or of the Word which in the beginning called light out of darkness. All the religious systems of the East and all modern sciences agree to extol and all but worship the light force, with all that seems so inseparably associated with it. The evangelist was reaching after something far more momentous even than that dogma of ancient faith and modern science. He is not speaking of "the light of the sun," but of "the light of men." Whatever this illumination may include, John does not refer it directly to the Logos, but to the life which is "in him." "The light of men" has been differently conceived by expositors. Calvin supposed that the "understanding" was intended - "that the life of men was not of an ordinary description, but was united to the light of understanding," and is that by which man is differentiated from animals. Hengstenberg regards it, in consequence of numerous associations of "light" with "salvation" in Holy Scripture, as equivalent to salvation; Luthardt with "holiness;" and many with the "eternal life," which would introduce great tautology. The context is our best guide. This light is said to be the veritable light which lighteth every man, and to be shining into darkness. Consequently, to make it the complex of all the gracious processes which beautify the renewed soul is to hurry on faster than the apostle, and to anticipate the evolution of his thought. "The light of men" seems to  be the faculty or condition, the inward and outward means, by which men know God. "The light of men" is the conscience and reason, the eye of the soul by which the human race comes into contact with truth and right and beauty. The perfections of God answering to these functions of the soul are not, and were never, manifested in mere matter or force. Until we survey the operations of God in <span class="accented">life</span> we have no hint of either. The lower forms of life in plant or animal may reveal the wisdom and beneficence and 'beauty of the Logos, and so far some light shines upon man; but even these have never been adequately appreciated until the life of man himself comes into view, then the Divine perfections of righteousness and moral loveliness break upon the eye of the soul. In the life of conscience and reason a higher and more revealing light is made to shine upon man, upon his origin, upon his Divine image, upon his destiny. In the spiritual life which has been superinduced upon the life of the conscience and of the flesh, there is the highest light, the brightest and warmest and most potent rays of the whole spectrum of Divine illumination. "The life" which was <span class="accented">in</span> the Logos "was," has always been, is now, will ever be, "the light of men." The plural, "of men" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), justifies this larger and sweeping generalization. The two "imperfects" (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>) placing the process in the past do not compel us to limit the operation to the past or ideal sphere. They assert what was "in the beginning," and which can never cease to be; but they partly imply further consequences, which the actual condition of man has introduced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The antagonism between light and darkness.</span> The highest manifestation and proof of the following statement will be found in that great entrance of the Eternal Logos into human life which will shed the most complete ray of Divine light upon men; but before that great event, during its occurrence, and ever since, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> throughout all times and nations, <span class="cmt_word">the light shineth in the darkness.</span> Many expositors, like Godet, after long wavering and pondering, resolve this expression into a distinct epitome of the effect of the Incarnation, the highest manifestation of the light in the theanthropic life, and hesitate to see any reference to the shining of the light upon the darkness of humanity or of the heathen world. They do this on the ground that there is no confirmation or illustration of this idea in John's Gospel. However, let the following parallels and expositions of this thought be considered. Our Lord discriminates between those who "hate the light" and "those who do the truth and come to the light" (<a href="../../par/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>). He delights in those whom the Father has given to him, and who come to him (<a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>). He speaks of "other sheep which are not of this fold, who hear his voice" (<a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). He tells Pilate that "every one who is of the truth heareth my voice "(<a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). In solitary address to the Father (<a href="../../par/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>), he says, "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me." In all these passages abundant hint is given of a direct treatment of souls antecedent to, or rather irrespective of, the special grace of Christ's earthly manifestation. This passage, so far, in the wide embrace of its meaning, asserts that <span class="accented">the light</span> here taken as the effluence of the life itself, perpetually, forever, shineth (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, not; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) - pours forth its radiance by its own essential necessity into the "darkness." "Darkness" and "light" are metaphors for moral conditions. Though there is a "light of men" which is the result of the meeting of man's capacity with Divine revelation, yet, for the most part, there is a terrible antagonism, a fearful negative, a veritable opposition to the light, a blinding of the eye of the soul to the clearest beam of heavenly wisdom, righteousness, and truth. Light has a battle to fight, both with the circumstances and the faculties of men. The ancient light which broke over the childhood of humanity, the brighter beams which fell on consciences irradiated and educated by a thousand ministries, the light which was focused in the incarnate Logos and diffused in all the "entrance of the Divine Word" into the heart of men, have all and always this solemn contingency to encounter - "The light shineth in the darkness." And the darkness apprehended it not. This word translated "apprehended" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) has, in New Testament Greek, undoubtedly the sense of "laying hold with evil intent," "overtaking" (<a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-18.htm">Mark 9:18</a>), "suppressing" (Lunge), "overcoming" (Westcott and Moulton); and a fine sense would arise from this passage if it means that, while the light shone into the darkness, it did not scatter it, but, on the other hand, neither did the darkness suppress or absorb and neutralize the light. Certainly the darkness was disastrous, tragical, prolonged, but <span class="accented">not</span> triumphant, even in the gloomiest moments of the pre-Incarnation period, even in the darkest hour and place of savage persecution, even in the time of outrage, superstitious impenetrability, or moral collapse. There are, however, two classes of difficulty in this interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is in LXX. used for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, and in many places in the New Testament has its ordinary classical sense, "lay hold of," "apprehend," "comprehend," "understand," "come to know,"  <span class="accented">intelligo</span>, and <span class="accented">cognosco</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>), though in this latter sense it is mostly used in the middle voice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When the apostle, in greater detail and more immediate reference to the individual illustrations he gives of the relation of the darkness to the light, says in vers. 10, 11, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; though slightly different words are used, yet the return upon the thought in these parallel sentences is too obvious to be overlooked. The nonsusceptibility of the darkness, the positive resistance it makes to the action of light, finds its strongest illustration in the more defined regions and narrower sphere of the coming of the Logos to the world, and in his special mission to his own people. In this view Alford, Bengel, Schaff, Godet, Luthardt, Tholuck, Meyer, Ewald, coincide, though the suggestion of Origen and Chrysostom, and in later years of Schulthess, Westcott, etc., has been powerfully urged. The broad, general fact is stated, not excluding the exceptions on which the evangelist himself afterwards enlarges. If the darkness had "apprehended" the light, it would no more be darkness. The melancholy fact is that the corruption in the world has been, for the most part, impervious to the light alike of nature, of life, of conscience, and even of revelation. Hence, says Bengel, "the occasion for the Incarnation." This is exaggeration, because the whole record of the incarnate Word is a continuous story of the resistance of the darkness to the light.

At this point the evangelist touches on the temporal mission and effulgence of the true Light in the Incarnation; yet this paragraph deals with far more general characteristics and wider ranges of thought than the earthly ministry of Christ on which he is about to enlarge. First of all, he deals with the testimony of John in its widest sense; afterwards he enlarges upon it in its striking detail. Consequently, we think that "the man," "John," is, when first introduced, referred to in his representative character rather than his historical position. The teaching of the prophets and synoptists shows that "John" was rather the exponent of the old covenant than the harbinger of the new. He was the embodiment of the idea of prophet, priest, and ascetic of the patriarchal, Mosaic, and latest Hebraic revelation. He was "more than a prophet." No one greater than he had ever been born of woman, and his functions in these several particulars are strongly impressed upon that disciple who here loses his own individuality in the strength of his Master's teaching. Through this very "man sent from God" the apostle had been prepared to see and personally receive the Logos incarnate. His personality gathered up for our author all that there was in the past of definite revelation, while Jesus filled up all the present and the future. First of all, he treats the mission of the Baptist as representative of all that wonderful past. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <i>men</i> through him might believe.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This man came</span> (historic, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for witness, that he might bear witness concerning the Light.</span> The entire prophetic dispensation is thus characterized. That which the Baptist did, Malachi, Isaiah, Elijah, Hosea, Moses, had done in their day. He came, and by penetrating insight and burning word, by flashes of moral revelation and intense earnestness, "bare witness concerning the Light" which was ever shining into the darkness. His aim and theirs was to prevent the forces of darkness from suppressing or absorbing the light. He came to sting the apathy and disturb the self-complacency of the darkness. He came to interpret the fact of the Light which was shining but not apprehended; and so did all the prophetic ministry of which he was the latest and most illustrious exponent. He came to assert the meaning for man of all God's perfections; to call conscience from its death sleep; to draw distinctions of tremendous significance between moral and ceremonial obedience; to exalt obedience above sacrifice, and works meet for repentance above Abrahamic privilege; to warn by lurid threatenings of a fiery wrath and a terrible curse which would fall on the disobedient, though consecrated, people. In this he was but the last of a goodly fellowship of prophets who bore witness to the Light of life which had its being in the Eternal Logos of God. He came, as they all had come, with a view of producing results far greater than, as a matter of fact, they have actually achieved. He came to bear such testimony <span class="cmt_word">that all through him</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the force of his appeal or by the fierce glow thus cast upon the perils and follies of the hour, <span class="cmt_word">might believe</span> - might realize the full significance of the Light which they had hitherto refused to accept. The greatness of this expectation corresponds with the hope which the ministry of Jesus failed also to realize (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-9.htm">Matthew 11:9-14</a>). The splendid ministry of this "burning and shining lamp" might, it would seem, have brought all Israel to  acknowledge Christ as the Light of the world; but "the darkness apprehended it not." The entire prophetic dispensation, the testimony which the priestly services and sacrifices bore to the evil of sin and to the awfulness of righteousness, as well as the condemnation of the follies and pleasures of the world, involved in John the Baptist's ascetic profession, might have roused all Israel to believe in the Light. He gathered together all the forces of the Mosaic, prophetic, Levitical, Essenic ministries to bear on the people. Everything that Law could do was done to reveal the Light; but "all" did not believe, for "the darkness apprehended it not."

The distinction here drawn between John and the Light is thought by some expositors to point to the condition of the Ephesian Church, in the neighbourhood of which there still lingered some who placed John in even a higher position than that accorded to Jesus (<a href="../../par/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3, 4</a>); but the teaching of the evangelist is far more comprehensive than this. <span class="accented">The Light</span> of men has higher source and wider range of operation than that of any prophetic man. All that he, that any seer whatsoever can do, is to bear witness to it. The prophets, from Moses to John, derived all their power, their sanction, and the corroboration of their message, from the Logos light shining through conscience and blazing through providential events and burning up the stubble of human action with unquenchable fire. The prophets are not the light of God; they are sent to bear witness to it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>That</i> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">The illumination of the archetypal Light before incarnation.</span> There are at least three grammatical translations of this verse. Either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with Meyer, we may give to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> the complete sense of existence, presence, and include in it the full predicate of the sentence; thus: "Existing, present (when John commenced his ministry), was the veritable Light which enlighteneth every man coming into the world." But the clause, "coming into the world," would here not only be superfluous, but moreover, while used elsewhere and often of Christ's incarnation, is never used of ordinary birth in the Scriptures, though it is a rabbinical expression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Lange, Moulton, Westcott, Godet, applying the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to the <span class="accented">light</span> rather than to <span class="accented">man</span>, translate it, "That was the true Light which lighteth every man, by coming into the world, or that cometh into the world." The difficulty of this is that it makes the coming into the world, in some new sense, the occasion of the illumination of every man, although the evangelist has already spoken (ver. 4) of the Life which is the Light of men. A third method is to make the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> the true predicate of the sentence, and translate thus: <span class="cmt_word">The veritable Light which illumines every man was coming</span> (ever coming) <span class="cmt_word">into the world;</span> and there is a sense and manner of his coming which transcends all others, about which he is to speak at length. This might receive another meaning if <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> were equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>; then a positive reference would here he made to the historic fact of the Incarnation. But it seems to me the evangelist is drawing a contrast between the continuous coming into the world of the veritable Light and the specific Incarnation of ver. 14. Consequently, the author here travels over and connotes a wider theme, namely, the operation of that archetypal Light, that veritable Light which differs from all mere reflections of it, or imitations of it, or luminous testimonies to it. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is important. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="../../par/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a> and John 5:31, and very often to denote the true in opposition to the false, the veracious as distinct from the deceptive. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>), First Epistle (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>), and Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>), and hardly anywhere else (see Introduction), for the real as opposed to the phenomenal, the archetypal as opposed to the various embodiments of it, the veritable as distinct from that which does not answer to its own ideal. Now, about this veritable light, in addition to all that has been said already, two things are declared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It illumines every man, giveth light to every individual man, in all time. Though the darkness apprehendeth it not, yet man is illumined by it. Various interpretations have been given of the method or conditions of this illumination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The light of the reason and conscience - the higher reason, which is the real eye for heavenly light, and the sphere for the operation of grace. This would make the highest intellectual faculty of man a direct effulgence of the archetypal Light, and confirm the poet Wordsworth's definition of conscience as "God's most intimate  presence in the world." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The inner light of the mystical writers, and the "common grace" of the Remonstrant theology. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the Divine instruction bestowed on every man from the universal manifestation of the Logos life. No man is left without some direct communication of light from the Father of lights. That light may be quenched, the eye of the soul may be blinded, the folly of the world may obscure it as a cloud disperses the direct rays of the sun; but a fundamental fact remains - the veritable Light illumines every man. Then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is further declared that this Light was ever coming into the world. Bengel and Hengstenberg, as Lange and Baumgarten-Crusius, regard it as in the purely historic sense, declaratory of the great fact of the Incarnation. But Ewald, Keim, Westcott, and others decide that it refers to his <span class="accented">continual coming</span> into the world. Up to the time of the Incarnation, the great theme of the prophets is (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the Coming One. Nor can we conceal the numberless assurances of the old covenant that the Lord of men was always "coming," and did come, to them. At one time he came in judgment, and at another time in mercy; now by worldwide convulsions, then by the fall of empires; again by the sense of need, of guilt and peril, by the bow of promise which often broke in beauty on the retreating storm cloud, by the mighty working of conscience, by the sense given to men of their Divine relationships and their dearness to God, - by all these experiences <span class="accented">he has ever been coming</span>, and <span class="accented">he cometh still.</span> Ever since the coming in the flesh and the subsequent cessation of that manifestation, he has ever been coming in the grace of the Holy Spirit, in all the mission of the Comforter, in the fall of the theocratic system and city, in the great persecutions and deliverances, the chastisements and reformations, the judgments and revivals of his Church. The eternal, veritable Light which does, by its universal shining, illumine <span class="accented">every</span> man, is still coming. The cry, "He is coming," was the language of the noblest of heathen philosophies; "He is coming," is the burden of the Old Testament; "He is coming again," is the great undersong of the Church to the end of time: "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="accented">The twofold effect of the pre-Incarnation activity in the elected nation and individuals.</span> The highest expression of this truth was seen in the unique "coming" of which the evangelist had been the spectator and witness; but the words cannot be limited to it - they stretch back to the beginning of the creation of the world and on to the final consummation. They explain or divide the solemn theme of the previous announcement into two related proofs of the fact that the Light which illumines every man shineth in darkness, and that the darkness apprehendeth it not. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Of him who was evermore coming into the world, it is said, <span class="cmt_word">In the world he was, and the world was made</span> (came into being) <span class="cmt_word">through him, and the world recognized him not</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a term specially used by St. John to denote the ordered whole of the universe, viewed <span class="accented">apart</span> from God (see Introduction). Sometimes this is emphasized by the pronoun, "<span class="accented">This</span> world," when it is contrasted with the higher and heavenly "order" to which the Lord's personality belonged, both before and after this manifestation in the flesh. From being thus the scene of ordered existence apart from God, it rapidly moves into the organized resistance to the will of God, and therefore it often denotes humanity taken as a whole apart from God and grace. It may be the object of the Divine love and compassion (<a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), while the redemption and deliverance of the world from sin is the great end of the ministry and work of Jesus (ver. 29); but throughout this gospel "the world" is the synonym of the adverse power and order of humanity, until it is illumined, regenerated, by the Spirit of God. The world here signifies humanity and its dwelling place, considered apart from the changes wrought in any part of it by grace. The three assertions concerning the world drop the imagery of light and life, and by their emphatic concatenation, without the assistance of a Greek particle, tell the tragic story of human departure from God. Thus only can the mystery of the previous verses be explained. At the very forefront of the argument of the Gospel is put a statement which concedes the strange perplexity of the rejection of the incarnate Logos. Not only does the entire narrative illustrate the awful fact, strange and inconceivable as such an idea appears when baldly stated, but the author generalizes the antipathy between the Logos and the world into a more comprehensive, damning, and yet undeniable, proposition. From the beginning, though the world came into being through the Logos, though he was in the world, in every atom of matter, in every vibration of force, in every energy of life, yet the world, notwithstanding all its power of recognizing the fact, yet the world, as concentrated in an antagonistic humanity, <span class="accented">did not</span> come to know him fully (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>). This is the lesson we learn from all the melancholy and tragic perversions of his glorious perfections which every heathenism and every cultus, and even every philosophy, has perpetrated. St. Paul says precisely the same thing: "The world by wisdom knew not God" (see also  <a href="../../par/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-22</a>, which might be taken as an inspired commentary on the whole passage). And the awful statement is still, with reference to the majority of men, true, that "the world knoweth not God, neither the Father, nor the Word, nor the Holy Ghost." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - It is not without interest that the ideas contained in these verses did not need a second century to evolve them; they were current in Paul's letters, a hundred years before the date assigned by some to this Gospel. Here the question arises - Has no more direct approach been made to our race than that which is common to <span class="accented">every</span> man? Undoubtedly the whole theocratic dispensation would be ignored if this were not the case - and consequently the evangelist continues the recital of the peculiarities and specialties of the approach of the Logos to the human understanding. <span class="cmt_word">He came unto his own possession</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). Here all expositors agree to see the special manifestation of the Logos to the house of Israel, which is called in numerous passages of the Old Testament, God's own possession (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his own</span> (people) <span class="cmt_word">received him not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 4, and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> of ver. 10). Here, again, the most astonishing, direct and prominent illustration of such a statement is seen in the historic ministry of the Lord Jesus, in the terrible record of his rejection by his own people, by his own disciples, by the theocratic chiefs, by the assembled Sanhedrin, by the very populace to whom Pilate appealed to save him from murderous fury. But the significance of the prologue is to my mind missed, if the earlier agelong rejection of the ministry, and light of the Logos, nay, the perpetual and awful treatment which he continually receives from "his own possession," be not perceived. There was a Divine and special sense in which the perpetual coming of the Logos to the world was emphasized by his gracious self-manifestations to the people of Israel. The great Name of Jehovah, the Angel of the presence, the manifestations to Abraham, to Moses, to David, to Elijah, to Isaiah, and Ezekiel; the Shechinah glories, the whole ministry of grace to the house of Israel, was a <span class="accented">perpetual coming to his own</span> peculiar possession; but yet the sum total of their history is a continuous repudiation and lapse. They rejected the Lord, they fell in the wilderness, they were turned unto other gods, they went a-whoring after their own inventions. They knew not that God had healed them. The great things of his Law were accounted strange things to them (compare Stephen's apology for an elaborate exposition of this thought). The same kind of treatment has continually been given by the world, and even by those who have boasted of standing in the special lines of his grace. This suggestion cannot he fully expanded here. Chrysostom <span class="accented">in loco</span> calls much attention to the argument of the Epistle to Romans (<a href="../../par/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3, 12</a>).

All have not perished in their unbelief. Some have received him. The twelfth and thirteenth verses do, indeed, in their full meaning, refer unmistakably to the entire ministry of the living Christ to the end of time; but surely every word of it applies <span class="accented">primarily</span> (though not exclusively) to the whole previous pleadings of the Light and Life - to the ministry of the pre-existing and eternal Logos, and to the privileges and possibilities consequent thereupon. <span class="cmt_word">As many as received him</span>. This phrase is subsequently explained as being identical with "believed in his Name." The simple verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is less definite than are its compounds with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, used in the previous verses (5, 11). The acceptance is a positive idea, is broader, more manifold, less restricted as to manner of operation, than the negative rejection which took sharp and decisive form. The construction is irregular. We have a <span class="accented">nominativus pendens</span> followed by a clause in the dative; as much as if he had written, "There are, notwithstanding all the rejections, those who received him." To these, the evangelist says, however many or few they may be, <span class="cmt_word">who believe in his Name,</span> he - the subject of the previous sentence - <span class="cmt_word">gave the authority and capability of becoming children of God</span>. Believing in his Name is discriminated from believing him. The construction occurs thirty-five times in the Gospel, and three times in the First Epistle - and the Name here especially present to the writer is the Logos, the full revelation of the essence, character, and activity, of God. John, writing in the close of his life, surveys a glorious company of individuals who, by realizing as true the sum of all the perfections of the manifested Word, by believing in his Name, have also received as a gift the sense of such union to the Son of God that they become alive to the fact that they too are the offspring of God. This realization of the Divine fatherhood, which had been so obscure before, is itself the  origination within them of filial feeling. Thus a new life is begotten and supervenes upon the old life. This new life is a new humanity within the bosom or womb of the old, and so it corresponds with the Pauline doctrine of new creation and of resurrection. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is more than opportunity, and less than (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) power; it is rightful claim (which is itself the gift of God) to become what they were not before, seeing that a Divine generation has begotten them again. They are born from above. The Spirit of the Son has passed into them, and they cry, "Abba, Father." This Divine begetting is still further explained and differentiated from ordinary human life. The writer distinctly repudiates the idea that the condition he speaks of is a consequence of simple birth into this world. This is done in a very emphatic manner (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;</span> here in the masculine, is the well known <span class="accented">constructio ad sensum</span>, and refers to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Who were begotten from God, not from</span> (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>blood</span>. (The plural word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> has been variously rendered by expositors: Augustine regarding it as a reference to the blending of the blood of both sexes in ordinary generation; Meyer, as not different from the singular in meaning, giving numerous passages in the classics where this or an equivalent usage of the plural for the singular occurs. The suggestion of Moulton is more satisfactory - that it points to pride of race, common enough in Israel, but not peculiar to Jews.) John repudiates for this "generation" any connection with mere hereditary privilege. No twice-born Brahmin, no dignified race, no descendant of Abraham, can claim it as such, and the writer further discriminates it, as though he would leave no loophole for escape: <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet from the will of the flesh, nor even from the will of the man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Some, very erroneously, have supposed that "the flesh" here refers to "woman" in contradistinction to "man," and numerous efforts have been made to point out the threefold distinction. The simplest and most obvious interpretation is that "the will of the flesh" here means the human process of generation on its lower side, and "the will of the man" the higher purposes of the nobler side of human nature, which lead to the same end. Special dignity is conferred by being the son of a special father; but however honoured such might be, as in the case of an Abraham, a David, a Zacharias, such paternity has nothing to do with the sonship of which the evangelist is thinking. Doubtless this triumphant new beginning of humanity can only be found in the full revelation of the name of the incarnate Logos; but surely the primary application of the passage is to the fact that, notwithstanding the stiff-necked rejection of the Logos by the peculiar possession and people of his love, there were, from Abraham to Malachi and to John the Baptist, those who did recognize the Light and live in the love of God. The author of <a href="../../par/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16, 17, 23, 25, 103, 119</a>, and a multitude beyond calculation, discerned and received him, walked in the light of the Lord, were kept in perfect peace, found in the Lord their most exceeding joy. "Like as a father pitieth his chihlren, so the Lord pitied them." He nourished and brought up children, and to the extent to which they appreciated his holy Name they therein received as a gift the capability and claim to call him their Father. This was not a question of human fatherhood or hereditary privilege at all, but of gracious exchanges of affection between these children of his love and the Eternal, who had fashioned them in his image and regenerated them by his Holy Spirit. To restrict any element of this passage to conscious faith in the Christ is to repudiate the activity of the Logos and Spirit before the Incarnation, and almost compels a Sabellian interpretation of the Godhead. Even now the grandeur of the biblical doctrine of the Trinity - a doctrine which treats these relations as eternal and universal - compels us to believe that whenever among the sons of men there is a soul which receives the Logos in this light, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apart from the special revelation of the Logos in the flesh, to such a one he gives the capacity and claim of sonship. John certainly could not mean to imply that there had never been a regenerated soul until he and his fellow disciples accepted their Lord. Up to this point in his argument he has been disclosing the universal and the special operations of the Logos who in the beginning was with God and was God, the Source of all life, the Giver of all light, the veritable Light which shines upon every man, which does more even than that - which made a long continued series of approaches to his own specially instructed and prepared people. Prophecy all through the ages has had a wondrous function to bear witness to the reality of this Light, that all might believe in it, that all might become sons by faith; but, alas darkness, prejudice, depravity, corruption - "darkness" did not apprehend the nature, name, or mystery, of love. And so he proceeds to describe the greatest, the most surprising, supreme energy of the Eternal Logos - that which illustrates, confirms, brings into the most forcible relief, the nature of his personality, and the extent of the obligation under which he has placed the human race; and proves in the most irresistible way, not only the character and nature of God, but the actual condition of humanity. The great extent of the  literature and the imposing controversies which have accumulated over the entirely unique sentence that here fellows render any treatment of it difficult. A volume rather than a page or two is required to exhibit the significance of a verse which is probably the most important collocation of words ever made.

It is enough to regard the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> as a simple copula, after the same manner in which it is used in vers. 1, 4, 5, 10, introducing by it a new and suggestive truth or fact which must be added to what has gone before, qualifying, illumining, illustrating, consummating all previous representations of the activity and functions of the Eternal Logos. Meyer, rejecting all the explicative modifications of the copula, nearly approaches the emphasis which Godet would lay upon it, by saying, "John cannot refrain from expressing the how of that appearing which had such blessed results (vers. 12, 13), and which he had himself experienced." The circumstance that in this verse the author goes back to the verbal use of the great term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> suggests rather the fact that the fourteenth verse follows directly upon the stupendous definitions of ver. 1, and indicates a powerful antithesis to the several clauses of that opening sentence. The Logos which <span class="accented">was</span> in the beginning has now <span class="accented">become</span>; the Logos which was <span class="accented">God</span> became <span class="accented">flesh</span>; the Logos that was <span class="accented">with God</span> has <span class="accented">set up his tabernacle among us.</span> If so, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> does suggest a parenthetical treatment of vers. 2-13, every clause of which has been necessary to prepare the reader for the vast announcement which is here made. Various things, relations, and powers have been asserted with reference to the Logos. All things <span class="accented">became</span> through him; not a single exception is allowed. Not one thing can be, or can have come into existence, independently of him; yet he is not said in any sense to have "become all things." More than that, the twofold form of the expression stringently repudiates the pantheistic hypothesis. All life is said to be "in him," to have its being in his activity; yet he is <span class="accented">not</span> said to have <span class="accented">become life</span>, as if the life-principle were henceforth the mode of his existence, or a state or condition into which he passed, and so the emanation theories of early Gnostics and of modern pantheistic evolutionists are virtually set aside. "The veritable Light which lighteth every man" is the illumination which the <span class="accented">Life</span> pours on the understanding and conscience of men, to which all prophecy bears witness; but he is not said to have <span class="accented">become</span> that light. Thus the incarnation of the Logos in every man is most certainly foreign to the thought of the apostle. He is said to have been "in the world" which he made, yet in such manifestation and concealment that the world as such did not apprehend the wondrous presence; and he is said also to have been continually coming to his own people "in sundry times" and "divers manners," in prophetic visions and angelic and even the anthropic form or fashion. Elsewhere in this Gospel we hear that Abraham "saw his day," and Isaiah "beheld his glory;" but it is not said that he <span class="accented">became, i.e.</span> entered into permanent and unalterable relations with these theophanic glories. Consequently, the deep self-conscious realization of the glory of his Name, enjoyed by greatest saints and sages of the past, was but a faint adumbration of what John declared he and others had had distinct historical opportunity of seeing, hearing, handling, of that Word of life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1, 2</a>). The statement of this verse, however, is entirely, absolutely unique. The thought is utterly new. Strauss tells us that the apostolic conception of Jesus can have no historic validity, because it represents a state of things which occurs nowhere else in history. <span class="accented">This is exactly what Christians contend for.</span> He is in the deepest sense absolutely unique in the history of mankind. Moses, Isaiah, John the Baptist, John the Apostle, Socrates, Buddha, Zoroaster, may have borne witness to the Light; but of not one of them can it be said, and at least it was not said or even imagined by St. John, the Logos became flesh in their humanity. Yet this is what he did think and say was the only explanation of the glory of Jesus; this unspeakable relation to the Eternal Logos was sustained by his well known Friend and Master. And the <span class="accented">Word was made flesh. Flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, answering in the LXX. to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) is the term used to denote the whole of humanity, with prominent reference to that part of it which is the region of sensibility and visibility. The word is more comprehensive than (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) "body," which is often used as the antithesis of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; for it is unquestionable that the conventional use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, includes oftentimes both soul and spirit - includes the whole of human constitution, yet that constitution considered apart from God and grace, answering in this way to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The flesh is not necessarily connotative of sin, though the  conditions, the possibilities, the temptableness of created finite nature are involved in it. It is nearly equivalent to saying <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, generic manhood, but it is more explicit than such a dictum would have been. It is not said that the Word became a man, although "<span class="accented">became man"</span> is the solemn and suggestive form in which the great truth is further expressed in the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed. "<span class="accented">The Logos became flesh."</span> Thus it answers to numerous expressions in the Pauline Epistles, which must have been based in the middle of the first century on the direct and well preserved teachings of our Lord himself (<a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>; Romans 8:3, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>; and above all <a href="../../par/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>, where Jesus Christ, the centre of whose personality is the Logos, and is there used in the most transcendent sense, is there spoken of (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) as having come in the flesh). Very early in the Christological discussions, even so far back as Praxeas whom Tertullian sought to refute, and by Apollinaris the younger, in the fourth century, it was said that this passage asserted that, though the Logos took or became flesh, he did not become or take upon himself the human <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the reasonable soul or spirit of man, but that the Logos took the place in Jesus of the mind or spirit. Apollinaris explained, in vindication of his view, that thus Christ was neither God nor man, but a blending of the two natures into a new and third nature, neither one nor the other. This view was stoutly resisted by Athanasius and Basil. It reappeared in the fifth century, in the form of Eutychianism, to do duty against the twofold Christ of Nestorianism. The opponents of Praxeas, Apollinaris, and Eutyches were all fain to show that the Gospel of John calls marked attention to the human soul of Jesus (<a href="../../par/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>) and of his human spirit (<a href="../../par/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), to say nothing of <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>, where "he learned obedience," etc. The flesh of Christ is constitutive and inclusive of his entire humanity. Flesh itself is not human flesh without the human <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, nor can there be a human soul without human spirit. The two terms are used interchangeably, and their functions are not to be regarded as different factors of humanity so much as different departments of human activity. There is a complete humanity, therefore, included in this term, not a humanity destitute of one of its most characteristic features. But the question arises - What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, "became, was made"? A considerable number of modern Lutheran divines have laid such emphasis on the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the "emptying" of his glory on the part of him who was "in the form of God," that nothing short of an absolute depotentiation of the Logos is supposed to have occurred when "he was made flesh" or "man." Gess and Godet have pressed the theory that the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> represents a complete transubstantiation and metamorphosis. Thus Logos had been God from eternity, but now, in the greatness of his humiliation, he was no longer Logos at all, nor God, but flesh; so that during the time of the Incarnation the Logos was absolutely concealed, potential only, and that even a consciousness of his eternity and the Divine powers were all in absolute abeyance. This hypothesis, on both its Divine and human side, appears to us hopelessly unthinkable. If the Logos was no longer Logos, and the Godhead thus ineffably truncated, the very argument of the apostle that in him was life and light, etc., must break down. The sources of life and light must have been themselves in eclipse, and God himself was no longer God. Moreover, the hypothetical obliteration of the Logos would deprive the whole argument of the apostle for the Divineness and Godhead of the Lord of its basis in fact. There are many different forms in which this meaning of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is urged, but they all break to pieces upon the revelation of the self-consciousness of Jesus Christ, the Divine memories and awful centre of his personality, in which the nature of the Godhead and the perfect nature of manhood are blended in one personality. Moreover, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> does not imply annihilation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or transubstantiation of <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. When the water was made (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) wine, the water was not obliterated, but it took up by the creative power of Christ other substances into itself, constituting it <span class="accented">wine.</span> So when the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> became "flesh," he took up humanity with all its powers and conditions into himself, constituting himself "the Christ." The question arises - Wherein was the humiliation and the <span class="accented">kenosis</span>, if the Logos throughout the incarnate life of Christ, as a Person, possessed and exercised all his Divine energies? The answer is, that, in  taking human nature in its humbled, suffering, tempted form into eternal, absolute union with himself, and by learning through that human nature all that human nature is and fears and needs, there is an infinite fulness of self-humiliating love and sacrifice. Hypostatic union of humanity with the Logos, involving the Logos in the conditions of a complete man, is an infinite humiliation, and seeing that this involved the bitterest conflict and sorrow, brought with it shame, agony, and death, such a stupendous fact is (we believe) assumed to have taken place once in historic time. It is far more than the manifestation in the flesh of Jesus of the Divine light and life. Such an hypothesis would merely consider Jesus as one supereminent display of "the veritable Light which lighteth every man," whereas what is declared by St. John is that the Word himself, after a new exercise of this infinite potency, became flesh. We are not told <span class="accented">how</span> this occurred. The fact of the supernatural birth, as stated by the synoptic writers, is their way of announcing a sublime secret, of which John, who was in the confidence of the mother of Jesus, gave a profounder exposition. In such a fact and event we see what St. Paul meant when he said that in the depths of eternity the infinity of love did not consider the undimmed, unclouded, and unchangeable creative majesty of equality with God to be a prize which must never be relinquished, but emptied himself, was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and was found in fashion as a man. There was now and forevermore a part of his being in such organic union with "flesh" that he could be born, could learn, could be tempted, suffer from all human frailties and privations, die the death of the cross. The phrase, moreover, implies that the Incarnation was in its nature distinct from the Docetic, angelic, transitory manifestations of the older revelation. In the "Word" becoming "flesh" both Word and flesh remain side by side, and neither is the first nor the second absorbed by the other, and so Monophysitism is repudiated, while the statement of what the Word thus incarnate did, viz. "dwelt among us," etc., cuts away the support of the Nestorian division of the Divine and human natures; inasmuch as what is said of the one nature can be said of the other. To this we turn: "And the Word was made flesh, and <span class="cmt_word">set up his tabernacle in our midst</span>." The use of this picturesque word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> points to the tabernacle in the wilderness, in which God dwelt (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>, etc.), and to which reference is made in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>. The localization of Deity, the building a house for the Lord whom the heaven of heavens could not contain, was a wondrous adumbration of the ultimate proof to be given, that, though God was infinitely great, he was yet capable of turning his glorious face upon those who seek him; though unspeakably holy, awful, majestic, omnipotent, he was yet accessible and merciful and able to save and sanctify his people. The glory of the Lord was the central significance of the tabernacle and temple worship. It was always assumed to be present, even if invisible. The Targums in a great variety of passages substitute for the "glory of the Lord," which is a continuous element in the history of the old covenant, the word "Shechinah," "dwelling," and use the term in obvious reference to the biblical use of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, he dwelt, when describing the Lord's familiar and accessible sojourn with his people. It is too much to say that John here adopts the Aramaic phrase, or with certainty refers to it. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> recalls the method by which Jehovah impressed his prophets with his nearness, and came veritably to his own possession. "Now," says John, "the Word made flesh took up his tabernacle in our midst." It is not to be forgotten that John subsequently shows that Jesus identified his body with "the temple" of God (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>, etc.). The "<span class="accented">us"</span> represents the ground of a personal experience which makes the hypothesis of an Alexandrine origin for the entire representation perfectly impossible. The reference to the old covenant is made more conspicuous: <span class="cmt_word">And we contemplated his glory.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> corresponds with the visible manifestations of the presence of Jehovah under the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). Dazzling light at the burning bush, in the pillar of fire, on Mount Sinai, at the dedication of tabernacle and temple, etc., revealed the awful fact of the Divine nearness. The eye of believing men saw the real glory of the Logos made flesh when he set up the tabernacle of his humanity among us. It does not follow that all eyes must have seen what the eye of faith could see. The darkness has resisted all the light, the world has not known the Logos; the susceptibilities of believing men enabled them to perceive the glory of the Lord in regions and by a mode of presentation to which unregenerate men have not attained. The apostles saw it in the absolute moral perfection of his holiness and of his charity; of his grace and truth. We can scarcely exclude here a reference to the wondrous vision upon which (as we learn from Matthew, Mark, Luke) John himself gazed on the Mountain of Transfiguration, when the venerable symbol of <span class="accented">Light</span> reappeared from within the person of the Lord, so linking his personal  manifestation of "the Word" with the theophanies of the Old Testament; nor can we forget the sublime vision which John undoubtedly records in the beginning of his Apocalypse. Nevertheless, the glory which the apostles beheld must be distinct from the "glory" which he had with the Father before the world was, and to which (<a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>) he prayed that he might return, and the full radiance of which he would ultimately turn upon the eyes of the men whom he had gathered "out of the world." Before that consummation "we," says he, "contemplated his glory <span class="cmt_word">as of an only begotten</span>." The <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> implies comparison with the transcendent conception which had entered into his inspired imagining. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is used by John to refer to the supreme and unique relation of the Son to the Father (<a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 18</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>). It is used of human sons in Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-12.htm">Luke 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-42.htm">Luke 8:42</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-38.htm">Luke 9:38</a>), and <span class="accented">unigenitus</span> is the translation in the Vulgate of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, where the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, well beloved (see <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2, 12, 16</a>). It corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>, showing that an analogous thought filled the apostolic mind. By laying stress here on the "glory," and giving historic value and emphasis to the supernatural conception of Jesus, many see in this a reference to the Incarnation wherein he became an only begotten Son of the Father. This would be far more probable if the article had been placed before <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>. Here the apostle seems to labour to express the glory of One who could thus stand in the eternal relation of the Logos to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, making it correspond with the relation also subsisting between <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and the "Father." Great speciality and peculiarity is here bestowed upon the "only begotten," as it stands in close relationship with those to whom he gives power or capability to become "children of God." They are born into the family of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The glory which John says "we beheld" in his earthly flesh was the effulgence of the uncreated beam which broke through the veil of his flesh, and really convinced us that he was "the Word made flesh." The Tubingen critics see a contradiction here with the prayer of Christ (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>) for "the glory which he had with the Father." If he shone on earth with such glory as John here describes, why should he desire more? Godet resolves it by insisting on the moral glory of his filial consciousness when he had indeed deprived himself of his Divine perfections. Thus Godet repudiates the two natures of his Person. There is no real contradiction, as we have seen. Some difference of opinion occurs also as to the reference of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Some nave referred <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> to the <span class="accented">Father</span>, and some to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>, though in both cases a break in the construction would be involved, as the antecedent would have been in the genitive. Others, again (founding on the reading of one uncial manuscript, D, which here has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;</span>), refer it to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and all who thus construe eschew any parenthetical treatment of the previous clause. The latter method is freer from difficulty, as then this clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is directly and grammatically related with <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Word was made flesh, and, full of grace and of truth, set up his tabernacle in our midst. Grace and truth are the two methods by which the glory as of "an only begotten" shone upon us, and we beheld it. The combination of these two ideas of grace and truth pervades the Old Testament description of the Lord (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>). "Grace," the free and royal communication of unlooked for and of undeserved love, is the keynote of the New Testament. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ" is the compendium of all his powers of benediction, and corresponds with the <span class="accented">life</span> which is "in him," and all the gift of himself to those who came into contact with him. "Truth" is the expression of the thought of God. Truth <span class="accented">per se</span> can find no larger definition than the perfect revelation of God's eternal thought concerning himself and his universe, and concerning the relations of all things to each other and to him. That which God thinks about these things must be "truth <span class="accented">per se."</span> Christ claimed to be "the Truth" and "the Life" (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and John here says that it was in virtue of his being the Logos of God that he was full of these. Grace and truth, love and revelation, were so transcendent in him; in other words, he was so full, so charged, so overflowing with both, that the glory which shone from him gave apostles this conception about it, viz. that it was that of an only begotten (specially and eternally begotten) and with the Father. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> of ch. 17:5, and does not, therefore, necessarily suggest more than the premundane condition, answering to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 1, and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 18. Erasmus, Paulus, and a few others have associated the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., with the following verse. This is eminently unsatisfactory as unsuited to the character of the Baptist. Moreover, the sixteenth verse, by its reference to Christ's "fulness," positively forbids it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The testimony to this fact by the prophetic spirit.</span> The evangelist, in support and vindication of the profound impression produced upon himself and others by the Christ, cites the startling and  paradoxical testimony of the Baptist, which in John's own hearing the great forerunner had twice uttered, under very extraordinary circumstances (see vers. 26, 30). In the later verses this testimony is put in its proper place. Its repetition deepens the impression which the narrative gives of the vivid reality, and of the fact that the evangelist was trusting to a strongly impressed recollection, and is not romanticizing, as the Tubingen critics suppose. The sharp paradoxical form is thoroughly characteristic of the man who called on scribes and Pharisees to "repent," and spoke of God raising up seed to Abraham from the stones of the ground. From the synoptists we learn that John declared that the Coming One was "mightier" than himself, would deal with the Holy Ghost and with fire as he was able to do with water. He knew not the kind of manifestation which was coming on apace. But an enormous change passed over John the Baptist when he came into contact with our Lord, and at his baptism he sank abashed before the revelations which flashed on his soul. The enigmatical form of the Baptist's utterances was the beginning of the evangelist's faith in the personal pre-existence of the Logos who had become flesh in Christ. The testimony of the Baptist is here brought in, as the last great word of the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament, apart from the historic setting in which it afterwards occurs, as if, moreover, it was an abiding word which was yet sounding in the ears of men. The greatest of the sons of woman, and "more than a prophet," he who gathered up in his immense personality all the functions of prophet, priest, Nazarite, and master and teacher of men, the Elijah of the new revelation - John, the very ideal of Divine and supernatural voice in this world of ours, John, the veritable historic man, moreover, to whose disastrous martyrdom some of the Jews (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18, 5, 2) referred the terrible judgments that befell their nation - <span class="cmt_word">John</span> <span class="cmt_word">beareth witness</span>. That was his function, and his testimony still stands, his "voice" is still heard wherever his great career is known or properly appreciated - in Palestine, in Alexandria, in Ephesus or Corinth. And <span class="cmt_word">he crieth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); or, <span class="accented">hath cried</span>; and the cry is still heard among men: <span class="cmt_word">This was he of whom I spake</span>; implying that John uttered words of strange enigmatical significance before he saw Jesus coming to his baptism, and that, as the evangelist subsequently shows, on two memorable occasions, the prophet recalled them and reaffirmed their truthfulness. Before I saw him, I said it: <span class="cmt_word">He that is coming after me hath become</span> - hath been in mighty activity - <span class="cmt_word">before me</span>. He came forth in many ways from the Father, and was the central reality of the old covenant; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he hath come in the voice of the Lord, in the Shechinah glory, in the Angel of the <span class="accented">presence</span>, chronologically "before me." The English Version has followed the traditionary interpretation from Chrysostom to Lucke, De Wette, Alford, McLellan, and has seen in this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> a reference to the higher rank or dignity of the Logos <span class="accented">incarnate</span>, and translated the second clause "is preferred before me," or "hath been made before me," etc. But such a statement would not have conveyed any thought of great importance. A herald is naturally exceeded and superseded by the dignity and rank of him for whom he prepares the way. Moreover, the two adverbs of place are used in metaphorical sense as adverbs of time (derived from the relative position of individuals in a line or procession), and it is scarcely probable that the second should be used in another sense altogether, which would have disturbed the antithesis between them. On the other hand, Hengstenberg, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc., recognize the perception of the Baptist, and his utterance of belief in the pre-existence of the Christ, and that from such passages as <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> he knew that he who was coming into the world, and about to baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire, to take the fan in his hand, etc., had been in reality <span class="accented">before him.</span> The difficulty of this interpretation is said to be that the proof which follows - <span class="cmt_word">because</span>, or <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>he was before me</span> - would be tautologous in the extreme; the reason given for the Lord having become before him being simply the asseveration of the fact. But the two very remarkable expressions, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;</span>, are not identical. The first may easily refer to the historic precedence of the activity of the Coming One in all the operations of the Logos; the second may refer to the absolute and eternal precedence of the Logos in itself. If so, the whole significance of the previous fourteen verses is gathered up, and shown to have been flashed upon the consciousness of John the Baptist, and uttered with such intensity that the evangelist caught the idea, and saw in it the key to the whole mystery. It would seem, however, that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> did not form  part of the original utterance of John. After the baptism, the whole truth had broken upon the Baptist, and he clenched or saw an explanation of the mystery. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> <span class="accented">The experience of the Writer.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - There can be little doubt that the fifteenth verse is a parenthetical clause, answering to the sixth and seventh verses, and standing to ver. 14 very much in the same kind of relation that vers. 6, 7 do to vers. 1-5. There is a further reason; the verses which follow are clearly not, as Lange suggests, the continuance of the Baptist's <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, but the language of the evangelist, and a detail of his personal experience. The entire context would entirely forbid our taking the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of ver. 16 as referring to the Baptist. This is still more evident from the true reading of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in place of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>. The "because" points back at once to the statements of ver. 14. Hengstenberg and Godet think there is no need to transform the fifteenth verse into a parenthesis, in order, after the recital of John the Baptist's testimony, to proceed to a further experience of the evangelist; translating "<span class="accented">and even</span>," Lange makes the whole utterance to be that of the Baptist, which appears to be profoundly inconsistent with the position of the Baptist, either then or subsequently. The grand declaration, that the Logos incarnate was "full of grace and truth," is justified by the author of the prologue, from his conscious experience of the exhaustless plenitude of the manifestation. <span class="cmt_word">Because from his fulness we all received.</span> He speaks as from the bosom of a society of persons, who have not been dependent on vision or on individual contact with the historic revelation (comp. ch. 20, "Blessed are they [Jesus said] who have not seen [touched or handled], and yet have believed," but have nevertheless discovered a perennial supply of grace and truth in him). We all, my fellow apostles and a multitude which no man can number, received from this source, as from the Divinity itself, all that we have needed. An effort has been made, from the evangelist's use of the word <span class="accented">pleroma</span>, to father the "prologue" upon one familiar with the Valentinian metaphysic, and thus to postpone its origin to the middle of the second century; but the Valentinian <span class="accented">pleroma</span> is the sum total of the Divine emanations of the thirty pairs of aeons, which have been produced from the eternal "bythos," or abyss, one only of which is supposed, on Valentinian principles, to have assumed a phantasmic form in Jesus Christ. Nothing could be less resembling the position of the author of this Gospel, who clearly regards the Logos incarnate as coincident with the fulness of the Godhead, as containing in himself, in complete self-possession, all the energies and beneficence of the Eternal. With the apostle's doctrine of the Logos as identical with God, as the Creator of everything, as the Life, as the Light of men; and, as becoming the Source of all these energies to men in his incarnation, there is no basis for Valentinianism. Though the phraseology of the Gnostics was borrowed in part from the Gospel, and though Valentinus may have fancied himself justified in his misuse of texts; the ideas of the Gospel and the Gnostic were directly contradictory of one another (see Introduction). Long before John used this word, St. Paul had used it in writing to the Ephesiaus and Colossians, as though, even in his day, the word had acquired a distinct theological meaning, and one that had naturally arisen from its etymology and usage in Greek writers. Bishop Lightfoot has shown in his dissertation ('Epistle to Colossians,' 2nd edit., pp. 257-273) that the form of the word demands a passive sense, <span class="accented">id quod impletur</span>, and not an active one which some have given to it in certain New Testament passages, as if it had the meaning of <span class="accented">id quod implet.</span> By his examination of numerous passages, he shows that it always has fundamentally the sense of <span class="accented">completeness</span>, "<span class="accented">the full complement</span>," <span class="accented">the plenitude.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the passive verbal from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, to make complete. Thus <a href="../../par/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>, "The Father was pleased that all the fulness, the totality, should dwell in him," explained elsewhere in the same Epistle, "all the completeness, the plenitude of the Godhead" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). The widespread diffusion of the idea of emanations, the hypostatizing of perfections and attributes, the virtual mythology which was creeping through metaphysical subtleties even into Judaism and Christianity, demanded positive repudiation; and, while the whole Church was united in its recognition of the Divine energy of Christ, it became needful to refer to his Divine-human personality all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. In Ephesians St. Paul speaks, however, of the Church which is his body as identified with him, and as (in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>) a bride made one flesh with her husband, without spot or wrinkle, ideally perfect, as the part of one colossal individuality of which Christ is the Head; or, the one building of which he is the Foundation and the Cornerstone. Hence "the fulness of Christ"  (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>) is that in which every member participates, and "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" is equated with the perfect humanity into which all believers come. Hence in <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a> these individuals are completed in him, and are thus as a whole, by the realization of their union to Christ, participators in the fulness of God. So the difficult expression, <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>, becomes explained, a passage in which the Church itself, his body, is said to be "the fulness of him who filleth all in all." The Church is the organ and sphere in which all the Divine graces are poured, and is considered as ever struggling to embody the ideal perfection of him in whom all the fulness of God dwells. Both ideas, those of both the Christological Epistles, are involved in this great assertion of St. John. <span class="cmt_word">And grace for grace.</span> It is said the evangelist might have written <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, grace in addition to grace received already; but the use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, implies more, "grace interchanging with grace" (Meyer) - not the grace of the old covenant replaced by the grace of the new dispensation (Chrysostom, Lampe, and many others), for, though there was grace underlying all God's self-revelation, yet in the next verse the contrast between "Law" and "grace" is too striking to be ignored. The grace replaced by grace means that every grace received is a capacity for higher blessedness. Thus Christian humility is the condition of Divine uplifting; the knowledge that leads to love is the condition of that higher gnosis that is born of love. The faith that accepts mercy blossoms into the joy that is unspeakable and full of glory. Reconciliation with God becomes itself transformed into active communion with him; all union to Christ becomes the harbinger of full identification with him, "he in us and we in him." This is the great principle of the Divine kingdom: "To him that hath shall be given." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">For the law was given by Moses, <i>but</i> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is sustained by calling attention to the contrast between the two methods of Divine communication. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Law was given through Moses;</span> "Law," which in Paul's writings had been even looked at by itself as an "antithesis to grace" (<a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). The Law principle of approach to God fails through the weakness of the flesh. The will is too far enslaved for it to yield spontaneously to the majesty of the Lawgiver, or to feel the attractions of obedience. The Law condemns, - it is incapable of justifying the ungodly: the Law terrifies, - it never reconciles. The Law even provokes to sin and excites the passions which it punishes. Law was <span class="accented">given</span> through Moses, pointing to the historic fact of the pomp and splendour of its first delivery, associated therefore with the greatest human name in all past history. Law was a "gift," a Divine bestowment of entirely unspeakable value to those who were ignorant of the mind and will of God. Even the ministration of death was glorious. The knowledge of an ideal perfection is a great advance, even though no power should accompany the ideal to draw the soul towards it. To know what is right, even without help to do it, save in the form of sanction, or penalty appealing to the lower nature, is better and nobler than to sin in utter ignorance. The Law was given "<span class="accented">through"</span> the mind, voice, conscience, and will of Moses. And alongside of him may be supposed to be ranged all the mighty sages and legislators of the human race - all who have thus been the mouthpiece of the Divine idea, all who have impressed the "ought" and "ought not," the "shall" and "shall not," upon mankind. Moses is not the <span class="accented">author</span> of the Law, the "giving" of the Law was not <span class="accented">by</span> Moses, but <span class="accented">through</span> his instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">Grace and truth,</span> however, <span class="cmt_word">came</span> - became, passed into activity in human nature - <span class="cmt_word">through Jesus Christ.</span> For "grace and truth" (see notes, ver. 14), the highest manifestation and self-communication of Divine love and Divine thought, came into human experience through Jesus Christ. A vast and wonderful contrast is here made between all earlier or other dispensations and that of which the apostle proceeds to speak. Divine favour and help, the life of God himself in the soul of man, awakening love in response to the Divine love; and Divine thought so made known as to bring all the higher faculties of man into direct contact with reality, are an enormous advance upon Lawgiving. The appropriate human response to Law is obedience; the appropriate human response to love is of the same nature with itself - nothing less than love; so the only adequate response to Divine truth is faith; to Divine thought may follow human thought. All this forth streaming of grace and truth originated in the person of <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, and became possible through him. This great <span class="accented">Name</span>, this blending of the human and Divine, of saving grace and Messianic dignity, of ancient expectations and recent realization, is only twice more used in the Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a> and John 20:31); but it pervades it throughout, and, though not actually said to be equivalent to the <span class="accented">Word made flesh</span>, yet no shadow of doubt is left that this was the apostle's meaning. Here the full significance of the prologue really bursts into view to one who reads it for the first time (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>). Difficulty may be felt by some as to the actual Capacity of Jesus Christ to reveal the Divine thought, or <span class="accented">the truth</span>, and so the closing verse of the prologue  vindicates the claim of the Saviour of the world to be the truth (cf. <a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <i>him</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No one hath ever yet seen God.</span> Many visions, theophanies, appearances, angelic splendours, in the desert, on the mountain, in the temple, by the river of Chebar, had been granted to the prophets of the Lord; but they have all fallen short of the direct intuition of God as God. Abraham, Israel, Moses, Manoah, David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, saw visions, local manifestations, anticipations of the Incarnation; but the apostle here takes the Lord's own word for it (<a href="../../par/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>), and he elsewhere repeats it (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>). These were but forerunners of the ultimate manifestation of the Logos. "The Glory of the Lord," "the Angel of the Lord," "the Word of the Lord," were not so revealed to patriarchs that they saw God as God. They saw him in the form of light, or of spiritual agency, or of human ministries; but in the deepest sense we must still wait for the purity of heart which will reveal to our weakened faculties the beatific vision. <span class="cmt_word">The only begotten Son</span> - or, (God <span class="accented">only begotten</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">who is in</span> (or, <span class="accented">on</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the bosom of the Father, he interpreted</span> (him); became the satisfying Exposition, the Declarer, drawing forth from the depths of God all that it is  possible that we shall see, know, or realize. This lofty assertion is augmented by the sublime intensification of the earlier phrase, "with God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)," by (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "in or on the bosom of the Father;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in most intimate and loving fellowship with the Father as the only begotten. The relations of fatherhood and sonship within the substance of the Godhead give new life, warmth, realization, to the vaster, colder, more metaphysical, metaphenomenal relations of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. here <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-30.htm">Proverbs 8:30</a>). Bengel here says, "In lumbis esse dicuntur qui nascentur homines, in sinu sunt qui nati sunt. In sinu Patris erat Filius, quia nunquam non-natus." In view of the contention of Meyer that the language here refers to no age long, eternal indwelling of the Logos with, or of the Son (God only begotten) on the bosom of, the Father, but to the exaltation of the Christ after his ascension, we can only refer to the present tense (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>), which from the standpoint of the prologue does not transfer itself to the historical standpoint of the writer at the end of the first century. Lange thinks that the whole of this wonderful utterance is attributed by the evangelist to the Baptist; but the standing of the Baptist, lofty as it is in John's Gospel, after the Baptist came into brief fellowship with the One who was before him, certainly falls short of this insight into his eternal Being. John the beloved disciple could thus speak of the revelation and interpretation of God which was made in the life, words, and death of the Only Begotten, from whose fulness he had received "grace for grace;" but in this verse he is speaking of the timeless condition, the eternal fellowship, of the Only Begotten with the Father, as justifying the fulness of the revelation made in his incarnation. The prologue forms a key to the entire Gospel. It may have been written after the record of the central principles involved in the life work of Jesus had been completed. Every statement in it may be seen to be derived from the recorded words or acts of the Lord, the revelation of the Father in time, the unveiling of the eternal heart of him who made all things, and by one competent to speak of both eternities. The writer of the prologue speaks of himself as one of a group or society who had had ocular evidence of the perfection and glory of the manifestation. This fellowship of men had found themselves children of God, and in the possession of a life, a light, and a hope which were derived entirely from <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, who is undoubtedly in a unique sense declared (though not formally defined) to be "the Word made flesh." In the subsequent narrative we find a graduated series of instructions on the powers of Christ and the opposition of the world to his self-manifestation. Thus (ch. 1.) the testimony of the Baptist (made after his contact with Christ) to the Person and work of the Lord attributes to him, on prophetic authority, most stupendous functions - those of baptizing with the Holy Spirit, and taking away the sin of the world. He does himself reveal the way to the Father. He is hailed as the "Christ," the "King of Israel," and as the link between heaven and earth, between the invisible and visible, the Divine and the human (<a href="../../par/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>). In ch. 2, with all its other suggestiveness, Christ displays his creative power, and (cf. ch. 6.) his relation to the world of things, as well as his organic relation to the old covenant. In ch. 2 his "body" is the "temple" of God, where his Father dwelt, thus justifying the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 14. The pre-existence of Christ as a self-conscious personality in the very substance of Deity is asserted by himself in <a href="../../par/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>. The fact that he is the Source of all <span class="accented">life</span> (<a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), is involved in the teaching of the Gospel from end to end. Eternal life is ministered through him, to believers (<a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, etc., John 3:36). He claims to have life in himself (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). He is the "Bread of life" for starving humanity (<a href="../../par/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35, 48</a>). The words that he speaks are spirit and <span class="accented">life</span> (<a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). In <a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a> the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> links the idea of life and light as they are shown to cohere in the prologue. In <a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a> he declares himself to be "the Truth and the Life," thus sustaining the great generalization. By raising Lazarus he is portrayed  as the Restorer of forfeited life, as well as the original Giver of life to men (<a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). The ninth chapter records the symbolic event by which he proved himself to be the Sun of the spiritual universe, "the Light of the world" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a> with John 8:12; cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36, 46</a>). The whole history of the conflict with the people whom he came to save, with "his own," with the world power, and the death doom, is the material which is generalized in the solemn statements of <a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-10</a>. The prologue says nothing in express words of Christ's supernatural conception, of his death, or of his resurrection and eternal glory; yet these objective facts are woven through, and involved in, the entire context, for the incarnation of the Eternal Word is the historic basis of the apostle's experience of such a life as that which he proceeds to sketch. The absolute antagonism of the darkness to the light, and the rejection of the light and life by the world, never had such exposition as that which the repudiation and crucifixion of the Son of God gave to them; while the eternal nature of the central life and being of him who, when incarnate, was thus resisted by unbelief renders the resurrection and ultimate and eternal glory a necessity of thought even to these who have not yet seen, but yet have believed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-34.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">The testimony of the Baptist.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The historic narrative commences with the nineteenth verse of the chapter. The scene is laid after the ministry of John had reached its climax in the baptism of Jesus - an event presupposed and implied, but not described. John's ministry had produced the most amazing excitement among the people. They had flocked to his side and to his baptism, confessing their sins; they had heard his summons to repentance; they had trembled under his threats of judgment; they had received their appropriate message from the inspired seer. His prophetic indignation against their selfishness and greed, their formalism, and their boast of covenanted immunity from the consequences of moral fault, had roused conscience into preternatural activity. The wail of concern and the excitement of alarmed inquiry had as yet only secured from John the promise of another Teacher, of Another, mightier than he, whose fan was in his hand, who would test, divide, save, and punish. When the Christ came himself to this baptism, came confessing the sins of the whole world, came with awful holiness and yet infinite sympathy for the sorrows and perils of the people, to fulfil all righteousness, a new revelation was made to John. The voice from heaven, the symbol of the Holy Spirit which descended and abode upon him, brought John into a new world. He was as one dazed and bewildered by excess of light. The abundance of the revelations became a new test of his own mission, and a new explanation to him of what his purpose in the world had really been. The contrast between the ministry of John as detailed by the synoptists and the Fourth Gospel is explicable so soon as we observe that the latter takes up the career of John where the former had laid it down. Here, consequently, is a chapter in John's history concerning which the synoptists are silent. When the baptism of Jesus was accomplished, and the Spirit had led him away into the wilderness, John stood, much as Elisha might have done (in the very same region) when Elijah went heavenwards in a chariot of fire. But he proceeded to testify new and strange things about his kinsman. The effect of his ministry was, for the time, greatly augmented by the suspense and expectation of some rapidly approaching manifestation. In the midst of the excitement thus produced we learn from this verse: <span class="cmt_word">And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent</span> (<span class="cmt_word">to him</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from Jerusalem priests and Levites, that,</span> etc. The copula "and" shows how the narrative roots itself in the prologue, and points back to the citation already made from John's words. In ver. 15 they were introduced apart from their historical connection as the summation of the highest and most fruitful mission of the Baptist. Now the precise antecedents which give to them special weight are set forth. "This" is the predicate of the sentence. The occasion referred to is when "the Jews" sent their deputation. The evangelist is accused of always using the term, "the Jews," in a sense that is hostile to them, and thus an argument has been framed against the authenticity of the Gospel. It is true that John uses this term far more frequently than the synoptists (Matthew five times, Mark seven times, Luke five times), for it is found more than seventy times in his Gospel; but it is not exclusively used in a depreciatory sense  (see <a href="../../par/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33</a>). For the most part he uses the term (now denotative of the entire people, though formerly confined to the tribe of Judah) for the theocratic nation which had ceased, when he composed his Gospel, to have any political existence. More than this, in a vast number of texts he rises the term for the authoritative powers of the nation rather than of the people. According to the narrative of each of the Gospels, the theocratic people displayed, by its highest representatives and ruling powers, rancorous hatred and calculated antagonism to the Son of God. (See Introduction for proof that, notwithstanding this separation of the evangelist's mind from them, he must have been a Palestinian Jew himself.) The Jews, the ecclesiastical party, sent a deputation of priests and Levites from Jerusalem, which consisted, as we learn from the twenty-third verse, "of the Pharisees." They came to make a legitimate inquiry from the new prophet. There is no trace of malignity or antagonism in this act. They would learn from his own lips who he was, what character or functions he was sustaining. A similar deputation approached our Lord at a later period, when all their jealousy and hatred had been aroused. There was, however, no better way in which they could learn the facts of the case. The <span class="accented">Sanhedrin</span>, or great council of seventy-one members, the elders, high priests (including ex-high priests), and scribes, is variously described. There is no early trace anterior to the time of Antipater and Herod of this body as thus constituted, but it was doubtless formed upon the basis of the older institution of the seventy eiders (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>),or of the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the Books of Maccabees (1 Macc. 12:6; 2 Macc. 1:10). It is probable (Hengstenberg) that the Levites here mentioned by John represent those who in the other Gospels are described as "scribes," or students of the Law, belonging to the sacred tribe, though not to the family of Aaron. The absence of any reference to the Levites in Matthew and Mark (<a href="../../par/luke/10-32.htm">Luke 10:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), and the frequent occurrence of "scribes," make it probable that the profession of the Law was specially followed by the remnant of the tribe of Levi (but see Schurer, 'Jewish People in Time of Christ,' &sect;&sect; 24, 25). The deputation came to receive and convey to those that sent them definite replies to certain questions. In <a href="../../par/luke/3-15.htm">Luke 3:15</a> there is said to have been a widespread impression that John the Baptist was supposed to be the Christ of their popular expectation. Such a portentous claim must be sifted by them without delay. They were <span class="cmt_word">sent that they should put the question to him; Who art thou?</span> John's profession of a baptizer, and his implied teaching that "Pharisees and Sadducees," the covenanted, sacramental people, needed cleansing and admission by some sacred rite into a fellowship more holy than that of the theocratic nation itself, demanded, immediate examination; and they were justified by the letter of the Law in making the inquiry (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-20.htm">John 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">He deflates his own position, negatively.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he confessed, and denied not</span>. Perhaps the double form of statement, or rather the introduction of the clause, "he denied not," before the repetition of the confession with its contents, was adopted to indicate that John might have been tempted to "deny" that he was <span class="accented">not</span> the Christ. If he had hesitated at all, he would have denied the real Christ, the Son of God, who had been revealed to him by special means. <span class="cmt_word">I for my part</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">am</span> <span class="cmt_word">not the Christ.</span> This implies, not only that the supposition over which they are brooding is unfounded, not only that he is not the Christ, but that he knows more, and that he knows another to be the Christ. If this reading of the text is correct, the Baptist, by his negative reply, gave to the priests more than they asked. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they asked him, What then?</span> What is the state of the case? The very repudiation of Messiahship in this form seems to imply some association with the Messianic period of which they had so many conflicting ideas. Malachi (<a href="../../par/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>) had predicted the coming again from heaven of Elijah the prophet, and the LXX., by translating the passage "Elijah the Tishbite," had strengthened the common mistake of a metempsychosis, or such an abnormal manifestation before the coming of Messiah. Schottgen ('De Messia,' H.H., vol. 2, pp 226, 490, 533-537) quotes a variety of proofs of this anticipation, and that Elijah was expected "<span class="accented">three</span> days before Messiah; that he would come in the mountains of Israel, weeping over the people, saying, 'O land of Israel, how long will you remain arid and desolate!'" (cf. my 'John the Baptist,' 3. &sect; 4). There was a true sense in which (as our Lord informed his disciples) John was the fulfilment of Malachi's prediction and of the language of the angel to Zacharias (<a href="../../par/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-12.htm">Matthew 17:12</a>), and that John came veritably in the spirit and power of Elijah. In that sense "Elijah had come already," just as Christ their <span class="accented">David</span> had come, in fulfilment of Ezekiel's  vision (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), to rule over them. In the physical, superstitious sense, John the son of Zacharias was not the reincarnation of the Prophet Elijah, and so he boldly answered the inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou Elijah?</span> with a categorical negative: I am not. They press their question once more. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the Prophet?</span> It is doubtful whether they here take up another popular expectation of the physical return of one of the old prophets, or whether, with an exegesis afterwards modified by the apostles, they point to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and reveal the fact that they had not identified the prediction of "the prophet like unto Moses" with their Messiah. If they <span class="accented">had</span> identified these representations, they would not, of course, have pressed him with an identical question. It is highly probable that <span class="accented">that</span> prophecy had, with the predictions of Malachi and Isaiah, led to numerous expectations more or less identified with the Messianic cycle of coming events. In <a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>, we see the prevalence of the expectation - of a longing for an old prophet. They yearned for no upstart, but for one of the mighty brotherhood of departed men, in veritable flesh and blood. Now John and now Jesus was crudely suspected by some to be such a resuscitation. The Baptist, like the Samaritan woman, and subsequently St. Peter when full of the Holy Ghost, had sharply identified "the Prophet like unto Moses" with the Messiah himself; and therefore, on either hypothesis, he gives a curt reply to this inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">and he answered, No.</span>

The Baptist quoted from <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> two sentences; the synoptists cite the whole passage, as finding abundant realization in the mission of John. The prophet felt that the work he had to perform entirely concealed the importance of his own personality. He lost himself in his office and in his message. Isaiah, when foreseeing the revival of the nation, then wandering in a spiritual "wilderness," along rugged ridges, savage precipices, stony gorges, of a symbolic desert, anticipated the return of the Jehovah to his own sanctuary, and declared that ample prophetic preparation was needed, so that the people, by repentance and reformation, might understand that Israel had received double for all her sins. "Hark!" says he, "a crier, or a voice." The herald has gone forth to break the silence that lay between the land of captivity and the land of promise. "In the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord." Israel was to see that there was neither self-righteousness nor moral rebellion to impede the approach of One who was mighty to save. A portion of this very oracle is quoted by Malachi when he exclaims, "Behold, I send my messenger before my face, who shall prepare the way before me." This "messenger before the face of the Lord" is no other than he who should come in the spirit and power of Elijah. John, therefore, gathered up the significance of both prophecies, when he spoke of himself as "a voice crying in the wilderness [actual and symbolical], Make straight the way of the Lord." The Hebrew text, as we have translated it above, associates the words, "in the wilderness," with "make straight." rather than with "the voice crying." The quotation by the evangelist from the LXX. will suffer either arrangement of the words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-24.htm">John 1:24</a></div><div class="verse">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they</span>  <span class="cmt_word">had been sent from the Pharisees,</span> which amounts to the same thing as "they which were sent were of the Pharisees," and it is after the manner of John to introduce explanatory, retrospective comment, which may throw light on what follows (vers. 41, 45; <a href="../../par/john/4-30.htm">John 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>). The  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> of the following verse shows that we have still to do with the same deputation. The Pharisees were accustomed to lustral rites, but had legal points to make as to the authority of any man who dared to impose them upon the sacred nation, and especially on their own section, which made its special boast of ceremonial exactitude and purity. They might justify an old prophet, or the Elijah of Malachi, and still more the Christ himself, should he call men to baptismal cleansing. But the dim mysterious "voice in the wilderness," even if John could prove his words, had no such prescriptive claim. The Pharisaic priests and Levites would take strong views on the baptismal question, and even exalt it into a more eminent place in their thoughts than the fundamental question, "Art thou the very Christ?" The same confusion of essential and accidental elements of religious truth and life was not confined to old Pharisees.

Some have laid great emphasis on the limitation which John assigns to his baptism. It is said he thus anticipated the contrast afterwards expressed between it and the Spirit baptism of Jesus. This is. however, reserved for a later utterance. The baptism with water inaugurated the Messianic kingdom, prepared the people to receive the <span class="accented">Lord.</span> If, then, Messiah were reasonably expected thus to create a fellowship of those, who, substituted this simple lustration for a cumbrous cycle of ceremonial purifications, John, as the "voice," the "herald," the "crier" in the wilderness, was justified in administering the rite. <span class="cmt_word">I baptize with water, seeing that there</span> <span class="cmt_word">standeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (<span class="cmt_word">whom you know not</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who is coming after me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to loose.</span> This standing in the very crowd before him of the Mightier than John, now being searched out as it were by the glances of the Baptist, and recognized by him as One over whom the heavens had opened, gave ample support to the Baptist in his baptismal functions. The One coming after John, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after," because of John's chronological precedence in showing himself to Israel, is yet of such lofty rank and mighty power that John is not fit in his own opinion to be his humblest slave. This solemn assurance justifies to the Sanhedrin the preparatory rite. This closes the first great testimony. Before proceeding to the second, the evangelist supplies a geographical hint, which up to the present day has not been satisfactorily interpreted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-27.htm">John 1:27</a></div><div class="verse">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a></div><div class="verse">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was</span> <span class="cmt_word">baptizing</span>.  The fact that John the Baptist,  in the previous verses, recognizes the Messiah, and that in vers. 31-33 he declares that knowledge to have followed the baptism and the sign then given to him, makes it obvious that the baptism and the forty days of the temptation are now in the past. Every day is clearly marked from the day on which the deputation from the Sanhedrin approached him, till we find Jesus at Cana, on his way to Jerusalem. Consequently, the baptism of Christ, which was the occasion of the higher knowledge that John acquired concerning him, as well as the temptation, had been consummated. Of this last it would seem highly probable John had received, in subsequent conversation with the Lord, a full report. The Lord had passed through the fiery ordeal. He had accepted the position of the Servant of the Lord, who, in the way of privation, suffering, fierce antagonism from world, flesh, and devil, would win the crown of victory and prove himself to be the Life and Light of the world. This chronological hint appears to me to explain the sudden and surprising utterance of the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a></div><div class="verse">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the following day.</span> Next after the day on which the Sanhedrin had heard from John the vindication of his own right to baptize in virtue of the commencement of the Messiah's ministry, which as yet was concealed from all eyes but his own. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> [<span class="cmt_word">John</span> ] <span class="cmt_word">seeth Jesus coming towards him,</span> within reach of observation (certainly not, as Ewald and others have imagined, to be baptized of him, for, as we have seen, the statements of ver. 33 exclude the possibility of such a purpose. The design of Jesus is not stated. The evangelist is here occupied with the testimony of the Baptist to Christ. Enough is said to provide the opportunity for the most wonderful and mysterious utterances of the forerunner. Behold (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> in the singular, although several persons are addressed, is not unusual; see <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a> and <a href="../../par/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</span> We should observe, from the later context, that already John had perceived by special signs and Divine inspiration that Jesus was the Son of God, and the veritable Baptizer with the Holy Ghost; that he was before him in dignity, honour, and by pre-existence, although his earthly ministry had been delayed until  after John's preparatory work had been done. John had felt that the "confession of sins" made by the guilty multitude, by generations of vipers, was needful, rational, imperative upon <span class="accented">them</span>; but that in the case of Jesus this confession was not only superfluous, but a kind of contradiction in terms. The Lord over whom the heavens had opened, and to whom the heavenly name had been given, fulfilling all righteousness by submitting to the baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins, was a profound perplexity to the Baptist. Strange was it that he who would have power to deal with the Holy Ghost even as John had been using water should have been called in any real sense to confess the sins of his own nature or life. John believed that Jesus was the Source of a fiery purity and purifying power, and that according to his own showing he had rejected all proposals which might bring Israel to his feet by assuming the <span class="accented">role</span> of their conquering Messiah. He had even treated these suggestions as temptations of the devil. Not to save his physical life from starvation would he use his miraculous energies for his own personal ends. Not to bring the whole Sanhedrin, priesthood, and temple guard, nay, even the Roman governor and court, to his feet, will he utter a word or wave a signal which they could misunderstand. His purpose was to identify himself, Son of God though he be, with the world - to "suffer all, that he might succour all." Because John knew that Jesus was so great he was brought to apprehend the veritable fact and central reality of the Lord's person and work. He saw by a Divine inspiration what Jesus was, and what he was about to do. The simple supposition that Jesus had made John the Baptist his confidant, on his return from the wilderness of temptation and victory, and that we owe the story of the temptation to the facts of Christ's experience which had been communicated to John, do more than any other supposition does to expound the standpoint of John's remarkable exclamation. A library of discussion and exposition has been produced by the words which John uttered on this occasion, and different writers have taken opposite views, which in their origin proceed from the same root. The early Greek interpreters were moving in a true direction when they looked to the celebrated oracle of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> as the primary signification of the great phrase, "The Lamb of God." The image used to portray the suffering Sin-bearer is the "Lamb brought silently to the slaughter," "a Sheep dumb before his shearers." Doubtless the first implication of this comparison arose from the prophet's conception of the patience, gentleness, and submission of the sublime but suffering "Servant of God;" but the fourth, fifth, sixth, and twelfth verses of that chapter are so charged with the sin bearing of the great Victim, the vicarious and propitiatory virtue of his agony unto death, that we cannot separate the one from the other. He who is led as a Lamb to the slaughter bears our sins and suffers pain for us, is wounded on account of our transgressions: "The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all...  it pleased the Lord to bruise him," etc. The Servant of God is God's Lamb, appointed and consecrated for the highest work of sacrificial suffering and death. The LXX. has certainly used the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to bear, where John uses <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to take away. Meyer suggests that in the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> the previous notion of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is involved and presupposed. The Hebrew formula, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, are variously translated by the LXX., but generally in the sense of bearing the consequences of personal guilt or the sin of another (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-19.htm">Ezekiel 18:19</a>). In <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a> it is distinctly used of the priestly expiation for sin to be effected by Eleazar. Here and elsewhere <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, where God as the subject of the verb is described as lifting off sin from the transgressor and by bearing it himself - bearing it away. In several places the LXX. has gone further, translating the word, when God is the subject, by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, with the idea of forgiveness (<a href="../../par/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/85-3.htm">Psalm 85:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-17.htm">Genesis 50:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-24.htm">Isaiah 33:24</a>). Hence the Baptist, in using the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, had doubtless in his mind the large connotation of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> with the fundamental <span class="accented">prerequisite</span> of the taking away, which the oracle of Isaiah had suggested to him. John knew that the taking away of <span class="accented">sin</span> involved the twofold process: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the conference of a new spiritual life by the gift and grace of the Holy Spirit; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> such a removal of the consequences and shame and peril of sin as is involved by the bearing of <span class="accented">sins</span> in his own Divine personality. Thus he not only perceived from the accompaniments of the baptism that Jesus was the Son of God and the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, but that, being these, his meek submission and his triumphant repudiation of the temptations of the devil which were based upon the fact of his Divine sonship proved that he was the Divine sin-bearing Lamb of Isaiah's oracle. Many commentators have, however, seen a special reference to the Paschal lamb, with which Christ's work was, without hesitation, compared in later years (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). There can be no doubt that the Passover lamb was a "sin offering" (Hengstenberg, 'Christ of the Old Testament,' vol. 4:351;  Baur, 'Uber die Ursprung und Bedeutung des Passah-Fest,' quoted by Lucke, 1:404). It was God's sacrifice by pre-eminence, and the blood of the lamb was offered to God to make atonement, and it freed Israel from the curse that fell on the firstborn of Egypt. John, the son of a sacrificing priest, the Nazarite, the stern prophet of the wilderness, was familiar with all the ritual and the lessons of that solemn festival; and might look on the Son of God, selected for this sacrifice, as fulfilling in singular and unique fashion the function of the Passover Lamb for the whole world. But John would not be limited by the Paschal associations. Day by day lambs were presented before God as <span class="accented">burnt</span> offerings, as expressions of the desire of the offerers to accept absolutely the supreme will of God. Moreover, the lamb of the trespass offering was slain for atonement (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-35.htm">Leviticus 4:35</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-11.htm">Leviticus 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a>), either when physical defilement excluded the sufferer from temple worship, or when a Nazarite had lost the advantage of his vow by contact with the dead. Even the ceremonial of the great Day of Atonement, though other animal victims were used, suggested the same great thought of propitiatory suffering and death. These various forms of sacrificial worship must have been in the minds of <span class="accented">both Isaiah and John. They are the key to Isaiah's prophecy, and this in its turn is the basis of the cry of John.</span> The New Testament apostles and evangelists, whether accurate or not in their exegesis, did repeatedly take this oracle of Isaiah's as descriptive of the work of the Lord, and other early Christian writers treated the chapter as though it were a fragment of their contemporaneous evidence and exposition (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22-25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-28.htm">Acts 8:28</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16</a>; Clement, '1 Ep. ad Cor.,' 16.). John was standing further back, and on an Old Testament platform, but we have, in his knowledge of Isaiah's prophecies, and his familiarity with the sacrificial system of which that oracle foreshadowed the fulfilment, quite enough to account for the burning words in which he condensed the meaning of the ancient sacrifices, and saw them all transcended in the suffering Son of God. The author of 'Ecce Homo,' by identifying the "Lamb of God" with the imagery of <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, supposed that John saw, in the inward repose and spiritual joyfulness of Jesus, the power he would wield to take away the sin of the world. "He (John) was one of the dogs of the flock of Jehovah, Jesus was one of the Lambs of the good Shepherd." There is no hint whatever of these ideas in the psalm. This curiosity of exegesis has not secured any acceptance. Some difficulty has been felt in the fact that John should have made such progress in New Testament thought; but the experience through which John has passed during his contact with Jesus, the sentiment with which he found the Lord whom he sought coming to his baptism, the agony that he foresaw must follow the contact of such a One with the prejudices and sins of the people, above all, the mode in which our Lord was treating the current expectation of Messiah regarding its eagerly desired manifestations as temptations of the devil, flashed the whole of Isaiah's oracle into sudden splendour. He saw the Lamb already led to slaughter, and his blood upon the very door posts of every house; he saw him lifting, bearing, carrying away, the sin of the world, all impurity, transgression, and shame. His atoning sacrifice is already going on. The sins of mankind fall on the Holy One. He sees him pouring out his soul unto death, and making gentle intercession for his murderers; so in a glorious ecstasy he cries, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD!" (see my 'John the Baptist,' ch. 6. &sect; 2, pp. 369-386).

If the shorter reading of vers. 26, 27 be correct, then the occasion on which this great utterance was first made is not described. If it be not expunged from vers. 26, 27, we may imagine that John is now referring to what he said on the previous day to the Sanhedrim. If internal reasons may help to decide a reading, I should be inclined, with Godet as against Meyer, to say that this is the obvious reference. Here, too, the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> is added as explanation of what was enigmatical in ver. 26. The whole saying has already found place in the prologue. The threefold citation reveals the profound impression which the words of the Baptist had made upon his most susceptible disciple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a></div><div class="verse">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-34.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The <span class="accented">purpose of John's</span>  <span class="accented">own mission was to introduce to Israel the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I for my part knew him not.</span> This is thought by some to be incompatible with the statement of <a href="../../par/matthew/3-14.htm">Matthew 3:14</a>, where the Baptist displayed sufficient knowledge of Jesus to have exclaimed, "I have need to be baptized of thee." Early commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ammonius, quoted in 'Catena Patrum,' suggested that John's long residence in the wilderness had prevented his knowing his kinsman; Chrysostom, 'Hom. 16. in Joannem,' urged that he was not familiar with his person; Epiphanius, 'Adv. Haer.,' 30, and Justin Martyr, 'Dial.,' 100, 88, refer to a long passage in the 'Gospel of the Ebionites,' which, notwithstanding numerous perversions, yet suggests a method of conciliation of the two narratives, that the sign of the opening heavens and the voice occasioned the consternation of John, and explains his deprecation of the act which he had already performed (see my 'John the Baptist,' pp. 313, 314; Nicholson, 'Gospel according to the Hebrews,' pp. 38-40). Neander has suggested the true explanation: "In contradistinction to that which John now saw in the Divine light, all his previous knowledge appeared to be a non-knowledge." John knew <span class="accented">of Jesus</span>, as his kinsman; he knew him as One mightier than himself - One whose coming, as compared with his own, was as the coming of the Lord. When Jesus approached him for baptism, John therefore knew quite enough to make him hesitate to baptize the Christ. He knew more than enough to induce him to say, "I have need to be baptized of thee." Godet imagines that, since baptism was preceded by confession, John found that the confession made by Jesus was of such a lofty, saintly, God-like type of repudiation of sin, as that John himself had never attained to. This representation fails from attributing to John the function of a sacerdotal confessor of later days, and is out of harmony altogether with the meaning and potency of our Lord's confession of the sin of the whole of that human nature which he had taken upon himself. The knowledge which John had of Jesus was as nothing to the blaze of light which burst upon him when he realized the idea that Jesus was the Son of God. The "I knew him not" of this verse was a subsequent reflection of the Baptist when the sublime humility, the dovelike sweetness, and the spiritual might of Jesus were revealed to him. A blind man who had received his sight during the hours of darkness might imagine, when he saw the reflected glory of the moon or morning star in the eye of dawn, that he knew the nature and had felt the glory of light; but amidst the splendours of sunrise or of noon he might justly say, "I knew it not" (compare the language of Paul, <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, and of this same evangelist, <a href="../../par/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>. See Archdeacon Farrar's 'Life of Christ,' vol. 1:117; my 'John the Baptist,' p. 315). <span class="cmt_word">But that he should be manifested to Israel, for this cause I came baptizing in</span> (with) <span class="cmt_word">water</span>. It was traditionally expected that Elijah should anoint Messiah. John perceives now the transitional nature of his own mission. His baptism retires into the background. He sees that its whole meaning was the introduction of Messiah, the manifestation of the Son of God to Israel. It may be said that the ministry of the wilderness, with the vast impression it produced, is represented by the synoptists as of more essential importance in itself. John's own judgment, however, here recorded, is the true key to the whole representation. The synoptic narrative shows very clearly that, as a matter of fact, the Johannine ministry culminated at the baptism of Jesus, and lost itself in the dawn of the great day which it inaugurated and heralded. The Fourth Gospel does but give the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of such an arrangement, and refer the origin of the idea to John himself. If John did not <span class="accented">intensify</span> the sense of sin which Messiah was to soothe and take away; if John did not, by baptism with water, excite a desire for an infinitely nobler and more precious baptism; if John did not prepare a way for One of vastly more moment to mankind and to the kingdom of God than himself, - his whole work was a failure. In that John saw his own relation to the Christ - he saw his own place in the dispensations of Providence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a></div><div class="verse">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And John bore testimony, saying, I have seen</span> (perfect) <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it</span> (<span class="cmt_word">he</span>) <span class="cmt_word">abode upon him.

There can be no reasonable doubt that the evangelist makes reference to the synoptic tradition of the baptism of Jesus by John, although it may suit some uncompromising opponents of the Fourth Gospel to say that the baptism is here omitted. The act of the rite is not <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> described; but the chief accompaniment and real meaning of the baptism is specially portrayed. All the well known cycles of criticism make their special assault on the narratives at this point. Rationalism finds in a thunderstorm and the casual flight of a pigeon what John magnified into a supernatural portent; Straussianism sees the  growth of a legend from prepared sources of Hebrew tradition, and endeavours to aggravate into irreconcilable discrepancy the various accounts; Baur and Hilgenfeld accentuate the objectively supernatural portent, so as the more easily to put it into the region of ignorant superstition; others find the hint or sign of Gnostic handling; and Keim suggests that it is the poetic colouring which a later age unconsciously attributed to the Baptist and the Christ. Let it be noticed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the present Gospel does not augment, but diminishes, the miraculous element as compared with the synoptic narrative. The 'Gospel of the Hebrews ' added further embellishments still. Our Gospel compels us to believe that the <span class="accented">mind of the Baptist</span> was the chief region of the miracle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The author of this Gospel might, if he had chosen, have selected his own experience on the Mount of Transfiguration in vindication of a Divine attestation of the Sonship; but he preferred to fall back upon the testimony of his revered master. Peter, James, and <span class="accented">John</span> were <span class="accented">unprepared</span> for what they saw and heard on that occasion; and Peter knew not what he said, so great was the awful wonder that fell upon him then. Here, however, is recorded a vision for which the mind of the great forerunner <span class="accented">was</span> prepared. He expected to see the Spirit of God in some manner blend his energy with that of the individual who would prove to be the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> John does not discriminate the methods of the two communications, and from this narrative all that could be inferred positively is that the mind of John, by objective or subjective process, of which we know nothing, received the communication and the sacred impression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The synoptic narrative, <span class="accented">prima facie</span>, differs from this representation. At all events <a href="../../par/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21, 22</a> speaks of "opened heavens," "the Holy Spirit in bodily form as a dove," and a voice addressed to the Lord, "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased." This account is taken by Strauss as the key to the other three, and he urges that they must all be interpreted in harmony with it. But from the time of Origen, the exegesis of <span class="accented">Matthew's</span> account no less emphatically states (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> if with De Wette, Bleck, Baur, and Keim, we take <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as the subject of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) that John <span class="accented">saw</span> the Holy Spirit descending like a dove and coming upon (Christ) him, and that the voice was addressed to John, "This is my beloved Son," etc. In Mark's account the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> are susceptible of the same interpretation. It should be observed that Luke's narrative clearly implies that our Lord's baptism took place at some unspecified opportunity, and simply gives the summing up of the impression produced upon the mind of John. It is more reasonable to interpret Luke in harmony with the main conception of Matthew and John than to press the latter into forced harmony with the former. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The great difficulty is the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. But surely the prophetic mind was accustomed to dwell in the midst of similar visual shapes of spiritual things. There was <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> enough in the cherubim, olive trees, horses, armies, vials, and cities of the Apocalypse, and there were "voices" heard by Ezekiel, Hosea, Elijah, and by John himself which could be, were, and even must be, described in terms of physical facts, which no interpreters have ever felt compelled to transfer into the region of phenomena. There are still intensely vivid intuitions of spiritual fact which transcend all sensible or logical proof. If John saw and heard these things so far as his own consciousness was concerned, there is enough to account for every peculiarity of the narrative. He saw the Shechinah glory hovering over the Lord Jesus, officially consecrating a human personality. The dove<span class="accented">like</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>) form and motion taken by the heavenly light reminded him of the brooding of the Spirit of God upon the primaeval waters. He looked into the face of the Holy One of God - majesty and meekness, Divine glory, human gentleness, a sanctity as of the holy place, a freedom as of the birds of heaven, force like that of the steeds of the rising sun, inward peace like the calm of a brooding dove, transfigured the Lord. This dovelike splendour abode upon him, <span class="accented">passed into him</span>; and the voice (the invincible conviction, the resistless consciousness that often can find no other expression than "Thus saith the Lord") was heard, "This is my beloved Son," etc. We cannot say what John saw; we know what he said; and it covered the consciousness of the most stupendous reality yet enacted on the earth. That which John had been taught to predict as approaching was now seen to have actually come about, he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost has commenced his wondrous mission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The whole question as to the relation of the Holy Spirit and the Logos - the relation between the statement of ver. 13 and vers. 31-33 - demands special consideration. A few words here may suffice. Baur, Eichhorn, and others have urged that either the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are identical, and that that which John means (vers. 1-14) by the <span class="accented">Logos</span> he afterwards resolves into the <span class="accented">pneuma</span>, or that this scene and these words are incompatible with the prologue. It is true that Philo and Justin ('Apol.,' 1:33) do use the two terms as practically identical. But John has recorded our Lord's own words as to the antithesis of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> (ch. 3.), declaring in his prologue that the Logos is the Source of all the life  and light of men, and that the Logos came into the world and became flesh. Now, if John did not abide firmly in this thought, he would have represented incarnate God as undergoing the process of regeneration at his baptism, than which nothing would be more abhorrent to his entire theory of the Christ. The relations of the Logos and the Pneuma to each other and to the Father, metaphysically considered, are profoundly intricate, but the relations of Father, Word, and Holy Spirit to the Person of the Lord Jesus have been several times asserted by the apostles, and cannot be interchanged (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 5; Lucke, 'Comm. uber d. Evang. Joh.,' vol. 1. pp. 433-443)

The Old Testament standpoint which John occupied enabled him from the first to identify the Messiah with the "Son of God;" but surely this is the record of the first occasion when the Baptist recognized the token that One who sustained such relation with the Father stood before him. There is much in this Gospel and the synoptic narrative to show that the disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16, 17</a>) identified the Christ with the Son of God. The tempter and the demoniacs are familiar with the idea (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>). The high priest at the trial and the Roman centurion (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>), Nathanael (<a href="../../par/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), Martha (<a href="../../par/john/11-27.htm">John 11:27</a>), hail him as Son of God. Though the Lord for the most part preferred to speak of himself as "Son of man," yet in this Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>) he frequently claims this lofty designation. Nor is it confined to this Gospel, for in <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-27</a>, we have practically the same confession. Now, the declaration of this verse is in intimate connection with what precedes. Neither the Baptist nor the evangelist implies that, by Christ's baptism, and by that which John saw of the descent and abiding of the Spirit upon the Lord, he was there and then constituted "the Son of God." From this misapprehension of the Gospel arose the Gnostic-Ebionite view of the heavenly <span class="accented">Soter</span> descending on Christ, to depart from him at the Crucifixion. The main significance of the entire paragraph is the special revelation given to John, his consequent illumination and momentous testimony, one that sank into the soul of his most susceptible disciples, and thus made this declaration the "<span class="accented">true birth hour of Christendom"</span> (Ewald, Meyer). The narrative does not imply that Christ's own consciousness of Divine sonship then commenced. He knew who he was when he spoke, at twelve years of age, of "the business of my Father;" but it would be equally inadequate exegesis to suppose that no communication was then made to the sacred humanity which had been fashioned by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin, and by which he became from the first "the Son of God." The Lord's humanity did become alive to the solemn and awful responsibilities of this public recognition. He knew that the hour was come for his Messianic activity, and the distinct admission of this was the basis of each of the diabolic temptations from which he immediately suffered. There was a unique glory in this sonship which differed from all other usage of the same phrase. Many an Oriental mystic and Egyptian pharaoh and even Roman emperor had thus described themselves; but the Baptist did not speak of himself in this or any other sense as "Son of God." There was flashed into his mind the light of a Divine relationship between Jesus and the Father which convinced him of the preexisting life of him who was chronologically coming after him. It was probably this momentous utterance which led to the deputation of the Sanhedrin, and induced them to ask for the explanation of a mystery transcending all that John had said from the day of his showing unto Israel" (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 6. &sect; 1). Many commentators here encounter the unquestionable difficulty of John the Baptist's message from the prison. I prefer to discuss it at the close of ch. 3. (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 7: "The Ministry of the Prison"). Here it is sufficient to observe that the vivid intuition and revelation which John obtained touching the deep things of God in Christ, and the vast and far-reaching testimonies which he bore to the Son of God, to the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, the pre-existent glory of him that came after him, and to "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," were, nevertheless, in <span class="accented">the evangelist's mind historically coincident</span> with the fact that John never did unite himself to the circle of Christ's immediate followers. The "John" of the Fourth Gospel remained in an independent position - friendly, rejoicing in the Bridegroom's voice, but not one of his followers. The preparatory work with which he began his ministry he continued and pursued to the tragic end.

The imperfect tense of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> suggests the idea that he was waiting for some fresh announcement, some  providential event, to determine his course. The "again" refers back to ver. 29. Much must be read between the lines as to these disciples, their excited interest in the words already uttered by their master.

This implies that their relative functions were not identical, and not to be confounded. This is the last time when the Baptist and the Christ were together, and the sublime meekness of John, and his surrender of all primary claims to deference, throw light on the unspeakable and gentle dignity of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">He saith, Behold the Lamb of God.</span> The simple phrase, without further exposition, implies that he was recalling to their minds the mighty appellation which he had bestowed upon the Saviour on the previous day, with all the additional interpretation of the term with which it had then been accompanied. The brevity of the cry here marks the emphasis which it bore, and the rich associations it already conveyed. The testimony to the method by which John had, at least in part, arrived at the conclusion is very remarkable. Jesus would not have fulfilled in John's mind the prophetic oracle of the Divine Lamb, or the sacrificial offering for the sin of the world, if steps had not been taken to convince John that he was the veritable Son of God. No mere human nature, but only that humanity which was an incarnation of the Eternal Logos, and filled with the abiding of the Holy Spirit, could be God's Lamb. Cf. here the remarkable fact that it was when the disciples had learned more clearly and grasped more firmly the idea of his Divine sonship that the Lord repeatedly proceeded to explain to them the approach of his sacrificial sufferings and death. As Son of God, he must die for man (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 43, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-29.htm">John 16:29-32</a>).

This event, if not profoundly symbolic (as Godet says), is typical of the whole process which has gone on in augmenting rapidity from that day to this. If Jesus were what John said, if they were able on his showing to grasp this much concerning the Lord, they would find in him what John could never be to them. John might awaken the sense of sin, peril, shame, and fear; he had no power to allay it. The lonely Christ has as yet not called one disciple into his fellowship, but as Lamb of God he has power to draw all men to himself. The word now spoken was enough. It divided the bond which up to this time had united the disciples to John, and made them conspicuous forever in the group which "follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." "Primae origines ecclcsiae Christianae" (Bengel).

He assumes their desire for that which he alone can supply. They, on seeing their Christ, the Son of God, all humanly before them, do not fall at his feet, but approach him as a human teacher, and give him the ordinary honorific title of a wise, competent instructor. <span class="cmt_word">They said unto him, Rabbi</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is, being interpreted, Teacher</span>). The parenthetic clause reveals the fact that the Gospel was written for Gentile readers. The title "Rabbi" was a modern one, only dating from the days of Hillel, about  <span class="date">B.C. 30</span>, and therefore needing interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Where abidest thou?</span> Renan founds on this phrase "Rabbi" the supposition that, when John and Jesus meet, they are <span class="accented">both</span> surrounded by groups of followers. The narrative is written to convey a precisely opposite conception. Christ did not refuse this "courtesy title" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>), and we can gather nothing else from the narrative. The question itself reveals the mind of the evangelist. In the opinion of all writers (favourable and hostile), the writer, according to a deliberate method adopted by him, wished to imply that he was one of the two disciples who first left the Baptist to attach themselves to Jesus. The very form of the question adds to the probability. It is a characteristic longing of the disciple, whom Jesus loved so well, to be near and with his Master. He craved no laconic phrase, no solitary word, but some more prolonged fellowship, some undisturbed communion and instruction. The varied emotions of that day, moreover, were conspicuously reproduced in the solemn title which the son of Zebedee most persistently applied to his glorified Lord in the Apocalypse. More than thirty times he refers to him as "the Lamb."

On that hypothesis the "tenth hour" would be ten a.m., and the two disciples would have remained with our Lord throughout the day. This is not necessarily involved by our present context, and we are not sure that a like supposition will free us from all difficulty in <a href="../../par/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>. Meyer says that "the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> reckoning is involved necessarily in <a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>; and in <a href="../../par/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6, 52</a> it is not excluded." The ordinary New Testament measurement would make the hour four p.m., and on that understanding several hours might still be open for the sacred fellowship. The personal witness shows himself by this delicate hint of exact time, this special note of remembrance concerning the most critical epoch of his life.

The other disciple, with the studied reticence ever preserved about his own designation, is left unnamed by the writer. "Simon Peter" is here spoken of as the better-known man. The bestowment of this designation on Andrew shows that the Gospel was written when Peter's greater name was widely recognized, and the reference is made without the faintest touch of depreciation. Simon Peter's reputation gives force and importance to the record of Andrew's faith. The evangelist's intimate friend Andrew is thus lifted out of his comparative obscurity among the apostolate, not by his association with John, but by his relationship with Simon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a></div><div class="verse">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">The Messiah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He</span> (Andrew) <span class="cmt_word">first</span> <span class="cmt_word">findeth his own brother Simon.</span> Dr. Plummer here observes, "In Church history St. Peter is everything, and St. Andrew nothing: but would there have been an Apostle Peter but for Andrew?" Hengstenberg, De Wette, and others have explained the curious word "first," as though both the unnamed disciple and Andrew had gone together to search out Simon, and that Andrew had been the first of the two to be successful. This would leave the <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> less satisfactorily accounted for than the simple supposition that each of the disciples started in different directions to find "his own" brother, and that Andrew was more fortunate than his companion. The two pairs of brothers are frequently mentioned as being together. James and John, Andrew and Simon, are partners on the lake of Galilee in their fishing business, and are finally called into full discipleship and apostolate after the visit to Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19, 11</a>). The four are specially mentioned as being together (<a href="../../par/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>), so that it is not unreasonable to suggest that when Andrew first sought "his own" brother Simon, John also sought for "his own" brother James. It is worthy of note that the evangelist never mentions his own name, nor that of James, nor that of their mother Salome, although he does imply their presence. Andrew <span class="cmt_word">saith to him</span> (Simon), <span class="cmt_word">We have found the Messias</span> - the article is omitted, as <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is merely the translation of" Messiah" - (<span class="cmt_word">which</span>, adds the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">is, being interpreted, Christ</span>). Andrew is described on two additional occasions as bringing others to Jesus (<a href="../../par/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a>). Here the rapidity and depth of his convictions are noted. The writer's own impression is implied rather than given. He hides his own faith under the bolder and more explicit utterance of his friend. This was the result upon the mind of two disciples of the first conference with Jesus. Marvellous enough that such a thought should have possessed them, however imperfect their ideas were as yet concerning the Christ! The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> implies that they had long been waiting for the Consolation of Israel, looking for his coming, seeking his appearing. "We have sought," they say, "and we have found." A more wonderful <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> than that of  Archimedes. The plural does not necessitate the presence of John, though it does suggest the agreement of Andrew and his friend in the same august conclusion. What sense of Divine things must have come from the words and looks of Jesus! He who produced such impression on the Baptist as that which the four evangelists report, had done even more with the susceptible spirits of his two disciples. The Baptist never actually called Jesus "the Christ." But when he had testified to the pre-existing glory, the heavenly origin, the sublime functions of the great <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and by special revelation on his forewarned spirit had declared that he was the Son of God, the Lamb of God, and the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and fire: what must not the inference be when his two disciples came into yet closer and more intimate relations with Jesus? The Jewish idea of "Messiah" (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, only occurring here and <a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>), equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, Aramaized form, the <span class="accented">stat. emphat</span>, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>); cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (Kautzsch, 'Gram. des Bib. Aram.,' p. 10), was the term used among all classes to denote One who should, as anointed by God, fulfil the functions of Prophet, Priest and King, who should realize the splendid visions of the ancient prophecies, and combine in himself a wonderful exhibition of Divine majesty and even of awful suffering. We see that the Baptist understood what was meant by the title, but denied its applicability to himself. The Samaritans believe in a coming Prophet and Saviour (<a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25, 29</a>). The people believe that Messiah will work miracles, that he will be born in Bethlehem, that he will abide forever, that he would prove to be the Son of God. The King Messiah is a pre-existing power and presence in their past history. He will come in the clouds, and reign forever and ever (see <a href="../../par/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26, 31</a> and John 7:42; John 12:34). According to W&uuml;nsche ('Neue Beitrage zurerlauterung der Ev., aus Talmud und Midrasch,' pp. 499, 500), the Talmud ('Pesachim,' 54, and 'Nedavim,' 39) declares that Messias, or his Name, was one of the seven things created before the world; and Midrasch ('Schemoth,' par. 19) on <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> declares that the King Messias was the Firstborn of God. The more spiritual ideas of John the Baptist have prepared the two disciples to see, even in the travel-stained, lowly Man, "the Messiah." Of course, their idea of Messiah and their idea of Jesus would suffer wonderful development, and be harmonized and blended into a sublime unity by later instructions; but they had made this great discovery, and hastened to impart it.

The assumption of the Tubingen critics, that a desire to lower Peter from his primacy is conspicuous in this passage, cannot be sustained. Though Andrew and John precede Peter in their earliest relations with Jesus, yet Peter is undoubtedly the most conspicuous character, to whom the Lord from the first gives an honourable cognomen (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/6-67.htm">John 6:67-69</a> and John 21:15, etc.). (Compare here, for historic changes of name, <a href="../../par/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>.) Weiss ('Life of Christ,' Eng. trans., 1:370) says admirably, "There is no ground for assuming that this is an anticipation of <a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. Simon was not to bear this name until he was deserving of it. Jesus never called him anything but Simon (<a href="../../par/mark/14-37.htm">Mark 14:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). Paul calls him by the names Peter and Cephas.... The evangelist is right when he beholds in this scene a more than human acumen.  ... The history shows he was not deceived in Peter." This narrative cannot be a Johannine setting forth of the first call of the four disciples as given in the synoptists. If it be, it is a fictitious modification. Place, occasion, and immediate result are all profoundly different. The one narrative cannot be twisted into the other. Are the anti-harmonists correct in saying that they are irreconcilable? Certainly not. There is no indication that before John was cast into prison, before Jesus commenced his public ministry in Galilee, he had called disciples away from their ordinary duties to be his apostles. Some of these four may have returned, as Jesus himself did, to his family and domestic surroundings (<a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>). John may have accompanied Jesus to Jerusalem and through Samaria. But there is much to make it probable that Simon, Andrew, and at least, were, during the whole of that period, on the lake pondering the future. Christ's solemn, sudden call to them to become "fishers of men," after a manifestation to them of his supernatural powers, presupposes rather than excludes this earlier interview. Simon, on that occasion, by the exclamation recorded (<a href="../../par/luke/5-5.htm">Luke 5:5</a>), reveals an earlier acquaintance with and reverence for his <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (see an admirable vindication of this position in Weiss, 'Life of Jesus,' vol. 1.). The Lord, in this first interview, penetrates and denominates the character of the most illustrious of his followers. His rocklike fortitude, which, though sorely assailed and chafed by the storms of the great sea of opinion and prejudice, formed the central nucleus of that Church against which the gates of hell have not prevailed. Our Lord implied the strength of his nature, even when he predicted his great fall (<a href="../../par/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a></div><div class="verse">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43, 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the fourth day after the deputation from the Sanhedrin - <span class="cmt_word">he willed</span> - or was minded - <span class="cmt_word">to go forth into Galilee</span>, to commence his homeward journey. Whether this implies an actual beginning of his route, or suggests, before any step was taken in that direction, that the following incidents occurred, cannot be determined, though commentators take opposite sides, as though something important depended upon it. The former supposition is, however, in keeping with the considerable distance, on any hypothesis of the site of Bethany, between it and Cana. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> (the Lord himself "finds;" the two earliest disciples had sought and found him) <span class="cmt_word">findeth Philip</span>; very probably on the route from the scene of John's baptism to the Bethsaida on the western shore of the Lake of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus saith to him, Follow me;</span> become one of my <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The arguments, the reasons, which weighed with him are not given at first, but we find that he soon learned the same great lesson as that which the other disciples had acquired, and he clothes them in memorable words. <span class="cmt_word">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> This is a remark of the evangelist, who did not consider it necessary to say from what city or neighbourhood he had himself issued. This town has utterly perished (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20</a>), although some travellers (Robinson, 3:359; Wilson and Warren) believe that indications were found north of <span class="accented">Khan Minyeh</span>, and others have identified it with <span class="accented">Tell-Hum.</span> Some writers ('Picturesque Palestine,' vol. 2:74, 81, etc.) discover it in <span class="accented">Ain et</span> <span class="accented">Tabighah</span>, where some remains of a fountain reservoir and other buildings are found. It was identified by Thomson with <span class="accented">Abu-Zany</span>, on the west of the entrance of Jordan into the lake. The two pairs of brothers must have been familiar with Philip. Some interesting hints of character are attainable from <a href="../../par/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>, in which an incident occurs where Philip revealed a practical wisdom and confident purpose, and again in <a href="../../par/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21, 22</a>, where Andrew and Philip are made the confidants of the Greeks, and Philip is the one who seems able and willing to introduce them to Jesus. In <a href="../../par/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8</a> Philip uttered one of the great longings of the human heart - a passionate desire to solve all mysteries, by the vision of the Father; but he lets out the fact that be had not seen all that he might have seen and known in Jesus himself. Subsequent history shows that Philip was one of the "great lights of Asia," and was held in the highest esteem (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 3:31). He must not be confounded with Philip the evangelist, whose daughters prophesied (<a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a></div><div class="verse">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="accented">Further convictions of the disciples.</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>) <span class="accented">The theme of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Philip findeth Nathanael.</span> He has no sooner accepted the Lord who found him, than he is eager to communicate the Divine secret to others. It seems widely accepted, though without any positive proof, that this Nathanael was identical with the Bartholomew (Bar Tolmai, son of Ptolemy) of the four lists of apostles, on the following grounds: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In <a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a> Nathanael once more appears among the innermost circle of the apostles, and is moreover mentioned there in company with Thomas. In the synoptic Gospels Bartholomew is associated also with Philip, although in Acts, Luke ranks him with Matthew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is probable that Nathanael was one of the twelve, and, this being so, it is more probable that he should have been identical with Bartholomew than with any other, he is distinguished from Thomas and the two sons of Zebedee in <a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, and the whole circumstance of his call  suggests no resemblance to that of Matthew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His well known name is only that of a patronymic, and suggests the existence of another and a personal name. This identification cannot be proved, but there is no other that is more probable. Nathanael (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>), as a name in Hebrew, is identical with Theodorus, "God is giver" (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-8.htm">Numbers 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-14.htm">1 Chronicles 2:14</a>; see also 1 Esdras 1:9 1 Esdras 9:22). Thoma ('Die Genesis des Johannes-Evangeliums,' p. 409, etc.) endeavours to identify Nathanael with Matthew, and to institute a series of ingenious comparisons between the synoptic "Matthew and Zacchaeus" and this Israelite without guile, and to compare the marriage feast at Nathanael's "Cana" with the feast in Matthew's, or Levi's, house. The subtle fancy and dramatic moral which he attributes to every clause of the narrative render the authorship a greater puzzle than ever. Philip <span class="cmt_word">saith unto him, We have found</span> - we, the group of friends already illumined with the sublime hope - <span class="cmt_word">him of whom Moses in the Law, and the prophets, wrote.</span> This reveals the characteristics of the conversation which had passed between the Lord and the favoured three. It corresponds with what occurred on the way to Emmaus. The Lord rested upon the germinant ideas, and prophetic hopes, suggestive types, and positive predictions of the Old Testament, and met, while he refined and elevated, the current expectations of his time. There was to be no break with the old covenant, except by fulfilling it, establishing its reality and its vast place in the revelation of the supreme will of God. The question naturally arises, "Well, but who is he? what is his name? whither has he come? whence does he hail?" The continuation of the sentence is obviously not in apposition with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, but the direct object of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">We have found Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of Joseph of Nazareth</span>. This is the simple utterance of a matter of fact - a current piece of intelligence now circulating in the group of the earliest disciples. The idea of his being Joseph's Son was widely diffused; the fact that the Lord spent the first thirty years of his human life in Nazareth, was a commonplace of the synoptic story. The argument of the Tubingen and Straussian criticism, that the fourth evangelist was ignorant of Christ's Birth from above, is contradicted by the prologue, with all the assertions of the Lord's pre-existence, and especially by ver. 14 with <a href="../../par/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>, and 13. That he was ignorant of the birth in Bethlehem, with the numberless proofs of his knowledge of Matthew's and Luke's Gospels, is absurd. The language put into Philip's lips does not exhaust the knowledge of the evangelist on this subject (cf. <a href="../../par/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a></div><div class="verse">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?

He might have known that Jonah, Hosea, Nahum, probably Elijah, Elisha, and Amos, were Galileans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That Nazareth was a secluded and contemptible village seems disproved by the interesting papers of Dr. Selah Merrill, on "Galilee in the Time of our Lord," <span class="accented">Amer. Bibl. Sacra.</span>, January and April, 1874. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That the character of its people should have been jealous, turbulent, capricious, and led to our Lord's subsequent preference for Capernaum, does not explain the force of the inquiry. The "good thing" may, however, be the contrast between the unimportance of the place in the political or religious history of the people, as compared with Jerusalem, Tiberias, Jericho, Bethlehem. It is never mentioned in the Old Testament or in Josephus. Nathanael may have known its mediocrity, and have been startled by the possibility of a carpenter's son, in a spot utterly undistinguished, being the Messiah of whom their sacred writers spoke. "Despised Nazareth" is a phrase rather due to the splendour of the flower that grew upon its barren soil, and became contrasted afterwards with the unlooked for glory and claims of the Nazarene. <span class="cmt_word">Philip saith unto him, Come and see</span>. This was his strongest argument. To look upon him is to believe. He had much more to learn in after days (<a href="../../par/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8, 9</a>). At this moment he and Nathanael stood on ground consecrated by ancient history, and thrilling with the thunder peals of the Baptist, mazed and wistful from much longing, thinking of the union between heaven and earth which had been revealed in the experience of ancient prophets, dwelling on the careers of Israel, Moses, and Elijah in their rapt transports, musing under fig trees or the like, and longing for the great King. He may naturally have reasoned on this wise: "Can it be true that the Christ, the King of Israel, the Lord of the temple, the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, is indistinguishable from the rest of mankind in this very crowd? Would that I too might see in him, as John has done, some vision of the opened heaven, that I too might hear some unmistakable  voice!" If these were the musings of Nathanael - and surely there is not a trace of unreason in such meditations in the breast of a disciple of the Baptist - the conversation which follows is more easy to understand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him</span> - for Nathanael at once obeyed the summons of Philip - <span class="cmt_word">and saith of him</span>; not, <span class="accented">to him</span> - saith in the hearing of the unnamed disciple, who could not leave his Master's side. There are numerous indications in ch. 1 and 2 of a qualification of Jesus which, in <a href="../../par/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>, is described as knowing what was in man. He read the thought and character of Simon and Philip, of Nathanael, and of his mother; and here he makes use of his Divine prerogative and, as on a multitude of other occasions, penetrated the surface to the inner motive and heart. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, an Israelite indeed;</span> one who fulfils the true idea of Israel, a prince with God, a conqueror of God by prayer, and conqueror of man by submission, penitence, and restitution; one who has renounced the spirit of supplanter and taken that of penitent. "Confident in self-despair," he has relinquished his own strength, and lays hold of the strength of God, and is at peace. <span class="cmt_word">In whom is no guile;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no self-deception, and no disposition to deceive others. The (<a href="../../par/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>) description of the blessedness of "the man whose transgressions are forgiven,...  and in whose spirit [LXX., 'mouth'] there is no guile (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," is the finest key to the significance of this passage. Christ does not say that this man is <span class="accented">sinless</span>, but guileless - free and full in his confession, knowing himself, and sheltering himself under no devices or seeming shows. The publican (it has been well said) was without guile when he cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" The Pharisee was steeped in self-deception and guile when he said, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men." Sincerity, openness of eye, simplicity of speech, no wish to appear other than what he is before God and man, affirms his guilelessness. Alas! the so called Israelite has widely departed from the fundamental idea of such a character, though not more so than Christians have become unlike the ideal disciples of Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a></div><div class="verse">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?</span> Without any title of respect, or admission as yet of any claims or right in him of whom Philip had spoken. There is, in this query, an abruptness of blunt sincerity which to some extent justifies the eulogium upon his innermost life. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee</span> - irrespective altogether of the excitement he has stirred within thee - <span class="cmt_word">when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee</span>. "The fig tree" was the type of the Israelite home (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>). There, not in the corners of the street, was he accustomed to meditate and pray. The <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> clause is in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, and (though another translation is grammatical) suggests that Christ saw him under conditions which had nothing whatever to do with those under which Philip called him. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is used for the most part of simple <span class="accented">sight</span>, and need not necessarily connote miraculous penetration and recognition of all that was passing in his mind. And yet the obvious intention of the evangelist is to convey more than casual observation. As Weiss says, "What is mentioned is not one isolated glance into the depths of the soul, but past events, along with their outward circumstances, are known to Jesus." "I saw thee" - I have not been ignorant of thee; I watched and thought of thee. The astonishing effect produced by this saying of the Lord has been variously conceived. Some have surmised preternatural optical powers exercised from a distance; others a simple observation without comment at the time when our Lord watched him in one of the places of retirement sacred to solemn meditations and instructions. It seems to me that the occasion to which our Lord referred must have been one of extreme spiritual interest and memorableness to Nathanael; some hour had passed of commanding influence upon his mind - one of those periods of visitation from the living God, when lives are recommenced, when an old world passes away and a new one has been made, of which the lips have never spoken, and which are among the deepest secrets of the soul. It was the conviction that his secret meditation had been surprised, that the unknown Stranger had fathomed the depth of his consciousness, which wrought and wrung the great confession of which we have here a crisp outline. <span class="accented">I saw thee</span>; and by this implication I can sympathize in all thy longings, [It is interesting to remember that Rabbi Akiba is described as studying the Law under a fig tree; and Augustine heard the voice which ruled his subsequent life "under a fig tree" ('Conf.,' 8:12, 28); and Buddha's most wonderful convictions and resolves occurred under the bo tree.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a></div><div class="verse">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nathanael</span> was overcome by irresistible conviction that here was the Searcher of hearts, One gifted with strange powers of sympathy, and with right to claim obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Answered</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span>  - now for the  first time with the title of <span class="accented">Rabbi</span>, or teacher - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art the Son of God.</span> Nothing is more obvious than that this is the reflection of the testimony of the Baptist. "The Son of God," not "<span class="accented">a</span> Son of God," or "a Man of God," but the Personage whose rank and glory my master John had recognized. He may have doubted before whether the Baptist had not gone wild with hallucination, and could have meant what he said. Now the reality has flashed upon his mind from the glance of the Saviour's eye and the tones of his voice (see notes on ver. 34). The great term could not have meant to him what it does now to the Church. Still the truth involved in his words is of priceless significance. Luthardt says, "Nathanael's faith will never possess <span class="accented">more</span> than it embraces at this moment." Godet adds, "The gold seeker puts his hand on an ingot; when he has coined it, he has it better, but not more." The idea of the Divine sonship comes from the Old Testament prophecy, has its root in <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and 72, and in all the strange wonderful literature which recognized in the ideal King upon Zion and upon David's throne One who forevermore has stood and will stand in personal relations with the Father. The Divine sonship is the basis on which Nathanael rears his further faith that he is <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">King of Israel.</span> He is Messiah-King, because he is "Son of God." The true Israelite recognizes his King (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>). We are not bound to believe that Nathanael saw all that Peter subsequently confessed to be the unanimous conviction of the twelve (<a href="../../par/john/6-69.htm">John 6:69</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>); but the various symphonies of this great confession encompass the Lord from his cradle to the cross. The synoptic narrative is as expressive and convincing as the Johannine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-50.htm">John 1:50</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50, 51.</span> - (<span class="accented">d</span>) <span class="accented">The Son of man, the link between heaven and earth.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said unto thee, that I saw thee underneath the fig tree, thou believest.</span> There is no need to transform this into a question, as though Jesus smiled a gentle reproof upon the rapidity with which Nathanael espoused his cause (cf. <a href="../../par/john/16-31.htm">John 16:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>). The Lord, on the contrary, congratulates him upon the sincerity with which he had at once admitted claims which had never been more explicitly expressed. Thou hast believed because I have made thee feel that I have sounded the depths of thy heart, by means which pass understanding. There are profounder abysses than the human heart. There are powers at my disposal calculated to create a more tender and inspiring faith, one which shall carry thee into other worlds as well as through this. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt see greater things than these</span>. There shall be vouchsafed a fuller, clearer revelation of what I am, which shall pour new and deeper meaning into the confession thou hast made. Hitherto the Lord was speaking to the one man; but now he says what would be applicable, not only to Nathanael, but to all who had found him, and accepted that outline of his functions and claims which had formed the substance of the latest teaching of John the Baptist. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a></div><div class="verse">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you.</span> The reduplicated <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> occurs twenty-five times in John's Gospel, and is in this form peculiar to the Gospel, although in its single form it occurs fifty times in the three synoptists.

The repetition of the word in an adverbial sense is found in <a href="../../par/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>. In <a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a> "Amen" is the name given to the Faithful Witness. The repetition of the word involves a powerful asseveration, made to overcome a rising doubt and meet a possible objection. The "I say unto you" takes, on the lips of Jesus, the place which "Thus saith the Lord" occupied on those of the ancient prophets. He speaks in the fulness of conscious authority, with the certain knowledge that he is therein making Divine revelation. He knows that he saith true; his word is truth. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you,</span> [<span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">henceforth</span>] <span class="cmt_word">ye shall see the heaven that has been opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> Notwithstanding the formidable superficial difficulty in the common reading, which declares that from the moment when the Lord spake, Nathanael should see what there is no other record that he ever literally saw; yet a deeper pondering of the passage shows the sublime spiritual sense in which those disciples who fully realized that they had been brought into blessed relationship with the "Son of man," saw also - that heaven, the abode of blessedness and righteousness, the throne of God, had been opened behind him and around him. The dream of Jacob is  manifestly referred to - the union between heaven and earth, between God and man, which dawned like a vision of a better time upon the old patriarchal life. That which was the dream of a troubled night may now be the constant experience of the disciples of the Lord. The ascension of the angelic ministers is here said to precede their descent. This is due to the original form of the dream of Jacob, but must be supplemented by the Lord's own statement (<a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), "No one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven." The free access to the heart of the Father, and to the centre of all authority in heaven and earth, is due only to those who have come already thence, who belong to him, "who go and return as the appearance of a flash of lightning." They ascend with the desires of the Son of man; they descend with all the faculty needed for the fulfilment of those desires. He, "the Son of man," is now on earth to commence his ministry of reconciliation, and is thus now equipped with all the powers needed for its realization. The same truth is taught by our Lord, when he said (cf. notes on John 3:13) that "the Son of man is in heaven," even when he walked the earth. The angelic ministry attendant upon our Lord is so inconspicuous that it does not fulfil the notable description of this verse, nor fill out its suggestions. The miraculous energies, the Divine revelations, the consummate heavenliness of his life, the power which his personality supplied to see and believe in heaven - in heaven opened, heaven near, heaven accessible, heaven propitious, heaven lavish of love - answers to the meaning of the mighty words. Thoma ('Die Genesis des Johannes-Evan.') sees the Johannine interpretation of the angels who ministered to Jesus after the conclusion of his temptation. But why does he call himself "the Son of man," in sharp response to, or in comment, on, the ascription by John the Baptist and Nathanael of the greater title "Son of God" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>)? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The phrase is one that our Lord currently used for himself, as especially descriptive of his position. It has been said that its origin must be looked for in the prophecies of Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>), where angelic powers are seen in loving lowly attendance on "one like to the Son of man," one whose human-hearted force contrasts with the "beast forces," the uncouth, sphynx-like blending of animal faculties which characterizes all the kingdoms and dynasties which the empire of the one like the Son of man would supersede. The term, "Son of man," is used repeatedly by Ezekiel for humanity set over against the Divine voice and power. There it corresponds with the Aramaic "Bar-Enosh," Son of man - a simple paraphrasis for "man" in his weakness, and often in his depression and sin. The 'Book of Henoch,' in numerous places, identifies "Son of man" with the Messiah (ch. 46. and 48.), but it cannot be clearly proved that the term was <span class="accented">popularly</span> current for the Messiah. Christ seems, in one place, to discriminate the two terms in popular expectation (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13, 16</a>); and in <a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a> he discriminates his earthly ministry as that of Son of man, from the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, though the dispensation of his human life, and of his eternal Spirit, constitute that of the one Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Another very remarkable fact is that, though Jesus calls himself "the Son of man" no fewer than seventy times, the apostles never attribute the favourite expression to him. The only instances of its use by other than the Lord himself, is by the dying Stephen, who thus describes his power and exalted majesty (<a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>), and John in the Apocalypse, who says the vision of the Lord was of one like unto the Son of man - a phrase clearly built upon the passage in <a href="../../par/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Saviour did not throughout the Gospel of John proclaim himself openly to the people as the Christ, avoiding a term which was so miserably degraded from his own conception of it; but he used a multitude of expressions to denote the spiritual force and significance of the Messianic dignity. Thus he described himself" as he that came down from heaven;" as the "Bread of heaven;" as the "Light of the world;" as "the good Shepherd; .... I am <span class="accented">he</span>;" "that which I said from the beginning," etc.; and therefore, when he adopted the phrase, "the Son of man," he attributed to it very special powers and dignities. The word seems to involve the Man, the perfect Man, the ideal Man, the second Adam, the supreme Flower engrafted on the barren stock of humanity, the Representative of the whole of humankind. Chronologically, this must have been the primary revelation. Through humanity that was archetypal and perfect, answering God's idea of man, the thought of the race has risen to a conception of Divine sonship. But metaphysically, logically, he could only fulfil the functions of Son of man, of <span class="accented">the Man</span>, because he was essentially the Son of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The dominant thought of the term has fluctuated between that which connotes his earthly ministry and humiliation, and lays stress on the privations and sufferings of the Son of man, and that which recites his highest claim to reverence and homage. Seeing that he claims to be the link between heaven and earth, Judge of quick and dead, the Head of the kingdom of God, who will come in his glory, with his holy angels, to divide sheep from goats, etc., as <span class="accented">Son of man</span>; and  seeing that, as Son of man, he gave himself for a ransom, and was as one that serveth, and presented his flesh and blood as the spiritual food of all that live; - the synthetic thought that issues from the twofold survey is that his highest glory is based upon his entire and utter sympathy with man. His humanity is that which gives him all his hold upon our heart; his sacrifice is his title to universal sovereignty. "He humbled himself to the death of the cross, wherefore God also has highly exalted him, giving even to him [humanity included] THE NAME that is above every name." Archdeacon Watkins, <span class="accented">in loco</span>, has called attention to the fact that it is not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "man as man, not Jew as holier than Greek, not freeman as nobler than bondman, not man as distinct from woman, but humanity.... The ladder from earth to heaven is in the truth, 'The Word was made flesh.' In that great truth heaven was and has remained open." The cries of earth, the answers of heaven, are like angels evermore ascending and descending on the Word-made-flesh. It is perfectly true, though in a different sense than that which Thorns adopts it, that this prehistory (<span class="accented">vorgeschichte</span>) is the <span class="accented">vorgeschichte</span> of Christendom, as of each soul becoming Christian, the different eventualities which lead from one revelation to another betoken the several stations on the blessed pilgrimage (<span class="accented">heilsweg</span>).

The complete glorification of Jesus in his resurrection. The record pauses for the awful day of that great sabbath, and resumes the marvelous recital when the greatest event in the history of the world is assumed and asserted to have taken place. Heathen and foes admit the fact of the death of Jesus; the evidence is overwhelming, multiform, sufficient to establish itself to the ordinary reason of mankind. It is a matter of indubitable history. The proof was given to all the world; but it is otherwise with the fact of the anastasis of Jesus. That stupendous event was revealed to the eye and mind of faith by a series of communications, which afford to different classes, groups, kinds, and states of mind specimens of the manner and quality of the resurrection-life. "Many infallible proofs" wrought (as St. Luke says, <a href="../../par/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>.) irresistible conviction as to the reality of the Resurrection. The Church of Christ was originated by a faith in this new and transcendental mode of existence. A generation of men passed, scores of communities were called into being throughout Palestine, Phoenicia, Syria, Lybia, Asia Minor, Achaia, Macedonia, Cyprus, Crete, and even in Italy and the capital of the Roman empire, all of them held together by the life-giving conviction of the reality of a world of spiritual body, into which the redeemed enter. Of this reality the resurrection-life of Christ was the type, the proof, the first fruit, and the earnest. This most astounding fact was preached in Galatia and Macedonia, in Corinth and Rome, in Babylon and Alexandria, before one word of the Gospels had been put on parchment. When the preaching of the apostles was reduced to written form, it was not with the idea of recording a fully detailed or easily harmonizable account of the Easter Day, or of providing rational, or juridical, or historic evidence of the method or order of the great events, but rather to provide five independent series of evidences to the revelations which the apostles and apostolic company received of the nature and quality of the new life for humanity which had now begun. Several details of profound interest occur in the synoptic narrative, concerning which John is silent - such e.g. as the rolling of a stone to the door of the sepulcher, the sealing of the stone by the Roman guard, the resurrection-appearances of the saints, the special preparation made by the women for further embalmment on the following days the great earthquake, the two companies of women that resorted to the sepulcher at successive intervals of time, and the different signs and even appearances by which their timorous hope was quickened into an adoring homage and world-compelling faith. Though John does not recite these well-known narratives, he presupposes some of them. Thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> although, unlike the synoptists, he says nothing of the stone that was rolled to the door of the sepulcher, yet (ver. 1) he refers to the fact that (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the stone was taken up or away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Although he says nothing of the two groups of women, yet he implies that Mary Magdalene was not alone at the sepulcher (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>): "We know not where they have laid him." With far greater particularity than St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>), he describes Peter's visit to the sepulcher, and gives further details of facts which occurred at more than one interview between our Lord and his apostles, of which Luke and Mark had given a more shadowy outline (cf. here vers. 19-25 with <a href="../../par/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>). But we are not intending here to produce a history or harmony of these records, but to follow throughout the impressions produced by the Lord's self-manifestation upon the mind of the beloved disciple; not passing over the difficulties which his peculiar experiences have occasioned, when brought side by side with the synoptic and Pauline narratives. John first of all (vers. 1-10) describes how he came to believe personally in the resurrection of Jesus; then (vers. 11-18) the way in which the first manifestation was made to Mary of Magdala (vers. 19-23); how ten of the apostles, including himself, received a full and satisfying assurance of the stupendous fact (vers. 24-29); how once more, after an interval of eight days, not only Thomas, the most anxious, doubting, and incredulous of the eleven, but the entire group, came into full persuasion, not only of Christ's resurrection, but of his Divine nature and claims, his Messiahship and Sonship, and of their own personal possession of life in him and through him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The process of John's own personal conviction, by the discovery that the sepulcher was deserted. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now on the first day of the week</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, in the plural, is used for the whole of the week, sabbaton including in itself the various days that intervened between sabbath and sabbath, the first, second, third, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span> here and in <a href="../../par/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a> corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>. of <a href="../../par/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). All the evangelists agree about the day of the week, which thenceforward became the new beginning of weeks, "the Lord's day." <span class="cmt_word">Cometh Mary</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Magdalene</span>. Here all the evangelists are at one, although, judging from the synoptists, she must have been accompanied by other women. This is implied in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2, though Meyer repudiates such a hint by the remark that, in addressing the angels, she uses the singular, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>; but this difference rather confirms, than otherwise, the significance of the plural, when she first breaks on the ear of the astonished disciples the wondrous news. But when she is confronted by the angels she is manifestly alone, and speaks for herself. It is probable that Mary Magdalene had preceded the other women, driven by the intensity of her adoring love and abounding grief, and hence some slight divergency appears as to the time at which she started on her pilgrimage. <span class="cmt_word">While it was yet dark</span>, early, in the depth of the dawn (<a href="../../par/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>); before the breaking of full day, and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;</span>, "exceeding early" of Mark, although, as he adds, after sunrise (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bb;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). This latter expression is difficult to reconcile as a statement of identical time. But many simple suppositions would explain the discrepancy. The Magdalene's home may have been at a greater distance from the sepulcher, down in the shadows of the eastern hills, while the home of the other Marys may have been readily accessible to the sepulcher. After the great earthquake described by Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>), and the supernatural darkness of the day but one before, there is no incompatibility in the twofold statement that it was yet dark (not night), although the sun had risen. A deep pall may yet be hanging over the world and place which had held in its bosom the body of the murdered Lord of glory. (She) cometh to the sepulcher, obviously with the purpose stated by all the synoptics. She was bringing the spices which she, with others, had bought on the Friday evening. They would not be behind Nicodemus and Joseph in the expression of their boundless love. The critics make merry over the superfluousness of these women purchasing fresh spices when they must have known the lavish expenditure of the two rich men upon the same design. But the combination of the two statements is absolutely true to nature; it is exactly what women would do all the world over, and an evidence of the authenticity of both narratives. <span class="cmt_word">And seeth the stone taken away out of the sepulcher.</span> This is all the information that St. John gives us, as antecedent to Mary's flight to Simon Peter and himself. We have to decide between three hypotheses: either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> John's narrative entirely differs from the synoptic account of what Mary saw and heard, and what she brought as her contribution to the apostles' ears, and therefore discredits one or the other or both narratives; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Mary of Magdala, having preceded the other women, found the empty sepulcher, and, without waiting for them, rushed to the home of Peter and John with this preliminary intelligence and nothing else, then, returning with them to the tomb, joined the ether women who had arrived after John and Peter had withdrawn; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> That (Hengstenberg) Mary said more than she is reported by John to have uttered, - that she told them not merely that they (the Jews) had taken away the body, but that she had seen a vision of angels, who affirmed that the Lord had risen, and gave certain commissions. From Luke's account of the first effect of the news from the tomb, the apostles thought them idle tales, but they went to the sepulcher, and found it even as the women had said, but him they saw not. What were the "idle tales"? Not that the tomb was empty, for that was a simple matter of fact, which the two chief apostles verified, but the story of angels who affirmed that Jesus was alive. Still, such a report is very likely to have roused the apostles to the eagerness of their first visit to the tomb, and the effect of it to reappear in the conversation of the disciples on their way to Emmaus. If the third of these hypotheses be followed, then the narrative of John simply records with brevity what the other evangelists had reported at greater length, distinctly omitting the story of the angelic visitors, given in all three synoptists. This seems to me the fairest and best interpretation of the four narratives. On this hypothesis the account which Mary Magdalene brought to Peter and John corresponds with Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6-8</a>), where the women generally ran with the news, blending fear with great joy, excited beyond all parallel with the strange wonderful assurance which they had received, that they should meet their risen Lord in Galilee. According to Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1-8</a>), we hear of angels, the sight of the vacated tomb, and the angelic message to the apostles, specifying Peter as one especially singled out to hear the commission. Trembling, ecstasy, fear, shut their mouths as they hurried to the abode of the eleven; they spake nothing to any man, but the intelligence was conveyed "to the eleven and all the rest" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-9.htm">Luke 24:9</a>). St. Luke afterwards sums up in one statement all the various messages that were brought, and mentions by name, not only the Magdalene but Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and says, "the remaining ones with them" (at <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The effect was so far fruitless; the apostles did not believe the words (<a href="../../par/luke/24-10.htm">Luke 24:10</a>). The fact stands in the synoptics that the first communication which was carried by women to the apostles, and was not confined to them, consisted not only of the fact of the empty tomb, but of the language of angels. The first thing might easily have been set to rest by direct inspection; the other part of the narrative might easily be disregarded as the voice of wild enthusiasm and excited imagination. It should be distinctly perceived that the women must have scattered in diffusing their intelligence, and John positively asserts that the main strain of Mary's report was as to the opening of the tomb and disappearance of the body, and that it was delivered personally to himself and Peter. This solution of the first difficulty was thrown into confusion by the T.R. form of Matthew's account, which says (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>), "As they went to bring his disciples word, behold Jesus met them." If that were the true text of Matthew, it is in irreconcilable antagonism with John's Gospel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if Mary Magdalene must be regarded as one of the party who were advised to tell the apostles that the tomb was opened and rifled, and that the Lord was risen. It would also be opposed to the statements of both Luke and Mark concerning the first message they brought to the apostles and to the rest, as well as the manner of their departure from the sepulcher. If, however, Matthew is here referring to a second party (called by harmonists the Joanna group), then they must, in their passage to the apostles, have missed Peter and John on their way to and from the sepulcher, and it would contradict the assertion of all four evangelists, that Mary Magdalene was the first to see the Lord. This most difficult clause in Matthew's account has, however, been rejected by modern critics, and consequently  the narrative of Matthew is delivered from its greatest perplexity. The fact that Jesus met them must be identical with the appearance described with far greater detail in John's own statement (vers. 11-18). Matthew's Gospel throughout is singularly devoid of notices of time, and we find grouped here, as elsewhere, events or teachings without chronological perspective. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then she runneth</span> in advance of the other women, who are each intent on communicating what she had seen and heard, <span class="cmt_word">and cometh to Simon Peter</span> - why not, if, as Mark says, Peter had been specially mentioned by the angel? - <span class="cmt_word">and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved</span>.

We know not what other burying-place "they" have chosen! The anti-harmonistic commentators, with ponderous literalism, insist that Mary could have said nothing more. A gushing woman like Mary of Magdala uttered one sentence, and that was all: It is, however, entirely evident that she must have said enough to excite great wonderment, haste, and activity in the breasts of these two disciples (see above on the three hypotheses).

This is a fact affirmed also by Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>), "But Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher."

(<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is used instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 2 or the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> of <a href="../../par/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; but it is clear from the form of the following sentence, that <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x37e;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is different in meaning from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and does not mean "right into," but "towards.") John, as the younger man, would soon outstrip the elderly disciple; and he simply records what in one sense is an insignificant detail, but one that could never be forgotten by him. There is no disposition to magnify himself, as Peter's part is obviously the more conspicuous. John runs more rapidly from his youth, the fervor of his nature, and the warmth of his affection; the reflection that he might have directly to convey the strange news to the mother of his Lord assisted to hurry him.

It was a necessary preliminary of the subsequent act of Peter, though Luke does not refer to it. Peter himself uses the same word (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). It means literally "bending on one side," with a desire to gaze intently on an object (Ecclus. 14:23 Ecclus. 21:23; <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He seeth the linen clothes lying</span> (see <a href="../../par/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a>), untenanted and unused, those very cerecloths which he had helped to wind round the sacred, wounded body, with their affluence of sweet spices. <span class="cmt_word">Yet entered he not within</span>. Awe, reverence, mystery, fear, nascent hope, the thought most possibly, "Not here, but risen," began to dawn faintly on his mind.

Weft-stein, on <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, adds, "no pollueretur," and quotes numerous Talmudieal authorities to show how the corpse and the grave and gravestone would pollute the living (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). If so, then Peter, before he came to the conclusion that there was no death in the sepulcher, broke a ritual law which John respected. There seems also rabbinical authority for the fact that disciples might carry "the just" to their grave without such tear of pollution. But at this moment they were both lifted above the region of ritual altogether. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - John stood gazing, waiting, wondering, and, while doing this, <span class="cmt_word">then cometh Simon Peter following him</span> across the very garden which must have borne many marks of the dreadful tragedy that had been hurriedly terminated before the commencement of the sabbath. The expression, "following him," may refer to what Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>) says that Peter did, viz. that he too stooped down and looked as John had done. Westcott says, "without a look or pause." But why need we suppose a point-blank contradiction of Luke? Such a mode of entrance is almost unthinkable. But he did more: <span class="cmt_word">And entered into the sepulcher</span>. How strangely impulsive this man! how characteristic of every other recorded action of Peter! There must have been a Peter who corresponded to the four- or five-fold portraiture of the evangelistic history. The last time that Peter saw his Lord was when a "look" of his cruelly insulted Friend and Master had broken his own heart; yet now he was rushing impulsively to gaze again upon that face with, so far as he knew, all the marks of infernal insult yet upon it. The contrast of character between John and Peter is everywhere maintained. John, in <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, first recognizes the Lord; Peter hurries through the waters to fall once more at his feet. John is lost in silent meditations; Peter exclaims, and wonders. <span class="cmt_word">And he beholdeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, with a closer and more careful, vivid, and instructive gaze, not merely <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, the word used by John of his own conduct) <span class="cmt_word">the linen cloths lying, and the napkin</span> (sudarium, schweisstueh) <span class="cmt_word">which was</span> (had been) <span class="cmt_word">upon his head</span>.

It was clear, then, that the body had not been carried away for another burial, nor had it been hastily removed, seeing that there were signs of deliberation, choice, and care. All that was suggested by this wonderful appearance of the grave, all that it means to us, we cannot fathom. The new life has raiment of its own, belonging to a higher region of existence, woven in spiritual looms; yet the hands that unwound these bandages and head-cloth, and laid them as Peter and John saw them, were capable of physical exertions and activity. What dogmatic hints are involved in this recital! He is a living Person, not an abstract principle or vague force. There are evident proofs that, however great the change which had passed over him, the Living One was the same man that he had ever been.

The writer, whoever he was, emphasizes his own smaller courage, his tardy recognition of the fact; but he adds, <span class="cmt_word">And he saw, and believed.</span> According to Augustine, Erasmus, and Luther, he believed what Mary had said. He saw now that the tomb was empty, and believed her report, whether it went on to describe the first angelic message or not; but Lucke, Lange, Meyer, and Moulton, following Chrysostom, etc., rightly interpret "he believed" that Jesus had not been taken by others from the grave. He saw there were no signs of haste or confusion, or of a rifled tomb. He believed that he had risen, that this death of his had been done away, that he was living, as he said. This is one of the most vivid indications that the writer assumes acquaintance with the most inward experience of that disciple whom Jesus loved. Luke says that "Peter wondered in himself at that which had happened." John tells us that, from that moment, the whole thing flashed upon himself. There was something for him to see which shed a burning light upon Holy Scripture, upon the promises and acts of Jesus; and he "believed" in the triumph which had been achieved. Godet thinks more - he believed in the Messiah-ship and Sonship in a sense which had not dawned upon him before. The apostle seems to link himself with those who had the smaller and less perfect benediction subsequently pronounced upon Thomas.

Here, again, there is a vivid touch of individuality. John's own home contained the mother of the Lord. Around Peter were gathered the other apostles, and they were shortly to be joined by John himself. To them the more detailed report of the language of the angel would be repeated a hundred times. The "other Mary," Salome, Joanna, all press the wondrous assurance upon the eleven, as they mourned and wept, and for the most part were either bewildered or unbelieving. The two disciples start for Emmaus, and all that these knew as yet was that "certain women affirmed the tomb to be empty, that they had seen a vision of angels, which declared him to be alive," and "that certain of our company had visited the sepulcher, and found it even as the women 'had said, but him they saw not" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-22.htm">Luke 24:22-24</a>).

Some have said two white-robed Essenes like those who are also supposed to have appeared to our Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration, his secret friends, who had really spirited the body of Jesus away, lingered yet in the tomb, and duped Mary by a lying story. Scorning this hypothesis, legendarists have said - Here we see the subjective creation of the terrified and weeping women, who took white clothes for men or angels, and whose fancies were readily believed; while mythical hypotheses have suggested that a glamour of love, many years after the event, created a pathetic and beautiful fiction of what may have happened on that memorable dawn. Every one of these interpretations vanishes before the authenticity of John's Gospel. The disciple whom Jesus loved, the author of the Apocalypse, was personally acquainted with Mary of Magdala, and had much communion with her, and could heartily believe her story. If there be no spiritual world, no kind nor modes of existence beyond what we call the seen and temporal, and no thought higher than man's thought; if every testimony to this spiritual world right through the ages is a delusion, and can be explained away; if it be an irrational or impossible supposition; - why, then this vision must pass away with the rest. But the entire teaching of the Bible from end to end reveals and bears witness to a world ordinarily unseen by human eyes, but none the less real. To some the door thus opened into heaven is closed and sealed by the seven seals of materialism, agnosticism, dogmatism, scientism, worldliness, indifference, and unspirituality. How much do men forget that all human life is but a very temporary, ever-vanishing robe around a permanent and abiding spirit! that it is entirely conceivable that even pure spirit can come for our advantage into still more evanescent forms than those we now possess, which yet make appeal to what we call our senses of sight and hearing! Objective as such manifestations are, they are no more visible to all eyes or ears than the mysteries of art are open to all human sensibility. The harmonies of heaven are not heard by those who are muffled up with vesture of decay, and there is nothing lying beyond or behind the veil of sense to the unspiritual. The whole critical school might have rambled about the garden, with hammer and spectacles, and would never have seen an angel or the risen Christ; but, thank God, all eyes were not so dim. Some were there who saw and believed; and they have revolutionized the world's thought. Their vision is the key of time; their voice, the word that wakes the dead. This manifestation of the unseen world does not contradict the statement of Matthew that an angel of the Lord had been seen sitting on the displaced stone, and terrified the Roman guard; nor Mark's assurance that the women had seen a young man clothed in a white robe, who gave the Divine assurance which perplexed the eleven; nor Luke's description of two men clothed in glittering apparel, who told them that the Lord was living. Surely it is impossible to represent Mary of Magdala's present vision as identical with that which had occurred at an earlier hour; but it is clear that, if she shared in the earlier vision at all, she had not been convinced by it, for still she wept in utter despair. The fact that these angelic appearances should take different forms to different witnesses belongs to their very nature. Such visions, translated into words, would naturally differ. If there had been rigid uniformity in the statements of the three evangelists, and of the fourth with them, grave suspicion would have been attached to the entire recital. The experiences of several different women would be repeated a thousand times. They would be questioned separately and together in every possible way; and it appears from all four narratives that three forms of the ultimate traditions alike declare that hope and fear arising from the empty grave were quickened and stimulated by angelic ambassadors, who variously prepared their mind to receive the grand objective fact.

Here we witness angelic wonder at human incredulity. Angelic ministry to human sorrow; for the mystery of our tears does not arrest the sympathy of these triumphant spirits. Often, if we are compelled to put into words the supposed cause of our bitterest agony, we deliver ourselves from our fears. <span class="cmt_word">She saith unto them,</span> as if she were speaking simply and naturally to human beings. However, Mary of Magdala alone of the women knows them to be "angels," but is so overpowered with the loss of her Lord that she does not quail or flee, but wails forth anew the language she had already uttered to the disciples. <span class="cmt_word">I weep because they have taken away my Lord.</span> That "my" makes a characteristic difference from "the Lord" of whom she had spoken to Peter and John. She did not at the instant know that her Lord was the Lord of angels.

But strange, mysterious, unutterably wonderful, entirely and absolutely inconsistent with the hypothesis, to which we have often referred, that this book is a theological romance, John, on Mary's own authority, adds, <span class="cmt_word">She knew not that it was Jesus.</span> This is one of those remarkably vivid and autoptic touches that carry conviction of truth, whatever may be the explanation or the conclusion to be drawn from it. How far was this lack of recognition due to her, and how far to this the first manifestation made of "spiritual body" to human ken? Some have frigidly taken a commonplace explanation. Her eyes were blinded with continuous weeping; or the darkness of the morning; or Jesus may have stood in the shadows of the city wall, as the glare of the first beam of sunrise broke out of the purple mists on the Moab hills; or Christ's appearance was so changed by the agony through which he had passed, and by the recovery and reconstitution of his humanity, that the signs of his identity were obscured. He could not have clothed himself with the glittering garments of the Transfiguration, or with the dazzling robes of angels; for she mistook him for the keeper of the garden, either for Joseph of Arimathaea himself or his steward. "She knew not that it was Jesus." Human eyes are often holden so that they do not see the Lord, even when by some objective manifestation he makes it possible to do this thing. Thus (<a href="../../par/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>), "Manoah knew not that it was the angel of the Lord." And several other of the theophanies of the Old Testament, encountering the blindness of human vision, slowly dawn upon even prophetic intelligence. Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, are all instances. And we find that in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16, 17</a>, "some doubted" the Resurrection, even when the vision led others to adore (<a href="../../par/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>). The eyes of Cleophas and his friend were holden, even though their hearts were burning. Those who traveled with Paul to Damascus saw a light and heard a sound, but they did not see nor did they hear what the apostle saw and heard. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> of the risen Jesus was not, according to Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>), always the same. For the vision and perception of this mode of being, the eye needs special training and preparation. Though the eyes of love are the quickest to discern these wondrous realities, yet the vision tarries, and is for an appointed time, and even they who ultimately see have to wait for it.

And Matthew's summation of the entire narrative makes it clear that she was at least one of the first group who saw the risen Lord. He recalls her to herself. He seeks to assuage the grief of desolation, the bitterness of despairing love. As his first great Beatitudes had been "Blessed are the poor in spirit," "Blessed are those who mourn and weep," and "Blessed are the meek," so the first words he uttered after he rose from the dead were intended to console human weeping over the most irremediable of human sorrows. They are the beginning of a fulfillment of the Divine promise "to wipe away tears from off all faces." But the Lord adds, <span class="cmt_word">Whom seekest thou</span>? She has lost some one, not some thing. Questions these which he has been asking the souls of men and women ever since, when their grief and tears, their unconscious and unsatisfied yearnings after himself, have confused their perceptions and riven their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">She, supposing him to be the gardener</span>, a friend, not a stranger, a disciple, not a Roman soldier or a hostile priest, perhaps some man who had been with Joseph of Arimathaea on the Friday evening, or even the senator himself, <span class="cmt_word">said to him, Lord</span>, (Sir,) <span class="cmt_word">if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> This passionate burst reveals the blinding dominance of a fixed idea. She had no notion of the Resurrection. She was utterly overwhelmed with one bitter, cruel thought. The sacred body was to be embalmed with the precious spices which she had spent her all to buy. Others have forestalled her. Perhaps unsympathizing hands have been doing their worst. She does not know, in her terrified grief, if some wicked hands have not cast out his body into the Valley of Hinnom. She seems to imply that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> has heard the words of the angels, and her previous reply to them. She is so filled with one thought, that the him, not it, explains itself. She is reckless of herself, and does not stay to count the cost. Had she not poured the precious ointment on his feet, in happier days, and washed them with her tears? Of whom can she speak but of him who said, "Thy sins, which are many, are forgiven;" "She loved much;" "Thy faith hath saved thee"? So far all is preparation for the great revelation. "The Lord has risen indeed;" but, unlike what poetry or theology might have pictured, or the mythopceic faculty have woven out of its strong persuasion of the Lord's indissoluble life, he has chosen first of all to present this signal manifestation of spiritual corporeity to a loving heart crushed with grief, to one groaning over irreparable wrong, without a spark of hope, that death was indeed vanquished. But she who received the objective presentation was too much preoccupied to feel her footing and her home in two worlds. It was not "an enthusiast (une hallucinee, Renan) who gave the world (un Dieu ressuscite) a resuscitated God," but a doubter, a despairing, broken-hearted sufferer, who did not know him when she saw him.

The more general expression, "woman" (ver. 15), makes her seem to us the representative of the whole of suffering humanity, weeping over the inability to find any link of fellowship between itself and the invisible God, feeling unconsciously after the Christ and haply not finding him, weeping because hostility had obliterated him or superstition had concealed him, while all the while he is near at hand. But now Jesus stirred the affection of the living, weeping person at his side by uttering her own name in tones that thrilled her to the heart, and created the new sublime conviction that he had risen, as he said. She turned herself, as though the previous glance had been momentary and partial, and now the vision and voice blended, and she knew him. <span class="cmt_word">And saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabbouni</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is here introduced by modern editors, This word only occurs in this Gospel and the Apocalypse), <span class="cmt_word">a word</span> (the evangelist adds) <span class="cmt_word">which is to say, Master</span>. The Hebrew term  - probably preserved in its Galilaean form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, rabbouni, rather than in the ordinary form (see Authorized Version) <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, rabboni - if strictly translated, would be "my Teacher," or "my Master," yet the personal pronoun must not be pressed. It doubtless had lost its specialty as we find in many other languages (monsieur, mein herr, "my Lord," are familiar instances). Even if the full force of the pronoun were urged, Mary's faith had not gone beyond the ideal of her devotedly loved Teacher, Friend, Master, and fell far short of the insight which even the incredulous Thomas would soon exhibit, that the Lord had put on Divine glory, and filled all things. She apparently fell in speechless, passionate affection at his feet, as the other women did shortly afterwards (see <a href="../../par/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>); but with the idea that now the old relations between Teacher and loving disciples would be resumed. She was in no mood answering to the doubtfulness of the disciples who desired proof of his identity, of the fact of his corporeity, before they could understand his claim to be their perpetual Guide, and his promise to be with them "unto the end of the world;" but she thought at once of the old life in Galilee. Her joy knew no bounds, but her conception of the reality of that which was revealed to her was most imperfect. It was the realization of love rather than the perception of intellect. She rushed hastily to a very limited conclusion; and she suffered an obvious correction, if not repulse, which has been interpreted in many ways. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <i>to</i> my God, and your God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for</span>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some, Bengal and others, make the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> govern the whole clause that follows, and so give the meaning," Stay not to touch me, but haste to my disciples, and say," etc.; but this would render the first clause very obscure, unless the further supposition be made, as by Baur, Bush, Sears, and many others, that our Lord was just on the point of ascending to heaven, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of one (nay, the first) of his many ascensions to the Father, after which the touching, in the sense either of worship or of verification, would be possible and rightful, and also the supposition that an "ascension" intervened between the appearance to the Magdalene and the other women, or at all events before the revelation to the disciples at Emmaus, to Simon Peter, or to the eleven, at all of which both verification of his personality, if net worship at his feet, was permitted or encouraged. This hypothesis is perilously near to an assumption of a succession of illusive visions of that which had nothing but subjective reality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Olshausen and Schleiermacher give the utterly naturalistic view, that the Lord's spiritual body was so tender that he could not bear a vigorous grasp or physical touch. Still worse, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Paulus supposed that he was still suffering from his cruel wounds, which, of course, would only imply an apparent death on the cross, and is a denial of the Resurrection altogether. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Meyer's view seems to imply that Mary wondered whether he had only a glorified spirit without bodily form, and she wished to verify the latter by handling his Person, and "Jesus gives her by his verbal assurance the certainty she seeks, adding, <span class="cmt_word">For I am not yet ascended to the</span> (<span class="cmt_word">my</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>; therefore as yet I am not a glorified spirit who has again come down from heaven, whither he had ascended." This is very subtle, and is equivalent to our Lord's saying, "Do not you, Mary, seek that kind of bodily tangible proof;" "I am not yet a glorified spirit, and have not yet the glorified body which you imagined." The difficulty of this interpretation is not what Godet says, "Jesus glorified does not become pure spirit," but that Mary is credited with a breadth and depth of apprehension so far in advance of her apparent despondency and her small amount of faith in the dignity of her Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Many take the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Hold me not fast," as though <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> were equal to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to hold fast," or to hold for purposes of enjoyment, and imply that Mary rushed to "embrace" our Lord (Hengstenberg and Bruckner), to clasp him by the knees or feet; that Jesus warned and repulsed the effort, implying that he repressed the exuberance of the joy which she manifested, pointing to a much higher and holier contact that would be possible when his glorification would be complete. Augustine ('Tract. in Io.,' 121:3), "' Touch me not,' that is, Believe not thus on me according to thy present notions. For how could it be otherwise than carnally that she still believed on him whom she was weeping over as a man? For I am not yet ascended to my Father.' There shalt thou touch me when thou believest me to be God in no wise unequal to the Father." Leo the Great ('Sermo,' 74. 100. 4, quoted by P. Schaff): "I am unwilling that you should approach me (carnaliter) by any mere physical touch, that you should recognize me by the physical senses (sensu carnis). I am drawing you to sublimer things; I am preparing greater things for you. When I shall have ascended to the Father, then you will handle me more perfectly and truly, being ready, as you then will be, to apprehend what you do not touch, and to believe that which you do not perceive." Many of the most able of modern expositors adopt this view or some modification of it (Calvin, Melancthon, Lampe, De Wette, and Tholuck); Luthardt now sees a difficulty in this interpretation, from the twofold sense thus attributed to the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and falls back on the earlier view, "Cling not to me, but go and tell my disciples," etc. Godet, however, puts it thus: "I have not yet reached the state by means of' which I shall be able to live with you in the communion which I promised you;" and many of the ecclesiastical divines discover in the words an allusion to sacramental communion which will be possible in the future, when the dispensation of the Holy Spirit shall have beau inaugurated. The ascension of which he speaks is not of one definitive act, but of a continual state (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), and so the idea of the repeated ascensions is precluded. The difficulty arises from the permission the Lord gave to the eleven to prove by tangible evidence, by visible signs, the reality of his resurrection, showing them by way of identification the marks upon his person of the great agony. But there is no need to suppose that Mary was refused one touch when she seemed wishful to cling to his feet, and thus redouble the conviction already wrought in her by sight and hearing of his new mode of being. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> has this double meaning, "to handle" and "to hold fast." The key of the passage is in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>, "not yet have I ascended to the Father;" and the reasonable, nay, the imperative, inference is that when he shall have ascended to the Father, there will be ample opportunity for that spiritual communion with him which will make him for ever present with his Church. The goal of all Christ's teaching (as recorded by John) is his return to the Father, and the consequent fullness of his disciples' joy. Because he will be glorified straightway in God himself, he will henceforth be as near to them, as competent to teach and guide and protect them, as in the days of his flesh; nay, more so, for they will do greater works than he wrought before them, because he goes to the Father, ascending up to where he was before (<a href="../../par/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18-21, 23, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-14.htm">John 16:14, 17</a>). He will be "seated at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens," he will pass "through these heavens, that he may fill all things." Because he is "the Lamb in the midst of the throne," he will lead them to the living fountains of water. Because he is on the eternal throne, he can dwell in them and manifest himself to them. <span class="cmt_word">But go to my brethren</span>. The new name, dearer than "slaves," than "servants," than "disciples," than "ministers," than "apostles," than "friends;" one that involves in itself an eternal inheritance. Observe that, though our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-48.htm">Matthew 12:48</a>, etc.) had prepared the way for this unspeakable privilege, it is not until he has put on the life eternal, the life of victory over death, that he freely confers this lofty designation upon that timid and dispirited band of special followers who had forsaken him and fled in his great humiliation. Peter especially (<a href="../../par/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>) receives this significant assurance and (<a href="../../par/luke/24-34.htm">Luke 24:34</a>) confirms its realization together with Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>). These eleven men are henceforth his brethren. <span class="cmt_word">And say to them, I am ascending</span>; the process of ascension has begun; I am beginning to assume all the prerogatives of spiritual corporeity; I am clothing myself with my eternal form; I have laid down my life, that I might take it again, and use it for the highest blessedness of my brethren. <span class="cmt_word">I am ascending to my Father, and to your Father</span>. Let it be observed that he does not say, "to our Father." "He who is Father of Christ and Father of men, is so in different ways. He is Father of Christ by nature and of men by grace" (Westcott). "He saith not 'our Father;' in one sense, therefore, is he mine, in another sense yours; by nature mine, by grace yours" (Augustine). <span class="cmt_word">To my God, and your God</span>. The same remark may be made here. Christ does speak of "my God" from the throne of glory (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-2.htm">Revelation 3:2, 12</a>). His human consciousness of God has throughout been unique; his eternal consciousness of the Father's love dignified all his human relations with the Father, and became the true inspiration of all consciousness of God possessed by his disciples. "He appears in the presence [before the face] of God for us," and so we have access unto one Father and draw near to God. Nevertheless, he did not say to "our God," any more than to "our Father." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a></div><div class="verse">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and <i>that</i> he had spoken these things unto her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mary the Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples</span>. She rushes at once with speed and zeal, and the word is on her tongue, <span class="cmt_word">I have seen</span> (she does not say, I have grasped him by the hand, or kissed his feet) <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="accented">how<span class="cmt_word"></span> that he said these things to her.</span> This special message, not recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>, was clearly not given to the women who held his feet. Some harmonists endeavor to identify the narrative in Matthew with this passage and others to make Matthew's narrative identical with the account of the revelations made to Joanna's party at a later hour, and therefore entirely distinct from this (see Commentaries on Matthew, Luke, and Mark). John's account is free from ambiguity in itself, whereas the rapid summary given in Luke and the general impression produced by the whole group of events, as recorded by Matthew, suggest the need of supplementary intelligence. The narratives of the synoptists, then, record that in the course of this Easter Day a company of women who may reasonably be supposed to be those who bore the names of Joanna, Susanna, and others, and who had gone to the tomb with their spices, had been met by the Lord himself, either going or returning, and had received the summons to tell the disciples that he would see them in Galilee. The two disciples on their way to Emmaus had at length discovered that the mysterious stranger who accosted them and discoursed so fully was the Lord himself. They returned to Jerusalem to affirm the fact, and found the eleven rejoicing that the Lord had risen indeed, and that "he had appeared to Simon Peter." It would certainly seem, and is at length admitted by all, that the narrative given in the following verses of events occurring on the late evening of the Easter Day could be none other than that which Luke describes (<a href="../../par/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>). This is rendered somewhat perplexing by the record of <a href="../../par/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>, that the language of the two disciples was not accepted by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "the rest." But it is obvious from every one of the narratives how slow of heart even the apostles themselves were to accept the assurance of such unexpected and wonderful phenomena. The extreme dejection of the disciples, followed by their vigorous and invincible faith, is testified by each evangelist; but from the nature of the ease the resurrection of Jesus was, during the course of the entire day, doubted by some. The nature of the doubt, and the method in which it was put to rest, is portrayed in some detail by John (see note on ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then the same day at evening, being the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The manifestation to the ten disciples, corresponding with the second portion of the prayer, and followed by special conference of privilege. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When therefore it was evening, on that day, being the first day of the week</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the close of the day on which the Lord had risen; on "that day" which became so memorable in the history of the Church. Consequently, after most astounding and independent revelations had been made to several individuals, about 8 p.m. there occurred that which John now proceeds to describe. The note of time identifies it with the scene and event described by Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36-43</a>); consequently John had the former account before him in the record of his own reminiscences. To understand the full force of the passage we must bring to it the statements of Luke, Mark, and Paul. The disciples had been prepared, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the reports of the women, that the grave had been opened and was empty, and that angelic appearances had asserted the resurrection of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> By the impression made on Peter and John when they found it as Mary and the other women had said. The disappearance of the body of Jesus, confirmed by the four independent lines of testimony, is strangely difficult to account for on any hypothesis except that of the Resurrection. The disciples were evidently confounded by the fact. The Pharisees and priestly party were quite aware that such an event would checkmate their supposed victory over a hated rival. The Roman soldiers were pledged in honor and by pride and passion not to allow themselves thus to be reduced to impotence. Hence there is no explanation of the rise or beginning of such a legend (see B. Weiss, 'Life of Jesus,' 3. pp. 390-395), except the historical fact. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> By an assertion of the Magdalene that she had seen the Lord, and that he had sent a special message to his brethren as to the completion of his glorification in his ascent to the Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> By the announcement, the details of which are not recited, concerning an appearance to Peter: this fact stands on remarkably strong evidence of Mark, Luke, and Paul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> By the immense excitement of the appearance and disappearance of the Lord at Emmaus. This was evinced by the return of the two disciples to Jerusalem, charged with new ideas of the meaning of the Scriptures and of the will and power of God, and with fundamentally new notions of the very nature of spiritual body - body entirely and absolutely under the power of the spirit. The apostles were prepared for the wonderful manifestation of a new mode of being; but they needed something more convincing than they had yet received. They were still suffering from intellectual blindness and slowness of spirit, and were apparently incapable of accepting mere testimony. Mark's statement (<a href="../../par/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>) embraces the special scene which John describes in much more vivid and instructive manner (vers. 26-29). But Luke expressly implies that far more than the eleven had gathered together, either in the room where the Paschal supper had been celebrated, or where the election of Matthias subsequently took place. Joseph and Nicodemus, the women, and some of the seventy disciples were there; nor can we conceive excluded from their fellowship Mary of Bethany, or Lazarus, or Simon the Cyreman, or the "brothers of the Lord" so designated. We are told that after the arrival of the Emmaus disciples, <span class="cmt_word">the doors having been locked</span> (shut) <span class="cmt_word">where the disciples were</span> [assembled ] <span class="cmt_word">because of the</span> (their) <span class="cmt_word">fear of the Jews</span>. This expression is once again repeated (ver. 26), showing that, after the lapse of seven days, fear and precautions against surprise still prevailed. They were on both occasions in ignorance of the purpose or meaning of the Sanhedrin, nor could they tell whether the malice of the world would at once compel them to follow their Lord's example, drink of his cup, and be baptized with his baptism. The doors were closed, when <span class="cmt_word">Jesus came, and stood in the midst</span> - a phrase which is here identical with that in Luke's narrative. Now, John, who, consonantly with Luke, has recorded his evidence that the body of Christ was not a phantasmal imagination, but a veritable, visible, and tangible reality (see <a href="../../par/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37-43</a>), identifiable with the very body which had been so cruelly wounded and bruised for them, takes special pains to hint, By a single clause, that the body of Christ was a new creation, and was submitted to laws profoundly different from those which we have generalized from the intimations of the five senses only. John does not say that the doors were opened by some magic process, nor that Christ simply passed through the closed doors, nor that they were miraculously removed; but that he had taken up his position before them by a process which, to the body made of the dust of the earth, would be supremely miraculous. Were we have a revelation made to prepared minds of a new order of existence (see Westcott's 'Revelations of the Risen Lord,' and Milligan's 'Resurrection of Christ,' on the likeness and on the unlikeness of the risen body with that which had died). It is more than possible - nay, it is entirely presumable  - that the spiritual body becomes possessed of additional senses, of which we have no conception or experience; and, therefore, the spirit clothed with such body is alive to properties of matter and dimensions of space and active forces all of which would be supernatural to us, "cribbed, cabined, and confined" as we are now and here. Our Lord, before his Passion, gave numerous proofs of the dominance of his spirit over the body: his repeated escapes from his enemies, the power of his voice and glance, his transfiguration-glory, his superiority to gravitation in walking upon the sea and hushing its storms. So that he, on this occasion, is revealing to the world some of the functions of spiritual corporeity. He is manifesting the kind of life which will eventually be the condition of all the redeemed - visible and tangible at will to those who are limited to our present condition and stage of being, but also in its normal state invisible, impalpable, to eye and touch of mortal sense. There can be little doubt that John deeply recognized what Paul described as "the spiritual body." Jesus stood suddenly in their midst, not a phantasm, as the disciples (or some of them) were ready to suggest. His first word, though consisting in form of the common salutation of the East, must have meant immeasurably more to them than it does in ordinary parlance. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus saith unto them, Peace be to you</span>! which, uttered in well-remembered tones, reminded them of how he had discriminated his "peace," and his manner of giving it from the world's "peace," and the world's manner of giving (<a href="../../par/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). It meant the hushing of their fear, the expulsion of terrible alarm (see <a href="../../par/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37, 38</a>). This is John's summary of all that he said. Luke, with much detail, records how the Lord proved that he was, not a mere subjective vision, but a veritable man, with flesh, and bones, and voice, and power to take food. Consequently the evangelists labor to make evident the fact that the spiritual resurrection-body, though a continuation of the old life, with signs of its identity, is, nevertheless, emancipated from the ordinary conditions of our material corporeity. This is one of the places where the narrative transcends experience and imagination, and appeals to faith in a higher order of being than crosses the field of scientific vision. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-20.htm">John 20:20</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had so said, he shewed unto them <i>his</i> hands and his side.

Igor was this vision of the Lord restricted to the ocular testimony, to the bare fact of the Resurrection, but it was a solemn assurance that he, though risen, had died for them. He is the Living One that was dead, and is alive for evermore. He is in the midst of the throne, a Lamb as it had been slain. In his greatest glory neither does he nor can his people forget his sacrificial death. "He showed them his hands and his side." Some have argued, from John's silence about his" feet," that he intended to correct a general impression which the synoptic narrative had produced, viz. that our Lord's feet had been nailed to the cross. There is no reason whatever for any such hypothesis. The evangelist simply emphasizes the ghastly proof of his Lord's actual death, with its supernatural accompaniments, as a more vivid evidence of identity than the piercing of the feet: moreover, it was a fact to which he had borne special testimony. Some conception is given in both the Gospels of the marks and vestiges of the earthly pilgrimage which will survive death and pass on into the eternal world. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples, therefore, were glad when they saw the Lord.</span> In <a href="../../par/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a> we read that they were incredulous from the excess of their joy, and surcharged with wonder. In the bewilderment of their rapture he added to their assurance, and transformed their joy into faith by publicly and before them all participating in food. Extreme dejection is transformed into triumphant conviction of the truth. A new revelation had been made to them of the very nature of life, while the veil that had from the beginning of time concealed the abode of the blessed dead, had at length been rent in twain. They heard, they saw, they handled, the Word of life. They felt that in their Lord they too were now at home in both worlds. Their fellowship was with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus to them again, Peace <i>be</i> unto you: as <i>my</i> Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Peace, spiration of the Holy Spirit, and conference of power to remit or retain sin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore [Jesus</span><span class="cmt_word">] said unto them again, Peace be unto you.</span> With added emphasis, and in obvious reference to his valedictory discourse, he gave to them the essence of his own sublime repose, the blending of an infinite joy with a measureless sorrow; the equilibrium that springs from the spirit mastering the flesh. Not an ecstatic rapture, nor a joy that would make their life on earth insupportable by its contrast with their abiding frame of mind; but peace - "the peace of God, which passeth understanding." The first "peace" gave to all who were assembled a new revelation; the second "peace," a summons to service. The Lord added the memorable words, <span class="cmt_word">As the Father hath sent me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, hath sent me on a special commission), <span class="cmt_word">I also send you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>, charge you to go forth and accomplish this commission of mine); see Westcott's excursus on the New Testament usage of the two verbs, which does much to justify these shades of meaning. Both verbs are used of both the mission of the Son and the mission of believers, but in the two senses, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that sometimes the special service on which he or they are sent is emphasized by the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that at other times the simple mission or sending forth is the dominant idea when <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is employed. Thus in <a href="../../par/john/4-38.htm">John 4:38</a> the Lord says, "I sent (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor;" and <a href="../../par/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a> (see note) the same word is appropriately used twice - for the Lord's own commission, and also for the commission of the disciples. Then it seems to point back to an event in their history and the work done already and before Christ's death for the world. Now the disciples have a new conception of Christ and of his work, and they must go forth to fulfill it. This usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is more or less conspicuous in <a href="../../par/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-28.htm">John 3:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used often to describe the Father's mission of the Son, the mission of the Comforter, and the mission of the disciples (<a href="../../par/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>). Moulton says, " <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> means 'commission' and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;</span> 'mission.' With the first word our thoughts turn to the 'special embassy;' with the second, to the authority of the ' ambassador' and the obedience of the sent." Another peculiarity of this passage is that the Lord uses the perfect tense, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, rather than the aorist used elsewhere, suggesting a complete commission on his own side, whose meaning and effects are still in operation. Those who have received this revelation are to become at once witnesses to the fact of his resurrection, agents and organs of his Spirit. Moulton suggests that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used in order to enforce the physical separation between the Lord and his disciples; and that we cannot overlook in the similarity of the ideas the difference in the manner of the sending, by the Savior of the disciples, from the manner in which the Son had been sent by the Father. Christ came forth from the eternal companionship of the Father, in the fact of his incarnation, taking humanity up into his eternal substance. The disciples were sent forth by the risen Lord, who had called them by grace into fellowship with himself, and who equipped them for his service. The difference in these two methods of sending is as conspicuous as the resemblance.

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is not elsewhere used in the New Testament, but is used by the LXX. in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> to describe the essential distinction between the living soul of Adam and the living soul of all other animals. Man's life was no evolution of the life in other creatures, or consequence of pre-existent properties in the dust of the ground. A direct volition of the Almighty conferred upon humanity the life of the flesh. So here the second Adam, the life-giving Spirit (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>), was represented as visibly and sensibly conferring on those whom he now sends forth to complete the mission of his grace the Divine life which would make them new creatures, and bestow on them power to generate the same spirit in others. They will have power to do this by bearing testimony to that which they see and know to be the fact of the case. The celebrated passage (<a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>) which asserts the "glorification" of Jesus to be the condition of the mission of the Comforter (cf. <a href="../../par/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>) makes the bestowment of the Spirit on this occasion a proof that the glorification had already begun. Has he not already said to Mary, "I am ascending to my Father"? So now he implies that the. time will come when, though he is sending his disciples forth from his immediate corporeal presence, they will touch him by other faculties than eye, or ear, or hand. He is about to leave them for seven days; they are to learn the reality of his spiritual presence by an earnest of Pentecost, by such a gift of the Spirit that they will recognize, in the rushing mighty wind, the presence of the same uplifting, revealing, supernatural Energy. It is urged by Hofmann, Luthardt, Gess, Moulton, and to some extent Westcott and Coder, that the absence of the article must be represented in the translation, that we have here either "a holy spirit," or an energy, an impersonal force of Spirit, or "a gift of the Holy Spirit," an effusion of Holy Spirit, and not "the Spirit of the Father and Son," not the fullness of the Holy Ghost, not the realization of the Divine indwelling, only an earnest of the sublime reality, a symbolic expression of the promise of the Father. Godet says, "This communication is to the Resurrection what Pentecost will be to the Ascension. As by Pentecost he will initiate them into his ascension, so now he associates them with the life of the Resurrection." This last may be perfectly true; yet <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, with or without article, is "the Holy Spirit" (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>). Meyer says, "The idea of an intermediate Holy Spirit, distinct from the Holy Spirit, lies outside of Scripture." Nor can we minimize the full force of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which emphasizes the special action of Christ, by which he communicated to this first gathering of the Church the sense of his Divine presence, the gift of spiritual insight, the God-consciousness, the experience of two worlds, the unity and community of life with himself, which has been augmenting in positive realization, in vivid proofs, in mighty powers, from that hour to this. Whosoever enters into the sphere of that Divine breath becomes "alive unto God;" his faith is invincible; he comes to know that which passes current experience. This was the beginning of the supernatural life which makes Christian consciousness unique among religious experiences. From that hour the holy world and kingdom in which Christ rules has been an objective fact. It lies far beyond the ken of science, and cannot find any place in a sensational philosophy, because it is not a universal experience. It will become so. The further revelations of the Lord all contributed to create the conviction, and Pentecost sealed it to the world. It is desirable to remember (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/24-33.htm">Luke 24:33</a>, etc.) that not merely the eleven apostles received this Divine gift but all the others who had gathered together with them. This circumstance must be held to govern to some extent the solemn and mysterious privilege which appears to follow the Divine bestowment of the Holy Spirit. We cannot divide the company into two parts, one of which received the Holy Spirit, and the other which did not receive him; one of which became conscious of the Divine reality, and the other not. The women who had been the first witnesses and proclaimers of the resurrection-life of the Lord could not have been deprived of this sublime privilege. To the little society of believers, before long to swell to a company of a hundred and twenty, was this great grace given, and to the new fellowship of faith was the high privilege vouchsafed; for he continued, <span class="cmt_word">Whosesoever sins ye</span> (remit) <span class="cmt_word">forgive, they are forgiven</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them</span> - absolutely forgiven by God; for who can forgive sins but God only, and the Son of man who had and exercised the power on earth to forgive sins?  - <span class="cmt_word">and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained</span>. The history of the interpretation of this remarkable passage is given at length in Herzog's 'Real Encycl.,' art. "Schl&uuml;sselgewelt," by Stein. The patristic, scholastic, Tridentine,' Reformation doctrines are very carefully treated. The decrees of the Council of Trent, session 16. co. 1. - 6, show that every form in which apostolic custom, reformed theology, and modern exegesis have solved the problem of their meaning, was repudiated and anathematized by the Church of Rome, and that the function of forgiving or retaining sin was reserved for the priesthood alone, whether in respect of venial or mortal sin (see ' Ecclesia: Church Problems considered in a Series of Essays,' article by the present writer "On Forgiveness and Absolution of Sins"). It is impossible to sever this passage from those passages in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a> where Peter's confession of the Messiahship draws forth from the Lord the extraordinary benediction and privilege, "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." Lightfoot and Sch&ouml;ttgen have shown, by numerous quotations from the Talmud, that the phrases "bind" and "loose" are repeatedly used by the rabbis to denote the declaration of what is binding and what is immaterial in ethic and religions life. Thus say they, "The school of Hillel binds, the school of Schammai looses or declares indifferent, this or that regulation." We know that it was given to Peter, by the conference upon him of the powers of the Holy Ghost, to declare the terms of admission and exclusion from the kingdom of God. Thus <a href="../../par/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37-39</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20-24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-48</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-8.htm">Acts 15:8</a>, etc. Now, we find James in the same assembly proceeding still further than Simon Peter (James, who was not even one of the twelve disciples); and Paul repeatedly, in the Acts and in his Epistles, declaring by Divine inspiration the duties, the privileges, the ideas, the redeeming principles, of the kingdom of God, "binding and loosing," in the full confidence that he was the minister and mouthpiece of Jesus Christ. This is not remarkable, because we find that the identical privilege which was in <a href="../../par/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16</a>. described as a privilege of Peter is in <a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-19</a> conferred, not merely on Peter, but on the whole Church, and still more explicitly upon any two who should agree as touching the forgiveness of a brother, to ask the Father in heaven for this great boon. This privilege is based on the ground that "where two or three are gathered together" in Christ's Name, there, says he, "am I in the midst of them." If the offending brother had refused all repentance and neglected to hear the judgment of the Church, this prayer cannot be urged. Peter then seeks for further information, "How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?" In answer to this question Christ reminded Peter of the Father's boundless love, and made it the pattern of human forgiveness; and the whole question of the forgiveness of injuries is shown to be closely associated with this binding and loosing power, this anticipation, this discovery of the will of the Father, this acquisition of the truth in answer to earnest prayer. Prayer is, as we have seen in numberless places, the rising up of human desires into the very purposes and grace of God, not a change wrought by us in the mind and will of God - God forbid that we should ever, to our confusion, secure such a result as that! - but it is in essence a change wrought by God in us, helping us to say, "Thy will be done!" Let it be borne m mind that this privilege of learning and uttering in our prayers the forgiving love of God, upon the conditions of repentance and faith and a forgiving spirit, is not confined to Peter, but conferred on all the disciples, nay, upon any two of them who should agree to pray with the sinning brother for forgiveness. This great law of love, prayer, and forgiveness was doubtless given for all time. Our Lord, in this repetition of a promise made on an earlier occasion, emits all reference to the binding in heaven of what is bound on earth. Yet he does not repeal the promise, but rather specifies the occasions on which the disciples would find that most frequently they would have to exercise it. Whosesoever sins ye, etc. It is as much as to say - Announce boldly remission of sins on conditions of faith and repentance (<a href="../../par/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>) "to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." Your forgiveness even of my murderers, your forgiveness of' Samaritans and publicans, of chief priests and Pharisees, of Greeks and Jews, of those that stone you and persecute you; as well as your announcement of the infinite compassion of God, shall be justified and ratified in heaven. This has been the divinest function of the Church and of the disciples of Christ ever since. There is no case that we can find in the New Testament in which the apostles as an order of men, or the ministers of the Church as such, assumed in any other way the power of personally forgiving, in the stead of God, the specific sins of any individuals. We cannot here trace the matter into the controversies that have arisen as to the power of a specially ordered ministry to absolve personally individual sinners from the consequences of their sin against God. Spiritual communion with Christ, personal reception from Christ himself of his own Spirit, is the highest guarantee of power to proclaim with emancipating effect the amnesty of love, or to utter with subduing might the terrors of the Lord.

It is peculiar to John's narrative, and throws light upon the very construction of the Gospel. It reveals the characteristics of honest doubt, and indicates the abundance of the evidence which was offered to specific classes and conditions of mind to help them believe that the Lord had risen. The confession drawn from the heart of this apostle is not only valuable in itself, but it reflects a new luster on the previous manifestation. Moreover, it is cumulative in its argumentative force. The most skeptical is the most enthusiastic of the twelve. <span class="cmt_word">But Thomas, one of the twelve</span> (a term of designation for the first group of the apostles, and one which was not renounced, although two of them were absent. The number "twelve" had a symbolic and historic value from its relation to the twelve tribes, and we find (<a href="../../par/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>.) that the eleven were anxious to fill up the vacant place left by Judas), <span class="cmt_word">called Didymus</span> (Greek for "twin," repeated here from <a href="../../par/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>, not simply to imply that Thomas was best known by his Greek name, but that there was a blending in him of intense love and a fear which had torment, a great ambition and yet exposure to moods of despondency, a desire to treat the whole manifestation of Christ as complete, to believe that the words of the Lord were all sublimely true, - coupled with a ghastly doubt that all was a delusion, a faculty of constructive faith and speculation, of transcendental intuition side by side with an intense desire for sensible manifestation, a greater belief in the Master than in the disciples, but no unwillingness to accept that which was sufficiently established). <span class="cmt_word">Thomas was not with them when Jesus came.</span> We can never know why he was absent. He was given to moody fear, and shrank into solitude; and doubtless in many ways and words, as well as those recorded, had implied the wreck of his hopes. Separated from the fellowship of kindred spirits, he augmented his gloom; he was fast tending to unbelief. The state of his mind throughout the Passover week may have been one reason why the apostles delayed their return to Galilee. They may have come frequently to him with their sublime announcement, not once nor twice only.

If Themas could grasp the new life, the new and hitherto unrevealed order of being, if he could spiritually see the realization of all the mystery of love in the Resurrection, then all that he was doubting would flash forth at once from its hiding-place. Perhaps, if he had been present with the rest, he would have accepted it; but how can he "believe through their word"? The extent of his doubt is further seen in this: he did not say, "If I see the print of the nails... I will believe;" but, "Except I see... I will by no means believe." The first manifestation of our Lord seemed to correspond with the first portion of the Savior's high-priestly prayer, viz. that he might himself be glorified; the second manifestation of the day corresponded with the prayer for the disciples; and now the third manifestation is to meet the difficulties of the third and more numerous class, who must gather all their conviction from the evidence of others. This subtle relation between parts of the Gospel shows how profound is the principle of its construction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-26.htm">John 20:26</a></div><div class="verse">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: <i>then</i> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after eight days</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the Passover week was over, during which the disciples were pondering the new revelations of the Easter Day, and becoming more able to understand the meaning of a spiritual presence - to understand what the real "touching" of the risen Lord meant - <span class="cmt_word">again his disciples were within</span> the same or a similar abode referred to in ver. 19. Some have urged that this manifestation occurred in Galilee, whither the disciples had been directed to journey to receive the most convincing proofs of his power and presence. There is no evidence of this at all, and the form of expression corresponds so closely with the description of the conditions of the first meeting, that we cannot accept the suggestion of Olshausen and others. Some have urged that this is the beginning of the celebration of the Resurrection-day - the sanctification of the first day of the week. Such a conclusion cannot be positively asserted. "Eight days" having fully elapsed might bring them to the evening of the second day of the second week. The expression, "seven days," is unquestionably used for a week in the Old Testament, though Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>) seems to use the expression, "about eight days," for a well-known division of time, probably "from sabbath to sabbath;" and from the Jewish way of reckoning the beginning of a day on the sunset of the preceding day, we might reckon that, from the middle of the first Sunday to the evening of the second, the period would include parts of eight days. There is nothing, therefore, to prevent the calculation of parts of eight days from the great events of Easter Day as a whole to the evening of the second Sunday. And though, as Meyer says, there is nothing indicative of any consecration of the first day of the week, it is obviously calculated to explain the custom which so rapidly sprang up in the Christian community. Nor is it without interest that John, in the Apocalypse, described himself as receiving his first great vision on "the Lord's day." <span class="cmt_word">And Thomas was with them</span>. He had not broken with the disciples, even if he could not accept their unanimous testimony. He was now, at least, sharing their excitement, and perhaps their hope, and many in addition to the eleven disciples were striving to realize with them the new condition of things, even their common relation to an invisible and triumphant Lord. The Gospel of Matthew and the undisputed portion of <a href="../../par/mark/16.htm">Mark 16</a>. describe no appearance to the apostles in Jerusalem, and consequently the opponents of the Fourth Gospel have commented on the apostles' cowardly flight from Jerusalem, and on the unhistoric character of the two appearances to them in the metropolis. The fact is that there is no indication of flight in the synoptists, and the Fourth Gospel throws light on the return to Galilee in <a href="../../par/john/21.htm">John 21</a>. (see Weiss, 'Life of Jesus,' vol. 3:403, 404). Matthew gives rather a summary of the appearances of forty days (<a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), in an event to which probably St. Paul refers (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When the doors had been shut</span> (observe here and in ver. 19 the perfect passive participle), <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cometh, and stood in the midst, and said</span> (once more, as he saw their natural perturbation; for do not men always shrink from manifestation of pure spirit or spiritual body?), <span class="cmt_word">Peace be unto you</span> (see notes on vers. 19, 20). The repetition of the appearance at a similar hour and place confirmed and intensified their previous experience. If doubts had crept into any minds, the rectification of the first impression would be secured, and a Divine joy once more surcharge their minds. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <i>it</i> into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>; delude, Vulgate; darnach, Luther) <span class="cmt_word">saith he to Thomas,</span> as though he had read his heart and sounded the depth of his complicated conflict between hope and fear, despair and love, and moreover intimating the fact that he had heard his disciple's protestations, as well as mercifully appreciated his genuine difficulties, and not unnatural hesitation, <span class="cmt_word">Reach hither thy finger, that organ with which thou wouldest test the reality of my being.</span> Do what thou wilt. <span class="cmt_word">See! my hands</span>; and as the word was spoken he spread before his doubting, loving disciple those hands which were nailed to the cursed tree, with all the signs of his great agony upon them still. Thomas had said that he must "see," and that he must touch - "lay his finger in the print of the nails." Here was the Divine opportunity for him, with more than one sense, to assure himself of the reality. <span class="cmt_word">And reach hither thy hand</span> (again the Lord quoted the very words in which the incredulousness of Thomas had been expressed), and put it into my side. He says nothing of the print of the nails, but offers the sacred privilege to the doubtful disciple. Thomas shall have the precise evidence he craved. The most hesitating of the entire group shall have the aid to his faith which he fancied indispensable in his particular case. How often has the unbeliever said, "If such or such evidence be not granted to me, I cannot, I will not, I by no means will believe"! Thus Gideon proved the Lord's willingness to utilize his feeble strength in delivering Israel from the Midianites; and even Ahaz was summoned by Isaiah to choose any sign whatsoever in heaven above or in the earth to prove the indestructible vitality of the true seed of Israel and real house of David. Consequently, we cannot say with Bengel, "Si Pharisseus its dixisset, 'nisi videro, etc.,' nil impetrasset sed discipulo pridem probato nil non datur." The Lord does sometimes offer exactly what we ask by way of proof; but we cannot know the precise effect it will produce, even when it is bestowed or when something still more explicit is actually provided for our weakness. Just as the cruel taunts which malice heaped or hurled on the name and work of our Divine Lord became wreaths of glory for his brow, so the cruel wounds which unbelief and bigoted hatred of goodness had inflicted on Immanuel became from that very hour the high, main, indelible evidence of his supreme victory. <span class="cmt_word">And become not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) what thou art in danger of becoming - the Lord does not say that Thomas's - <span class="cmt_word">faithless</span>, but that he runs the risk of ultimately becoming so through the dependence of his spirit upon the outward (so Meyer, Lange, Westcott, etc.); but be believing, faithful. It is impossible fully to express the play upon these two words. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not so much a worthless, untrustworthy person, as one who has settled down into an abiding condition of unbelief; and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not simply" believing," but" trustworthy," "trusty," and "trustful."

Before, so far as we know, any gesture or effort was made on his part to accept the tests which had been so rashly demanded, but so graciously offered. He already found evidence which was far more efficacious than that which he in gross and sensuous fashion had thought indispensable for his peculiarly constituted mind. Before doing more than fill his hungry eyes with these identifying signs of the Lord's actual objective presence, he did in reality touch his Lord by other powers than finger or hand. He bounded from the depths of despondency to the very top of faith, and he "answered"  - he responded to the proof he had already received of the Lord's triumph over death, and to the seal that had now been set upon the Lord's own supreme and majestic claims, by an adoring cry. Thomas "said to him." Observe it is not hinted that he uttered a vague and ejaculatory cry to the eternal Father (as Theodore of Mopsuestia, modern rationalists and Unitarians have repeatedly urged - a speculation which is wrecked on the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God</span>. This is the first time that any of the disciples had ever drawn this lofty conclusion of love and reason. They had called him "the Son of God," "the Lord," as a Being of quite immeasurable claims; and John, in the prologue, after years of meditation, declared that "the Logos which was God" and "with God," and the Creator of all things, and "the Light and Life," had "become flesh," and flashed forth" the glory of the only begotten Son," even in his earthly life; but it was reserved for the most depressed and skeptical mind of them all, the honest doubter, the man who needed immediate and irresistible evidence, infallible proofs, triumphant, invincible demonstrations - it was reserved for Thomas to say TO HIM, and to say unrebuked, uncondemned, by the risen Lord," MY LORD AND MY GOD!" Herein is condensed into one burning utterance from the worried heart of humanity the slowly gathering conclusion which had been steadily inwrought in the mind of his disciples by all the teachings of the Savior. It was at last spontaneous and exultant. These words are the climax of the entire Gospel. Every narrative points on to this unchallenged utterance. From the wedding at Cana to the raising of Lazarus, from the testimony of the Baptist to the awful tones of intercessory prayer, every discourse, every miracle, points on to this superlative conclusion, not breathed in loving accents by the enthusiastic Mary, not sounded forth by the rock-like apostle, not whispered in awestruck affection by the beloved disciple, but wrung from the broken heart of the man who had said, "Let us go, that we may die with him;" of him who cried, "We know not whither thou goest: how can we know the way?" of him who had said, "Unless I see the print of the nails, I will not believe." It is not long before it is notorious that St. Paul spoke of him as "God blessed forever," called him the" Image of the invisible God," as endowed with "the Name that is above every name," as "set down on the right hand of the majesty on high;" that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews called him the "express Image of the Father's substance," and "the Effulgence of the Father's glory." The earliest testimonies of heathendom confess that Christians sang hymns to Christ as to God (Pliny, 'Letter to Trajan')! but this was the hour of the great confession; this was the birth-cry of Christendom; this was the epoch-making scene, which guided the pen of John from the prologue to the close of the Gospel Thus Thomas doubted that the Church might believe. Thomas did indeed die with his Master, that he might lead a multitude of the dead from their hopelessness and unrest to the resurrection-life. He received a full and all-sufficing evidence of the supernatural and Divine life, and eighteen hundred years of faith have blessed God for the victory which Thomas gained over his despondency, and for the climacteric force with which St. John tells us of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <i>are</i> they that have not seen, and <i>yet</i> have believed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed.</span> Our Lord does not bid him rise, nor say, as the angel did to John in the Apocalypse, "Worship God;" nor did he reject the homage which is here so grandly paid; but he describes this very state of mind which induced the disciple to say, "My Lord and my God!" as that high, holy acquisition which throughout his ministry he had treated as the main, prime condition of all spiritual blessings. "Thou hast believed," said he, "and because thou hast seen me; thou hast become a believer in all that I am, because thou hast received this crowning proof of the reality of my victory over death." There are critics or scholars (Lachmann, Meyer, Ewald, etc.), who treat the expression as an interrogative: <span class="accented">Because thou hast seen me, hast thou believed</span> (<span class="accented">art thou now a believing man</span>?); and the Revisers have placed this punctuation in their margin. A few cursives thus point the words, but it is improbable, for it would seem, even still, to have suggested a doubt or question in the mind of the Lord touching the reality of the apostle's faith. Moreover, the obvious contrast between those who have seen and those who saw not would be obscured by the punctuation. Observe that Christ did not say, "Because thou hast touched me, thou hast believed." The vision alone brought the apostle back to that high tension of faith which he, with others, had reached on the night of the Passion (see <a href="../../par/john/16-30.htm">John 16:30-32</a>, and notes). All the tide of overmastering love surged up within him. But the condition of multitudes was even then less privileged than that of Thomas. It could not be a part of the conduct of the kingdom of God that each separate soul should have all the elements of conviction which the apostles had enjoyed, all the vision and all the inspiration of the chosen prophets of the Lord. There may and will come a time when "every eye shall see him" as Thomas saw him, when all shall have the function and powers, equal faculties and opportunity, of seeing him. In the Apocalypse the evangelist, at the very commencement of his visions, saw for himself all the mystery and the certainty of this crowning victory. Meanwhile faith upon testimony, faith in reality through the power of truth, is declared to be the law of the kingdom, and the great beatitude which Christ left as his latest legacy is, <span class="cmt_word">Blessed</span> (<span class="cmt_word">are</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they who saw not, and believed</span>. Of whom is he speaking? Clearly not of those who had already received the same advantage which Thomas had now enjoyed so tardily! The apostles, at first, did not accept the testimony of the women, nor the voices and messages o angels, nor the objective fact of the deserted grave. John rebuked himself for not knowing that the Christ must rise from the dead, whether he should have personal ocular evidence of it or not; and he blamed himself for not believing throughout the earthly ministry of Christ that "the Holy One could not see corruption." Still, the fact was patent, that not until the disciples saw the Lord were they glad. Even in their gladness there was the mingling of surprise and incredulousness. To whom, then, did the blessedness apply? Surely, first of all to the multitudes of loving, waiting souls, who were prepared by their reverence and the new life given to them, and by the bewildering rumors of the Easter week, to believe in the Divine necessity of the Resurrection. Christ told the disciples, on their way to Emmaus, that they were foolish and dull of heart in not accepting all that the prophets had spoken. Before the final assurance given by their identification of his Person, he persuaded them to accept his statements, and believe in all that he was, including the fact of his resurrection. Whether they should ever have more convincing evidence or not, they were bound to believe that the suffering Messiah was, in the very nature of things, and by Divine necessity, Victor of death, and must see the travail of his soul. This does but repeat the same idea, ,' Blessed are they who saw not as Thomas and the other disciples were at this moment doing, and yet believed." But the beatitude includes the whole future of the Church. "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory." So said St. Peter to the widely scattered Church. The Lord does not sever the link between external facts and spiritual principles, and thus propound a group of subjective conceptions for a series of objective realities (as Baur and others have urged); but he does pronounce a great benediction on those who can rise to faith in himself through the word which he has spoken, and which his apostles would continue to proclaim without intervention of physical contact or visible manifestation. "If Christ be not risen, then is your faith vain; ye are yet in your sins." These words are charged with the grounds of conviction for others. Instead of the first disciples being disposed to transform hallucinations of spiritual manifestation into tangible and visible objective facts, they appear to have been more prone and tempted to transform some utterly indisputable facts into spiritual phenomena. There were objective facts, but every attempt which has been made to discredit the Resurrection while admitting these facts has utterly broken down. Even if the narratives of the four Gospels, with their divergent representation, be left out of sight, nothing can be more certain than that, in the space of a quarter of a century, the Churches of Christ in Antioch, Corinth, Philippi, Rome, Ephesus, and Ancyra were existing, and held, without doubt or question, the objective fact. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-11</a>) simply recounts, not for the first time, but as a resume of long-since-delivered instruction, the indubitable fact of the Resurrection. It was not an incredible thing, even to Agrippa, that God should raise the dead; nor need it be so now to any one who accepts as true Christ's account of the Father. The creation of the Church unquestionably turns on the settled conviction of the first disciples that Jesus rose from the dead. That conviction cannot be accounted for independently of the fact. Every attempt to explain it apart from the fact itself has hitherto been wrecked.

Controversy has prevailed from the days of Chrysostom to our own, as to whether these verses are the summary and conclusion of the Gospel as a whole, or have special reference to the record only of the appearances of Jesus after his resurrection. It cannot be doubted that as St. John sums up in <a href="../../par/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. the general teaching of Christ and its effect upon the people, to the termination of his public ministry, so at the close of this chapter, before recording the special bearing of the resurrection-life and spiritual power of Christ on the subsequent condition of the Church  - a narrative of peculiar interest in itself, corresponding with the prologue of the entire narrative - he gathers up the general significance of his Gospel and its relation to other books. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many other signs therefore did Jesus also in the presence of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples, which are not written in this book</span>. The "many" and "other" refer to those signs with which his readers may be familiar from other sources, and, as it seems to us, in other (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) books. We have seen throughout how thoroughly alive the evangelist is to the minutest details of the synoptic narrative. The word "many" seems most accurately to include more than the few appearances after his resurrection which are not mentioned by John, but which are recorded by the synoptists, and the "other" refers most probably to signs of a different class from those which he has selected. The "signs" written in this book are those central facts which formed the theme and starting-points of his discourses. "Signs" do not necessarily mean miraculous works (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>), but all "indications" or "tokens" of his higher nature and Divine commission, such as his appearance in the synagogue of Nazareth; the cleansing of the temple, which had so powerfully affected the mind of Nicodemus; the repeated assertion of his pre-existence and eternal glory; the feeling of the officers of the Sanhedrin, that "never man spake like this Man;" the effect produced by his lofty claims to be "Lord of the sabbath" and "greater than the temple;" the arrogation of power to forgive sins; the discomfiture of the deputation from chief priests and elders; the collapse of the Roman soldiers; and all other proofs of his supreme authority. All these <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> were not indispensably connected with corresponding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> "Before the disciples" suggests a special limitation and condition which took powerful hold upon the mind of the evangelist. We hear in one passage that "he could do no mighty works, because of their unbelief." To prepared minds he came with his spiritual revelations and special suggestions of heavenly origin. John sees the memories passing before him, which have already formed the heritage of the Church, and is reminded of "many ethers" which have never found a chronicler. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a></div><div class="verse">But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, says he, <span class="cmt_word">these are written</span> with a special purpose. The author did not intend to write a full history or a detailed biography; he avowed having made a unique and well-considered selection of "signs," which formed the theme of great discourse, of "words" which revealed the inner depths of that wondrous nature, and which, far from exhausting the theme, only touched its fringes; and he did this with a distinct aim, <span class="cmt_word">in order that ye</span> (he here addresses the Churches already founded and waiting for his legacy) <span class="cmt_word">might believe</span>.

The prologue here finds its true and efficient complement. The purpose now betrayed expounds the structure of the Gospel as a whole. The apostle claims kinship with the central apostolate. The Hebrew prophet does not disdain his true kindred. The evangelist does not disclaim his predecessors. The lover of souls discloses his lofty passion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 19"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 21"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/21.htm"><title>John 21 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/21.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/21.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/21-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/20.htm" title="John 20">&#9668;</a> John 21 <a href="../acts/1.htm" title="Acts 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a></div><div class="verse">After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <i>himself</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias</span>. The opening formula is one often adopted by John (see particularly <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>); considerable periods of time and cycles of ministry are frequently covered by it. Another chapter is opened, another series of events to be recorded which had left undying impression on the apostle's mind, and, in full view of numerous other traditions, was chosen by himself as especially worthy of record. "Jesus manifested himself." In <a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a> we hear that "he manifested his glory;" now he manifested his Person, as an act of his own will. He was "manifested in the flesh" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>), but now that flesh was itself more directly under the control of his personality, and the mere sensuous eye and carnal understanding could not without his special permission realize that wondrous presence. The passive form of the verb is used in <a href="../../par/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12, 14</a>. The touch of feeling involved in the active voice must not be overlooked. The "again" clearly points back to the previous manifestations described in <a href="../../par/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14, 19, 26</a>. On each occasion his coming, though in a recognizable human body, was a body (a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, not a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which had the qualities of spirit. "The disciples" are afterwards mentioned by name. It was to disciples only that he "appeared." Believers in him were those alone who could see this spiritual body. The effect produced upon them was that of objective reality, but this was made to prepared spirits. Such a proceeding is akin to all the grander operations of nature, and the most august manifestations of God. "At the sea of Tiberias." This is the only place where the "sea of Galilee," or of "Gennesareth," is called the "sea of Tiberias." That it was identical with the familiar lake is evident from the known site of Tiberias (now represented by the modern town Tubarieh), a city which is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02.3; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:09. 1; 'Vit.,' &sect;&sect; 12, 13, 64), and which, from its schools of learned men, had a great place in later Jewish history. Moreover, in <a href="../../par/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1, 23</a>, if the Greek be accurately rendered, the writer spoke of "the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias," interpreting the name well known by the Jews, through another name by which it would be better recognized by Gentiles (see note on John 6:1). Dr. Farrar, 'Message of the Books,' sees in the nomenclature a hint of the later origin of the Fourth Gospel than the date assigned to the synoptic narrative. 'Er; is used because the shore where they saw him was a raised beach or cliff" above" the sea. It must be observed that the same phrase is used in <a href="../../par/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a> for Christ's walking "upon the sea;" but the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is itself explained here by the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 4, just as the preposition receives elsewhere more literally another meaning from the context. <span class="cmt_word">And he manifested himself thus</span>; "on this wise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the manner to be described. This is the commencement of our Lord's discourses on the kingdom of God (<a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>). This was the beginning of the great fulfillment of his own predictions (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>), and of the angel's words to the women. The narrative gives the deep heart-tones and genuine teaching of the risen Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were together</span>. Not the whole company of the eleven apostles; five are especially mentioned, and two are left unnamed. The five, of whom the Gospel knows much, are <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter</span>, whose twofold name denotes that, notwithstanding his grievous failure, he had not lost his faith, and still stood at the head of the company, the man of rock and the man of impetuous energy. <span class="cmt_word">Thomas called Didymus</span>, whose incredulity had vanished, and whose devoted love had emerged from the depths of despondency to the loftiest faith, who had come to feel and say that the risen Christ was both Lord and God. Thomas, who had shrunk from the society of his fellow-apostles, was now closely united with them, more than he had ever previously seemed to have been. Thomas is the apostle last mentioned by the evangelist. Elsewhere he is associated with Philip of Bethsaida, and this town may have been his home. <span class="cmt_word">Nathanael of Cana in Galilee</span> is mentioned by way of recalling the two miracles recorded by John as having taken place in this "Cana of Galilee" (<a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-16.htm">John 4:16</a>). The former of the miracles followed immediately on the mention of the calling of Nathanael (<a href="../../par/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>). The reference to the little place in Galilee where the glory of Christ had been first of all seen and had led to the faith of the disciples, calls attention to the place and province of this manifestation, and to what was contained in the memory of one of the witnesses. And <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (<span class="cmt_word">sons</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of Zebedee</span> - a phrase used for James and John in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>. This is the only time that Zebedee is mentioned in this Gospel; but the reason for his sons being thus designated points unmistakably to the first call of these two men to discipleship by the side of this very lake, after they had witnessed the draught of fishes, becoming from that time forward "fishers of men" (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). That they should here be mentioned after Thomas and after Nathanael corresponds with the reticence and modesty of the evangelist. This is still more probable if the <span class="cmt_word">two other disciples</span> were <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> in the broader sense. The simple fact that they are mentioned after the five apostles has been thought by some to imply that, whosoever these were, they were not of the number of the eleven. No one writing the story in the second century would, in an enumeration like this, have placed the proto-martyr James and the intimate friend of Peter, the great "light of Asia," the admitted author of the Apocalypse, and the spiritual father of Polycarp and Papias, after Thomas and Nathanael. After his manner, he (the author) here prepared for the implicit subsequent identification of the "disciple whom Jesus loved," and also the author of the Gospel, with one of the sons of Zebedee. The supposition that Andrew and Philip are meant by the "two other disciples" is not without verisimilitude, from their mention in <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. If this were the case, both of them are practically discriminated from the "disciple whom Jesus loved" by the obvious references to them elsewhere by name, while "John" never thus signalizes himself. The mention of seven disciples reveals the love of the writer for the number "seven," with its division into two groups of three and four (see Introduction, pp. 78, 79.). And it is remarkable that, if Andrew and Philip are the unnamed ones, the seven would correspond with the first seven apostles mentioned in Matthew's enumeration (Matthew 10:2-4). Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Judas the brother of James, or Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot were not present. This, of course, rests on the hypothesis that Nathanael and Bartholomew are identical (<a href="../../par/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-3.htm">John 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a-fishing</span>. The abruptness of the language addressed to six (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) disciples, who seemed to be living as in one family, suggests a lengthened waiting, and some disappointment as to the effect upon their daily life of the great revelation. They are summoned by the most commanding spirit among them to resume what was, for some of them at least, their customary calling. He would seek in humble fashion, along the lines of ordinary duty to his family and himself, the supply of daily wants. According to some writers, Peter felt a presentiment of the coming of his Lord under scenes identical with those of his first call (<a href="../../par/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>). According to others, Peter exhibited some of the heart-sickness of deferred hope. On either supposition we see a new illustration of, and testimony to, the character of the man who was so conspicuous an initiator. <span class="cmt_word">They say to him, We also come</span> (or, go) <span class="cmt_word">with thee.</span> They do not "follow" him, as they had been summoned once to follow their Lord; but they are willing, even eager, to accompany the strong-hearted man, and ready to take his lead. They share at once either in his presentiment or in the expression of his delayed hope. <span class="cmt_word">They went forth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the home which they had made for themselves on this well-remembered spot - from Capernaum, which was most probably the early home of Peter, and a spot to which he would naturally revert. <span class="cmt_word">And entered into the ship</span>; the veritable vessel that had often served them on that lake of storms. Though Peter and Andrew, James and John, had left their boats and nets and hired servants, it is not unlikely that members of their two families had retained them. <span class="cmt_word">And that night they took nothing</span>.

Some critics have supposed this failure to be parabolic or symbolic of the comparatively barren results of the apostolic ministry to the Jews, while what followed was prophetic of the great success which should accompany their appeal to the Gentiles. But Peter's wonderful success on the Day of Pentecost and on subsequent occasions in dealing with Jews, contradicts this interpretation. The only analogy which offers itself to our minds is the limited success of all their endeavors until the apostles were veritably endowed with power from on high.

The morning mist and shadows adding to the obscurity produced by some hundred yards of distance, together with wearied and toilsome effort and a sleepless night, may suggest some explanation of the marvel; but the mystery is baffling. Two or three remarks may be made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> These various appearances seem at first to confuse their perceptions by reason of the ordinary human characteristics that accompanied them. Mary for a moment mistook him for the owner or worker in the garden; the "two disciples" imagined that he was "a stranger in Jerusalem;" and these disciples think him, for the moment, to have been a stray wanderer by the lake-side. Their presupposition concerning the reappearance of their risen Lord would probably have involved some strange and awe-striking fulguration of his power; but the true "spiritual body" does, when it pleases, take on forms far more familiar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The slowness of the process by which the apostles became finally convinced, against their prejudices and sense-bound views, that he had risen into a new form of living, and into new conditions of existence.

The miracle here is a simple indication of the higher knowledge which the Lord possessed. This huge shoal may, humanly speaking, have been perceived in its approach; so that the event is more impressive in its analogical force than in its supernatural machinery. It suggests the surprising results that would accompany their labor when they should under the Lord's own injunction and inspiration, become veritable fishers of men.

Had he not again and again done wondrous things of power, wisdom, and love on this very spot, in these very waters? So John comes intuitively and with true insight to the sacred truth and reality, and his conduct is again contrasted wonderfully with the energetic and impulsive Peter (<a href="../../par/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 6</a>). The same relative characteristics of the two apostles have been preserved throughout the fivefold narrative. Such a contrast so delicately and persistently sustained lends certainty to the objective reality. <span class="cmt_word">Accordingly Simon Peter, when he heard, It is the Lord</span> - for the words flashed conviction into him - hurried at once to put his new idea to practical proof.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> does not mean perfectly nude. A man who had simply the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> or tunic upon him was practically thus regarded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> in the same sense.

Dr. Salmond truly says that this reference to an act which to ordinary men would have suggested a different arrangement of dress, reveals the eye-witness. Hengstenberg suggests that Peter simply girded his upper garment for the purpose of swimming more easily; but, as Luthardt observes, with this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> already upon him, he would not have been "naked" <span class="cmt_word">And he cast himself into the sea</span>, intending, whatever might be the fate of the laden net, to be the first to greet and worship the Lord. Of the reception he met with John says nothing: he knew nothing. The Lord had some special instruction for him a little later. It is not in harmony with the words, as Gerhard supposed, that Peter walked triumphantly upon the waters. Not a hint of it occurs. The hundred yards were rapidly covered, either by swimming or wading to the shore meanwhile. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-8.htm">John 21:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the other disciples came in the little boat</span>.

The reason why the other disciples came in the boat is given in the parenthesis: (<span class="cmt_word">for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits off</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about three hundred feet, half a stadium, a hundred yards. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> to denote distance from, is used in this Gospel (see note, <a href="../../par/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a>) and the Revelation (Revelation 14:20). The disciples came in the boat over this distance, <span class="cmt_word">dragging the net (full) of fishes.</span> The net was not broken, though filled. They did not further attempt to lift it; they hauled it to the shore as it was. Strauss, who tries to show that we have a glorifying myth framed out of an amalgam of the narratives of the first miraculous draught and that of Peter walking on the water, is singularly unfortunate; for there is less of the supernatural in the story than in either of the two narratives to which he refers.

Observe the form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (of <a href="../../par/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>), which implies that the burning brazier was placed there for a purpose. <span class="cmt_word">And fish laid thereon, and a loaf</span>.

Our Lord was regarding the whole of this proceeding from the standing of one who would meet their hunger, and was conscious of power to feed the world in its utmost need. So the provision which was thus made in advance for the need of the disciples becomes symbolic of Christ's power to meet all the wants of the dying world. Numerous speculations have been hazarded about the method employed by our Lord to prepare this meal. The early Fathers, Chrysostom, Theophylact, with Grotius, have appealed  to Christ's creative power. Luthardt thinks of the ministry of angels. Some have suggested that Peter prepared the hasty repast during the interval that elapsed between his landing on the shore and the approach of the boat. Our Lord, who knew how to arrange for the last supper with his disciples, and who had all the resources of Providence, and hosts of disciples along the shore, would, with superlative ease, and without revealing himself to strangers, have made this simple meal; and, with his knowledge of the ease, would have still delighted to act towards his beloved ones as at once their Host and their Minister. He simply prepared for his own what he has been doing ever since. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-10.htm">John 21:10</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">which ye have now taken</span> (see note on ver. 3). It is not exactly said what was done with this fish. The implication is that to the scanty meal already provided, the new supply was added, and that the Lord permitted his disciples to join his repast, and to rejoice with him at the success of their labor. They and he shared in the travail, and were satisfied therewith. The circumstance is highly parabolic of the common joy which would fill his heart and theirs when the fullness of the Gentiles should be brought in, and all Israel be saved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-11.htm">John 21:11</a></div><div class="verse">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Simon Peter went up</span>. Here again Simon is first in action, as John is the more rapid and real in his mental processes. The other disciples may have aided him, following his lead; but the singular verbs are used on both occasions (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). In like manner, though the twelve apostles took part in the transactions of Pentecost, Peter opened his mouth to speak. On other occasions, while John spake by the eloquent glances of his eye, and the rest of the disciples joined their leader in testimony and prayer, Peter's voice was that which conveyed the mighty exultation of their common heart (<a href="../../par/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, etc.; Acts 4:8, etc.; Acts 8:20, etc.; Acts 10:34-11:30; 15:7-11). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>, "went up," must be explained by the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used of embarking in a vessel (<a href="../../par/john/21-3.htm">John 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-51.htm">Mark 6:51</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-6.htm">Acts 21:6</a>), though in each case there is some difference in the manuscripts, with reference to the text, as there is also here. If the vessel was drawn up on the shore, with the net attached to it, the form of expression is explicable. Peter went up into the boat for the lines of the net, and, having secured it, <span class="cmt_word">he drew the net to the land</span>, <span class="cmt_word">full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three.</span> Various efforts have been made from early times to give some symbolic meaning to this enumeration. Canon Westcott has detailed several of these strange guesses. Cyril of Alexandria set the example, and was followed by Ammonius the presbyter, who both in different ways regarded the 3 as representative of the Trinity, the 100 + 50 representing, in different proportions, the success of the apostolic ministry among Gentiles and Jews. Augustine observes that 10 is the number of the Law, and 7 the number of the Spirit, 10 + 7   =   17; and the numbers from 1 + 2 + 3 + 17   =   153; so that the number represents all who are brought to God under every dispensation of grace. Gregory the Great reaches the value 17 in the same fashion as Augustine, but, says he, it is only by faith in the Trinity that either Jew or Gentile ever reaches the fullness of salvation; 17 is therefore multiplied by 3   =   3 x 17, which produces 51, which is the number of true rest; multiplied again by 3, which completes the glory of the perfected, it is 153. Hengstenberg, following Grotius, supposes a reference to the 153,600 Canaanitish proselytes who were received into the kingdom in Solomon's day (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>)! though the odd 600 certainly confuse the reckoning. Jerome refers to the opinion of a learned naturalist of the second century, Oppian, who is said to have ascertained that there were 153 different kinds of fish in the seas, and that the apostles took of every kind, revealing the ultimate success of the fishers of souls with every kind of man - an allegory based on false science and insecure data, and involving a stupendous miracle, if it be meant for an historical fact. Several of the modern T&uuml;bingen school, in various but unsatisfactory ways, see in the number one made up by the letters composing the name of Simeon (71) bar (22) Jonah (31) Kephas (29); and here even Keim follows suit. Thoma finds the number in the mystic <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3a7;&#x398;&#x3a5;&#x3a3;</span>, "Jesus Christ the Son of God, Savior." Reuss discourages mystical or occult meaning. The remark of Baumgarten-Crusius, that the number is simply an index of the authenticity of the narrative, and of the fact that the fishes were counted on the occasion, is eminently sensible (so Godet and Meyer). The fact that it is not a round number adds to the probability of this statement, and enters a caveat against allegorical interpretation. And for all they were so many, the net was not rent. This is obviously a point of contrast with the first miraculous draught of fishes, when the nets brake and the boats began to sink. This does form a probable allegory of the success with which the final ingathering of souls shall be effected.

These they possessed. A feeling of awe and reverence possessed them. They were of one mind about the marvelous revelation of himself to them. Some strange emotion sealed their lips. He had not manifested himself to the world, but to his disciples, and to them by "the interpretations they were putting upon their own experience" (Westcott). They knew it was the Lord. They looked into that other world. They were lost in silent amaze, and received the revelation once more of their risen Master and Lord.

The Lord gave them symbolically the entire gift of his love by that which he came forward at this moment to supply. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-14.htm">John 21:14</a></div><div class="verse">This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is now</span> - or, as Meyer puts it, this time already is - <span class="cmt_word">the third time that Jesus was manifested</span> (passive, not active, as in ver. 1) <span class="cmt_word">to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples, after that he was risen from the dead</span>; or, when he had been raised from the dead. The implication is that there had up to this time been no other manifestation to groups of his disciples than those which John had related. Therefore those other occurrences mentioned by Luke, Matthew, and Paul must be supposed to lie still in the future. That there were other manifestations is not obscurely hinted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span>. The appearances to the women, to Cephas and James, are not of the class so carefully described by John. The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>, etc., might be regarded as this third manifestation to the disciples (Luthardt). Godet agrees that the two appearances in Luke (Emmaus and Peter) are not reckoned by John, any more than that made to Mary Magdalene. The statement, "to the disciples," is clearly the explanation. Paul mentions the appearance <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Simon Peter; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> then to the twelve (<a href="../../par/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 26</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to the five hundred, at the head of whom may have been the eleven of <a href="../../par/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16-20</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> James; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the twelve (the ascension not described by John). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Since Luke and Paul (Godet) omitted the narrative before us, John is here repairing the omissions of tradition. It seems quite as reasonable to place this third revelation to a group of apostles as the third of Paul's enumerations. John is explicit in recording appearances to the special, combined, and chosen witnesses, while he not only implies, but mentions, other manifestations. Paul recites the special manifestations of various kinds, and gives most important details dropped by other traditions. The apocryphal ' Gospel according to the Hebrews,' as related by Jerome ('Cat. Script. Eccl. "Jacobus"'), quotes the passage which refers to the interview between James and the risen Lord. Gregory of Tours ('Hist. Francorum,' 1:21) refers to the tradition as though he had taken it from some analogous but not identical source (see a full discussion of the passage in Nicholson's 'Gospel according to the Hebrews,' pp. 62-68). If the previous manifestations of the risen Lord were made to love, to thought, to earnest though trembling inquiry, to spiritual vision only, so here we find that, amid the ordinary duties of life and the activities and disappointments of daily service, the Lord manifests himself. The eye of love and the heart of rock are made ready for special assurances of the Master's presence and power to help and guide disciples throughout that mysterious future in which they are to feel and realize his words, "Lo! I am with you always, even to the end of the world."

On two of these occasions the simple humanity of the apostle was the basis on which the Lord proceeded to confer upon him the high official designation. The grace of God, in the first instance, selected Simon of Jonah to be a rock. In the second, "not flesh and blood," but the Father's grace, revealed the mystery of the Divine Sonship to him, and won the name of Peter. In the third, the utter weakness of Simon's own flesh reveals the power of the prayer of Jesus for him, so that he might ultimately convert his brethren; and now "Simon" is reinstated after his fall into his apostolic office. <span class="cmt_word">Simon, son of Jona</span> - or, John (see <a href="../../par/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>, note) - <span class="cmt_word">lovest thou me more than these?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> more than these other disciples love me? Thou hast seen more of my compassion, farther into my heart, deeper into my Person, my position, and my work, than they have done; thou hast dared again and again to ask for higher service and more conspicuous distinction. Thou hast made louder protestations than any of these of thine unworthiness to serve me, and in the deep consciousness of humiliation thou hast been more emphatic than any of them in refusing grace which thou thoughtest it might dishonor me to give. Thou didst indeed say, "Though all men should be offended at me or should deny me," thou wouldst never be offended and never deny me. "Dost thou love me more than they do?" There is no positive reference to the denial and fall of Peter; but the implication and suggestion cannot be hidden, though Hengstenberg and others fail to appreciate it. The circumstance that Peter was "grieved" because the Lord put this question to him a third time makes the reference very little less than explicit. The real significance of the narrative is the reinstitution of Peter in the position of importance he had filled throughout, and an indication of the nature and quality of that service. In Simon's reply, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee</span>, three things are very noticeable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Peter says nothing of the superiority of his affection for his Lord over that of his colleagues. Had they not in outward act been more faithful than he? He could not arrogate any sweeter, dearer, more abounding affection than he was willing to believe that they felt for their Master. It is scarcely worth while to notice the miserable translation that some few commentators have suggested: "Lovest thou me more than (thou lovest) these fishing-smacks and this thriving business on the lake?" Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Peter's admission that the Lord knew his inmost heart, concedes, therefore, that the question was merely intended to test his faithfulness, and force him to a more salutary and binding acknowledgment. Notice <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Peter's change of phraseology. The word used for "love" by the Lord is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, but that which is used in response by the apostle is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>, the love of natural emotion, and even tender, intimate, personal affection. The Latin language, by rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> by amo rather than diligo, expresses the subtle shades of meaning between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>. There is, however, no English word but "love" for them both. The admirable remarks of Archbishop Trench ('Synonyms of New Testament,' &sect; 12.) find special illustration in these verses. Many passages occur in which amo and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> seem to mean more and have deeper intensity than diligo and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>. Amari is the affection which a friend may desire from a friend, even more than diligi; but the latter denotes choice, mental conviction, and self-recognition of the fact. Antony, in his funeral oration over Caesar (Dion Cassius, 41:48, quoted by Trench), says, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus in the New Testament we are continually told of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, but never of the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. God is himself said to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. When, therefore, the Lord here asks Simon, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>," Dost thou esteem me worthy of thy love?" Simon, with a burst of personal affection, says, yet with a certain humility, "I love thee" - meaning, "Such love as I can lavish upon thee, such as I may dare in my humility to offer thee, O my Master, Brother, Friend!" This being the case, <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith, Feed my lambs</span>. Love to Christ is the first, high, main condition of faithful service. The chief of the apostles will have this as his prime, chief, and most laudable service. Each of the terms of the commission, in its threefold repetition, resembles the other; and Meyer says the whole duty of the pastor of souls and earthly shepherd of the flock is involved in each of the three expressions. Our Lord commences, however, with providing true food, seasonable nourishment, for the "lambs" of the flock. The tender emotion involved in the term cannot be excluded, but it is a comprehensive and suggestive one, and embraces the young converts, the first believers, those who with impetuosity and gladness receive the Word; the little children who will literally crowd into the Church become the highest and sacredest care of the chiefest apostles and most honored of pastors. The first, the main thing they need, is the milk of the Word, and the sweetest pastures. This consideration of the next generation, and gracious care for the children and the childlike of every successive age, is one of the sacred signs of Divine revelation. Our Lord is represented in the synopties as "suffering the little children" to "come to" him, as "blessing them," and rejoicing in their hosannas. St. John preserves and glorifies the whole conception by recording this commission of the risen Lord to the greatest of the apostles. If the babes and sucklings had "held their peace, the stones would have cried out," is the pathetic approval of the rejected Lord. "Feed my lambs" is the gracious, unexpected summons of the triumphant Christ and Lord of all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a></div><div class="verse">He saith to him again the second time, Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas</span> (John), <span class="cmt_word">lovest thou me</span>? Here our Lord omits, as Peter had done, the "more than these," but he again, with perhaps deeper meaning, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. Dost thou render me even more in one sense, though less in another, of thy heart's reverence? Dost thou treat me with the confidence and esteem, submission and admiration, which are my due? Again Peter, with his heart bursting with personal affection, feels that he can and must say, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> ere; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> love thee dearly). The commission that follows is the second stage of pastoral office. <span class="cmt_word">He saith to him, Tend</span> ("act the part of shepherd") <span class="cmt_word">my sheep</span>. Christ is the "good Shepherd," and, as Peter puts it in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>, the "chief Shepherd." He has laid down his life with a view of taking it again, and ever after discharging the functions of the Shepherd. He means to bring all the "sheep" into one flock. They shall all hear his voice, and receive from him everlasting life. Meanwhile the leader of the apostles is made to appreciate that love is the condition of all healthy guidance. Faculty for rule is part of the very nature of the pastoral care. The sheep will need this even more than the "lambs;" the old disciples will require, even more than the young converts, both direction and command In this respect the subsequent career of Peter was more conspicuous than that of the rest of the apostles (see <a href="../../par/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a> for the use of the word). But the shepherding of the sheep is an essentially necessary and integral portion of every pastor's care. When assailed by the wolf of heresy, by the hostile marauder, by new conditions of any kind, by special danger, unless he can in self-forgetting love pilot and protect his flock, he is no true shepherd. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a></div><div class="verse">He saith unto him the third time, Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - And now Peter seems to have conquered, by his persistence, the heart of his Lord, and Jesus adopts the very phrase which Peter twice over had substituted for that which he had himself used; for he saith unto him the third time, <span class="cmt_word">Simon, son of Jonas</span> (John), <span class="cmt_word">lovest thou me</span>? (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>;); as if he had said, "Dost thou indeed love me dearly, love me as a friend, love me with the earnestness and fervor that twice over has corrected my word into one more congenial to thee, and more ample and true than that used by myself?" This trait of Peter's character, which John has hinted on several occasions, is abundantly illustrated in the synoptic narrative and in the Acts of the Apostles. <span class="cmt_word">Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me</span>? The grief was natural. The repeated question suggests some doubt about his sincerity, and the adoption of the apostle's own word cut him with a more poignant heart-thrust? He may have thought thus: Jesus seems to distrust the reality of my personal affection. and will not accept my implication that this is more to me than the most thoughtful <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>, the most deeply meditated and measured reverence. He was grieved because a third time seems like an infinite repetition, and, if repeated thus a third time, it may be asked me again and again every day of my life. He was grieved from the irresistible analogy between the threefold denial of which he had been guilty, and this threefold interrogatory. He does not say as before, "Yea, Lord;" but commences, <span class="cmt_word">Lord, thou knowest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">all things</span>. Omniscience  is freely conceded to the Lord. All things that Peter did, thought, or felt, all his bewilderment, all his mistakes, all his impulsiveness and mixture of motive, all his self-assertion, all his weakness and disloyalty, are known; but so also all the inner springs and lines of his nobler nature, and that though he played the fool, he was a hypocrite in his denials. The Lord knew that his faith did not really fail, though his courage did; and in virtue of this breadth of the Lord's knowing, he must have come to full cognizance of the entire meaning of Peter's life. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> (<span class="cmt_word">seest</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hast come fully to know that I love thee!</span> Just because thou intuitively knowest all things. The play on <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is obvious (see <a href="../../par/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him, Feed my little sheep</span>. It is said by some that, even if this be the true reading, we have simply a renewal of the tenderness and strong emotion which led the Lord to speak of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> on the first occasion. Doubtless deep and glowing affection pervades the use of these epithets; but if this be the sole explanation, then the reason of the adoption of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in the second commission is not evident, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> would have answered the purpose. There is distinct progress in the ideas: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Feed my lambs;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Rule (shepherd) my sheep;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Feed my little sheep." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>First, let Peter, let the apostolic company, let any one of the successors of the apostles, learn the delicate duty of supplying the just and appropriate nourishment to those that are young in years or in graces; then let him also learn to guide, direct, protect from outward foes, the mature disciples, and preserve the discipline of the flock, seeking the lost sheep until it be found; and he will find that then a third duty emerges. The sheep that are young in heart, the old men that are childlike in spirit, the trembling sheep that need even more care than the lambs themselves, are specially thrown upon the shepherd's care. Was not Peter himself a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>? Had he not shown that he was a most imperfect master of himself? He was mature in years, but childish as well as childlike in character. He could (for a while) only see one thing at a time, and he was impatient of the future. Mark welt his characteristic words, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man. O Lord!" "That be far from thee, O Lord!" "Why cannot I follow thee now?" "Thou shall never wash my feet!" "Not my feet only, but my hands and my head!" "Let us build for thee three tabernacles!" "Not so; I have never eaten anything common or unclean!" These are familiar illustrations of the childishness and infantile simplicity, babyish audacity, of the old disciple. Even after the Lord has risen from the dead, Peter ventures to correct his language. Christ, moreover, accepts his persistent alteration of the word for "love" item the lips of this <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus the Lord summons him to undertake a duty which he would on reflection be specially able to appreciate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a></div><div class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <i>thee</i> whither thou wouldest not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto thee</span>. This form of address links the pre-resurrection life to that which follows, proclaims the identity of the being and the unity of the Person of the Christ under new conditions. More than that, much solemnity is conferred on this final word of the Master. <span class="cmt_word">When thou wast younger than thou art now</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before thou camest under my sway; when thou wert supreme ruler of the fishing-fleet of Capernaum, with wife and family dependent on thee; when Andrew, James, and John (thy partners) were in a measure all doing thy will, following in thy train, submitting to thy behests, - <span class="cmt_word">thou girdodst thyself</span> for whatever task was set before thee; thou hadst the choice of duties and pleasures; thou hadst time at thy disposal, thy method of service in thine own hands, even as now it was thy will to gird thee for the task of swimming to my feet (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-17.htm">Proverbs 31:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4, 5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/17-8.htm">Luke 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The simple verb is used here in reference to all kinds of "girding"). So that the Lord reminds him of his natural self-will, so conspicuous and prominent, the secret of all his weakness and much of his individuality. <span class="cmt_word">And thou walkedst whither thou wouldest</span>; or literally, thou wert in the habit of walking whithersoever thou weft willing or desiring to do; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thine outward conduct, and the whole line of thy daily enterprise and duty, was not only an utterance of thine own self-mastery, but even thy wishes, the momentary waywardness of thy purposes, found immediate gratification. But a great change has come over thee; thou hast passed through a new experience. Already thou feelest that thou art not thine own; thy heart and strength, thy hands, thy feet, thy very girdle and sandal, are beginning to seem to thee no longer at thine own disposal. Thy self-will is checked, thy natural audacity and power of initiation are repressed into much narrower limits. Thou-hast found thyself weaker than a little child; thou art in need of this Divine principle of "love," deep and fervent, reverential as well as personal, not only to utter bold expressions of regard, but to form the very focus and new central force of thy whole being; and so it will come to pass that this new force will more than master thee; and <span class="cmt_word">when thou shalt be</span> old and gray with years, thy service to that other and higher wilt shall be complete: thou <span class="cmt_word">wilt stretch forth thy hands</span> in token of entire submission to the will of another, however it may be revealed to thee - whether at the instance of "the angel" or "Herod," of "Cornelius" or Nero's executioner! This remarkable phrase has often been supposed to mean the "stretching forth of the hands of the crucified" on his being appended to the cross. But such a process would follow rather than precede the "girding," which is, on such an interpretation, taken literally of the girding that preceded the nailing. There can be no doubt, from the language of St. John, that this was the final and forcible illustration of the new principle that would take full possession of Simon Peter. But meanwhile it was a long life of willing surrender to the Supreme Will which gives its highest meaning to these words. <span class="cmt_word">And another shall gird thee, and carry thee</span>(or, bring thee) <span class="cmt_word">whither thou art not wishing to go</span>. The old self-will, though it be indeed mastered, will not have utterly vanished. If it be not so, where would be the sacrifice? Even the blessed Lord himself said, "Not my will, but thine be done." Verily, even the sanctified nature of the sinless Man, prepared in the spotless womb of the blessed Virgin by the Holy Ghost, anointed by the Spirit, and in living absolute union with the only begotten Son, - even he was, in human consciousness, disposed to cry, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," etc. We need not wonder, then, that to the very last, when the supreme will was manifested to Peter in the approaches of violent death, he should feel the will of the flesh thwarted. The exquisite legend embodied in the "Domiue, quo vadis?" (see <a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>) confirms the entire representation of the character of Peter. So also does the story, preserved by Tertullian ('De Pries.,' 35; ' Ad Scorp.,' 15) and Eusebius ('Hist. Eccl.,' 3:1), that the apostle preferred crucifixion with his head downwards, on the plea that to be crucified as his Master was too great an honor for one that had denied his Lord.

And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This he said</span>, adds the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">signifying by what manner of death, not necessarily crucifixion</span> (Godet), but that violent and martyr-death to which the prince of the apostles was called. How many anticipations, partial beginnings, of the final scene must Peter have passed through before, in utter human helplessness, but in Divine, supernatural strength, he stretched out his hands, allowed another to gird him, prepare him for the day's work, and carry him whither all his nature would shrink to go! There is no other hint whatever of literal crucifixion than this phrase of "stretching out the hand," which is nowhere else applied to the peculiar method in which the crucified ones suffered. Doubtless the transposition of the two phrases must not be pressed too much, since the stretching of the arms might possibly bear the literal interpretation of the action which was forced upon the victim, and the subsequent "girding" refer to the subligaculum, by which he was fastened to the instrument of torture; while the "being carried whither he would not" might, though by some forcing of the phrase, be supposed, though enigmatically and obscurely, to refer to the uplifting of the cross with its living burden. The phrase, "signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God," is peculiarly Johannine (<a href="../../par/john/12-33.htm">John 12:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>). This sublime term for the suffering of the great saints, taken from the light which the Lord's agony had cast upon holy death, became a permanent Christian idea (Suicer, 'Thes.,' 1:949). When John wrote, the fact of Peter's death must have been well known throughout the Church. There is every probability that he had long since been crucified, and the solemnity of the utterance was augmented and pointed by the well-known manner of the death of the illustrious apostle. This was, however, by no means the only meaning that naturally flows out of the warning; nor is Peter's experience the only illustration that it bears. <span class="cmt_word">And when he had spoken this, Jesus saith to him, Follow me.</span> There may have been a primary interpretation derived from Christ's removal to a distance from the rest of the disciples, and the intention of conferring upon Peter there and then, special and further instructions. But from the context, in which the contrasts of life, character, and service are conspicuous, it would seem impossible (Meyer) so to restrict the meaning, as Tholuck and others do. The command is the concentration into one burning utterance of all that is meant by Christian life - that coming into relation with the living Lord, that imitation of his principle of action, which, as St. Paul in Philippians it. has shown, was capable of imitation in the narrower and smaller circle of our human experience. If it be rational for the Lord to have said, "Be ye perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect," and for Paul to have pressed upon his converts, "Be ye followers of God, as dear children;" "Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ," - then the Lord gathered all the rules of conduct which were involved in his previous discourses into one word, when he laid upon the man who should be a fisher of souls, a feeder of lambs, a shepherd of sheep, a feeder of the little sheep of the flock, the comprehensive duty, "Follow me." Those interpretations which make the words mean "Follow me as universal bishop and pastor," as that of Chrysostom does, are incompatible with the narrative; or if we suppose them to signify, "Follow me into the invisible world," or "Imitate me in my martyrdom," this would be unpractical, and by no means in obvious harmony with the kind of injunctions just given. We give the passage from James Innes' translation of Aug., 'Tr.,' 123:4, which Westcott justly implies is beyond translation: "Such was the end reached by that denier and lover; elated by his presumption, prostrated by his denial, cleansed by his weeping, approved by his confession, crowned by his suffering, - this was the end he reached: to die with a perfected love for the Name of him with whom, by a perverted forwardness, he had promised to die. He would do, when strengthened by Christ's resurrection, what in his weaknesss he had promised prematurely. The needful order was that Christ should first die for Peter's salvation, and then that Peter should die for the preaching of Christ." Our Lord, when appealed to with reference to John, does not merely repeat the injunction, "Follow me," but forces upon Peter the original summons. This undoubtedly gives a solemnity and specialty to the work of Peter, to which the subsequent career of John was not an exact parallel. It cannot be said that our Lord in any sense forbids John to follow him, but says that, though John may abide, may rest, may meditate, may see visions and dream dreams, until he the Lord should come, that would in no respect alter the direct advice given to Peter. On referring to the earliest scene described in this Gospel between Jesus and his disciples, we find that "Follow me" was addressed to Philip, Moreover, Andrew and John were, on their first introduction to Jesus as "the Lamb of God," already (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) "following him," and they were even then asking for power or permission to "abide" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) with him. But Peter was not then told to "follow him," but was simply invested with the great name of Cephas (<a href="../../par/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>). These details are obviously supplemented by those before us. The entire phraseology is borrowed from the earlier narrative. The true solution of the problem of the paragraph is that John had followed the Master from the first, and clung to him (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>), abode with him, from those early days till the moment at which these memorable words were uttered. In the journeys to Jerusalem, at the interview with Nicodemus, in Samaria, at the pool of Bethesda, in the hall of the high priest, and in Pilate's Praetorium, at the upper chamber, and in the garden, to the cross, and to the grave of Joseph, the beloved disciple had "followed" his Master. Peter's devotion was intense and at times passionate, but it was marked with a striking disposition, from first to last, to lead as well as "follow," to advise as well as to be guided, to stretch forth his hands, and to gird himself for his own enterprises. But with all his extraordinary peculiarities, he had never really broken the bond or relinquished his faith; and now the Lord in one word corrects every one of his failings anew, and institutes him into his sublime mission by the call, "Follow me." But even yet, Peter's extraordinary characteristic, to guide rather than to follow, leads him once more to lake the initiative. For whatever gesture it was that our Lord made, which induced Peter to think of immediate action, we cannot say; but it would seem that, even before he began to follow, he gave another intensely vivid characterization of himself.

The writer adds, by way of further identification, <span class="cmt_word">he who also leaned back at the supper, upon his breast, and said, Who is he that betrayeth thee?</span> (see notes on John 13:23). The note is here introduced to show the close connection of Peter and the beloved disciple. It was Simon Peter who had beckoned at the supper to the beloved disciple to ask this very question. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-21.htm">John 21:21</a></div><div class="verse">Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <i>shall</i> this man <i>do</i>?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter then,</span> <span class="cmt_word">seeing this man, saith to Jesus, Lord, and this man, what?</span> What is the duty, place, fate, or honor of this man? Paulus and Tholuck suggest in the words the inquiry, "May not this man come now and hear our intercourse, share in my travail and the like?" Meyer supposes it to be dictated by a certain jealousy or curiosity, a consciousness of contrast between his own impetuosity and the beloved disciple's quietude and self-possession. Clearly the inquiry was not altogether pleasing to the Lord, and led him once more to reiterate the original injunction, <span class="cmt_word">If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</span> Do <span class="accented">thou</span> follow <span class="accented">me</span>, and cease to inquire after another's duty. Meyer considers that the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the opposite to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> - that the latter word means "following unto death and martyrdom," while the former means "to be preserved alive," and turns to <a href="../../par/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a> and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a> in vindication. Doubtless that was the crude explanation which led to the subsequent legend of his immortality on earth, and the apostle's own disclaimer; but the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems to be used in <a href="../../par/john/1-37.htm">John 1:37, 39, 40</a>, and in many other places, of the complement and entire fulfillment of the idea and practice of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> - of that abiding in Christ which is the full result of heartfelt following and unquestioning submission to the Savior's will (<a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4, 5, 10</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6, 17, 24, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-15.htm">1 John 4:15</a>). Taking with these passages the corresponding and alternative use of the word to express the manner in which God, truth, or love "abides" in the child of God, it would seem as though it were the keynote of much of John's most mature experience - a fact which is very remarkably elucidated by the passage before us. Baur, Hilgenfeld, Schwegler, Strauss, have urged from this passage that the writer was contending against the Petrine tendency in the Church, by representing John as the higher and more distinguished apostle; and, according to Kostlin, a precisely opposite expression was conveyed by the unknown writer, who meant to flatter the Roman primacy, in the second century, by the dignities thus conferred upon the chief of the apostles. Both hypotheses are baseless. The beloved disciple quietly accepts here the role of "abiding," "waiting," "resting in the Lord," and admits the superior energy and constant initiation which Peter was, as a man, constrained to pursue. There is no jealousy between them, nor the hint of it. John receives more than he asks. "If I will that he abide till I come," etc., has been variously interpreted (the condition is not a simple supposition, there is a probability or uncertainty in the period of the "abiding" - the apodosis declares the as yet unuttered condition to be without bearing on Peter's immediate duty). Some have said that it means, "If I will that he enjoy the long life and the natural death of one who rests with Christ until he comes to take him home by a quiet departure, until he comes to receive him to himself" (<a href="../../par/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>. So Ewald and Olshausen). This view is improbable, because most certainly in that sense, Peter too followed and tarried and abode with Christ till the day when he was taken home. Luthardt suggests that the saying, as here given and interpreted by John himself, not of physical immortality, but of the coming itself, is John's way of asserting that the Lord has come; that in the fall of Jerusalem, A.D. 70, the destruction of the theocracy, and the obvious establishment of the true kingdom in all the world was the "coming," the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of which the Savior had always spoken. John "sees the coming of the Lord in that event." In this general interpretation, Stier and Hengstenberg concur. Westcott throws more light upon it by wisely emphasizing (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the coming, not as one great event, but that continuous realization of his return which is the lofty privilege of faith; and shows that in numerous places <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> points, not so much to the ultimate consummation, as to the interval which will elapse between the commencement and the consummation of the coming (cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a> (with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-2.htm">Luke 19:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>). How frequently has Christ spoken, in the latest discourses, of coming again, to fill the sorrowing with joy, to teach in the power of the Comforter, to judge the prince of this world, to raise and quicken the dead! Such abiding is the full issue of faithful following. Surely two types of character pervade the whole dispensation the Martha and the Mary types; the faithful servant who works and trades with his talents, and the virgin who waits for the Bridegroom; and these two types both meet with appropriate advice. Simon is bidden to follow, and, occupied with busy cares of the Church, leave results to Christ; but John, who has passed into the sanctuary of holy love, is encouraged to rest patiently, and in obscurity and silence, to glory and serve by "standing and waiting."

The more familiar names of "disciples" and "children," "servants" and "apostles," are used in the Gospels. The Acts and Epistles introduce a new group of titles, e.g. "believers" as well as "brethren," "saints" as well as "disciples," "Christians," "slaves and soldiers of Christ," "sons of God," "priests and kings," and "little children;" but now, acting on the Divine hint of the Lord's own words, John speaks of his fellow-disciples who are called into the sacred fellowship as "brethren." The word went forth that that disciple dieth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "the disciple whom Jesus loved"). This was not an unnatural supposition, as his age advanced, and he was regarded as the "great light of Asia," the depositary of the latest traditions, as the link between the days of our Lord's ministry and two succeeding generations of believers, the seer of mighty visions, the enemy of all unrighteousness, and the apostle of love to the lost. In virtue of this very tradition, three hundred years later it was said that the holy apostle was still sleeping in his tomb at Ephesus, and that the dust moved lightly on his heaving breast (Augustine, 'Tr. on John,' 124:2). Here was the beginning of a genuine myth, which, having no real root in fact, failed to establish itself. "John the Baptist is risen from the dead," exclaimed Herod Antipas, "and therefore mighty powers energize in him." But there was no life and no truth in the story, and even among the disciples of St. John Baptist it did not take any place as a supposed fact. It is interesting to see that here a myth was started without positively bad faith, and based itself upon a recorded saying of the Lord; but it perished! The aged apostle strikes the folly dead with one stroke of his pen. The language is remarkable, as helping to prove that John wrote this chapter as well as the rest of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said not unto him, that he dieth not; but, If I will that he abide while I am ever coming, what is that to thee</span>?

The tradition is not authoritatively condemned; but it is shown to be a mere inference, one inference out of many, from words partially understood. The Epistles of John show how deeply John pondered the idea, and how much he crowded into the words, "abide in him," until the coming, and before and during and after the various comings of the Lord to him. Mr. Browning, in 'A Death in the Desert,' makes St. John say in his last hours - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If I live yet, it is for good, more love<br />Through me to men: be naught but ashes here<br />That keep awhile my semblance, who was John -<br />Still when they scatter, there is left on earth."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">No one alive who knew (consider this!) -<br />Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands<br />That which was from the first, the Word of life.<br />How will it be when none more saith, 'I saw '?<br />Such ever was love's way: to rise, it stoops.<br />Since I, whom Christ's mouth taught, was bidden teach,<br />I went, for many years, about the world,<br />Saying, 'It was so; so I heard and saw,'?<br />Speaking as the ease asked: and men believed.</span> *   *   * <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"To me that story - ay, that Life and Death<br />Of which I wrote 'it was' - to me it is;  -<br />Is, here and now: I apprehend naught else.<br />Yea, and the Resurrection and Uprise<br />To the right hand of the throne -...<br />I saw the Power; I see the Love, once weak,<br />Resume the Power; and in this word 'I see'<br />Lo, there is recognized the Spirit of both<br />That moving o'er the spirit of man, unblinds<br />His eye and bids him look....<br />Then stand before that fact, that Life and Death,<br />Stay there at gaze, till it dispart, dispread,<br />As though a star should open out, all sides,<br />Grow the world on you, as it is my world."</span> In ver. 23 we find the significant close of the Fourth Gospel, and there is much to make it highly probable that the two remaining verses were added by the Ephesian elders, as their certificate of its authorship, and their identification of the beloved disciple with the author of the Gospel. It differs from the similar passage, <a href="../../par/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>, where the writer himself gives his own autoptic testimony to the great miracle of the spear-thrust; and where that testimony is declared by himself to be <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, "veritable," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> answering to the very idea of testimony.

It does not need that any of the elders should have seen the Lord to justify the use of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Meyer supposes that these words, notwithstanding their plural form, simply show that John identifies himself with his readers, and, from the peculiar delicacy of his mind, hides himself and his individuality among them or behind them. Alford compares it with <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We have seen his glory," and <a href="../../par/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18</a>. Chrysostom and Theophylact read, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>," I indeed know that his testimony is true." This ingenious method is rejected by modern scholars, on the principle that the writer would not thus have passed from third person to first. This does not seem to be insuperable: Paulus adopted this solution. The chief difficulty of admitting that these words are a note by the Ephesian presbyters, and of ignoring Chrysostom's suggestion, is that ver. 25 contains an unquestionable reintroduction of the first person in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This difficulty is, however, surmounted by Meyer, on the supposition that the last verse is not Johannine. Meyer and Tischendorf (who excludes it from his text) suppose it to have been a gloss by later hands, one which departs from the gravity and dignity of an apostle by its strong hyperbole. Still no codex but the Sinaitieus omits it, and the omission may be due to the loss of the last folio, on which it may have been written; while every other codex contains it. Godet thinks the writer was one of the elders who had joined in the previous authentication, and refers to "the strange notice which Tischendorf records from a manuscript in the Vatican, that Papias was the secretary to whom John dictated the entire Gospel," and imagines that the hyperbolic style of sores of the extant fragments of Papias might account for the extravagance of the statement it contains. Lange and Alford regard the whole verse, together with ver. 24, as Johannine, and suppose that John here speaks in propria persona when the fullness of his memory baffled all expression. Some treat the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., as a possible saying of John's which was added by the authors of both verses. We think that the presence of the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (a very unusual word in the New Testament) is possibly accounted for by the recollection which some of those who had often heard the beloved apostle speak may have had of his way of describing the superlative richness of the life of our Lord, and that the brief appendix by those who bore this testimony to the veracity and authenticity and apostolic origin of the whole narrative is of priceless value. Undoubtedly it asserts with perfect clearness that John the son of Zebedee was the author of the Gospel. If, nevertheless, the work be that of a forger, who secured an accomplice in his deed of imposition, he is a moral anomaly; for, while acting so unworthily, he was nevertheless glorifying the doctrine that God is true, and that every lie is of the devil (<a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), and has produced a work which turns from end to end on a realization of the truth. The words on which so many speculations have been raised are - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a></div><div class="verse">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.

Some have suggested the idea that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, means "morally contain," "bear with.... endure." This is unsatisfactory. The writer, by the use of the name "Jesus," is not going back to the pre-existing, premundane activity of the Logos, but is simply conveying his enthusiastic sense of the inexhaustible fullness of the human life of the blessed Lord. The whole redeeming life, word, and work of the Word made flesh had a quality of infinity about it. The entire evangelic narrative has only touched the fringe of this vast manifestation, a few hours or days of the incomparable life. Every moment of it was infinitely rich in its Contents, in its suggestions, in its influence. Every act was a revelation of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Spirit, giving vistas into the eternities, and openings into the heart and bosom of Deity. Let all that thus was done take thought-shape in human minds, and word-shape in human speech, and book-shape or embodiment in human literature, and there are no conceivable limits to its extent. We use such expressions continually, without feeling that we are adopting any unnatural or unhealthy hyperbole. The infinite abundance of the teaching and significance of the blessed life of the Son of God is ample justification of the apostolic enthusiasm.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 20"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/2.htm"><title>John 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/1.htm" title="John 1">&#9668;</a> John 2 <a href="../john/3.htm" title="John 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 3:2-4.</span> <span class="accented">The testimony of signs to the glory of the Word made flesh.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The first sign, the beginning of signs, Mastery over the old creation. Sign of love and power.</span> The description of the preceding narrative, given in ver. 11, is the true key to it. It is impressive on several accounts. Christ had not yet given any "sign" of the invisible and eternal glory which the evangelist in his prologue had claimed for him. He had not in his own person "manifested" the unique majesty of his will, nor revealed the direction in which the power he wielded would most freely move. John, by this statement, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> puts down a positive disclaimer of the whole cycle of portents which, when he wrote, had begun to hover in romantic and exaggerated fashion around the infancy and minority of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> He shows that his purpose is to bring back from forgetfulness the primary and most impressive events which did in reality characterize the earliest ministry of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He emphasizes the scene of some of these manifestations as restricted to a spot which, however difficult actually to identify, was nevertheless in Galilee, in which prophecy had foretold a great manifestation of Divine light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> He lays stress on the fact that the prime object of it was to convey to his <span class="accented">disciples</span>, to men who knew that he was the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lamb of God, something of the power which he had for meeting any emergency that might arise. He did not seek to promote, nor did he succeed in exciting, the village wonder at a magical entertainment; nor did the bridegroom, nor the governor of the feast, nor so far as we know even Mary herself, fully apprehend in the event what "the disciples" saw. These disciples were probably acting the part of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. They were admitted to a great sign of superhuman power. <span class="accented">They</span> believed on him. This is all we are told of the effect of the "sign." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The entire originality of the sign, one for which the previous narrative and prologue do not in the least prepare us, is one of the continual surprises of this Gospel. The introductory notes of this great symphony are such that we might be disposed to conjecture beforehand that One who is the Logos made flesh, whose glory is that of an only begotten Son of God, who is the predestined Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, who is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world, and the Link and Ladder between heaven and earth, the predicted Messiah and Son of Man, will with Divine aloofness scarce touch with his feet this common earth. Human homes and love and festal rejoicings  are so immeasurably beneath him that he can neither augment their earthly exhilaration nor take part in such carnal and mundane considerations. Such ideas may have crowded the imagination of the sons of Zebedee, of Philip too and of Nathanael. Already they may have been losing in a maze of mystery the Divine humanity, the intense and tender sympathy of Jesus with our everyday life, the profound interest felt in our earthly career. They may have needed to be taught some great lesson of the blending of the sacred with the secular, of the water of purification with the true, strong, fragrant wine of the kingdom. They may have needed, at this moment, the prosaic return to ordinary life over which their new Lord would preside, and from which he would never stand aloof. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> All this is, moreover, highly accentuated by the peculiar character of this sign. It was a creative act. The idea that it was merely a hastening by his will of the natural processes by which water is always being transformed into wine by the vine, seems contradicted by the fact that the vine does <span class="accented">not</span> transform water into wine, but combines with the water other substances, cunningly and wondrously mixing with it the organic compounds which it subtracts from the air and soil, and which are necessary for the purpose. Water which has become wine is not transubstantiated into wine. The water is still there; but there are added to it other elements and compounds. The lesson is undoubtedly taught that he who performed this prodigy called certain elements and forces into being by the simple flat of his will. Evolutionary hastening of natural processes do not in the least apply. If that took place which the disciples (John among them) saw and handled and tasted, then we have an undeniable act of creation. There was then no other antecedent to this new category of existence except the will of Christ. This is the obvious intention of the historian. Other explanations are offered. The rationalistic hypothesis of a quiet and pious fraud on the part of Mary is too gross for belief. The mere magic, or sleight of hand, is so utterly foreign to the narrative that, though Renan seems to favour it, the entire place assigned to the "miracle" renders it utterly inconceivable. Some have gone so far as to say that the interesting discourse of Jesus during the repast inclined the guests to believe that, though their thirst had been quenched with pure water, it was veritable and precious wine. This Reuss call <span class="accented">un surcroit d'absurdite.</span> To suppose, with Ewald and Lange, that it was a miracle upon the minds of the guests, who believed they had drunk wine, when in reality they had only tasted water, is, as Weiss admits, another form of the natural explanation. Why, moreover, should the didactic energy of Jesus not more frequently have produced a like impression? The hypothesis of Strauss is far more rational, viz. that we have here the mythopoeic tendency at full work. Seeing that Moses sweetened the bitter waters, and transformed the Nile into blood, and that Elijah multiplied the oil in the widow's cruse, so Strauss contended that the Messiah must have done the like, and that this "miracle of luxury" is one of the glorifying myths by which Jesus is supposed to have transformed the water of Jewish ceremonial into the wine of the kingdom of grace. This theory is refuted by the enormous difficulty of finding any party in the Church, or of discovering any tendency in the Christian community or outside in the Hellenic schools, which could have evolved such an event - so capable of being misinterpreted - and that too out of a moral consciousness diametrically opposed to such an idea of Messiah. Certainly a vastly preponderating element of the gospel is clean contrary to such an idea of the Christ. Apart from there being some historic fact underlying the story, it seems incredible that it should have been invented by Christian, or Gnostic, or Hebrew tradition. The same may be said of Baur's hypothesis and of Keim's, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the pseudo-John invented the miracle to embody the idea of contrast between the disciples of John the Baptist and of Christ; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the saying of Jesus, "Shall the children of the bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them?" needed embodiment in some concrete fact; or that of Reuss, who supposes that the author, having invented a series of imaginary interviews, and testimonies, must need cap them with a miracle. Thoma sees in the representation the evangelist's sublimation of the banquet in the house of Levi, under  the form of the Wisdom or Logos festival of <a href="../../par/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>. and Ecclus. 1:16-18 and Proverbs 24:1-25. The Logos is here the symposiarch, and the feast corresponds with the bridal festival of the Apocalypse. Several hypotheses have been fashioned, in order to explain the forgery of the narrative, and they are quite as numerous as the attempted solutions by orthodox expositors of the purpose or significance of the miracle. It is perfectly gratuitous and arbitrary on the part of Baur to condemn the <span class="accented">narrative</span> because he could not find support for it in the synoptic Gospels. We have seen (see Introduction) that each evangelist, and especially Matthew and Luke, had separate access to a group of facts and sayings peculiar to himself, and nearly as numerous and memorable as those which characterize the Fourth Gospel. Baumgarten-Crusius is wrong in placing this event at the lowest point of the series of miracles of this Gospel. It is necessary to complete the view which the evangelist formed of the miraculous power of Christ, for him to demonstrate authority over the matter (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) of the created universe. In ch. 6. he illustrates Christ's relation to the <span class="accented">forces</span> of nature, when the Lord hushed the storm and walked on the sea; in ch. 21, by narrating a miraculous draught of fishes, he exhibits the Lord's control over the <span class="accented">animate</span> creation; and in other instances, the like mastery over the human body, over its diseases, necessities, and death (see ch. 4. 5, 6, 11.). If the other evangelists have passed it by, we must remember that they ignore the entire period of our Lord's activity which intervened between the temptation and the imprisonment of John the Baptist. The disciple to whom Jesus on the cross entrusted the care of his mother might have special reasons for recording almost the only scene in which that mother played any part. The most impressive circumstance is that the disciples of John, who had learned his stern denunciation of sin and his call to repentance, were to be taught that the highest life was not to be secured by abjuring marriage, and throwing a tragic gloom over human life, but by hallowing and consecrating the home, the source and nurse of the natural life. Christ first purifies the home, then the temple, then the individual. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the third day there was a marriage in</span> <span class="cmt_word">Cana</span>  <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</span> Should the supposed discovery of Bethabara or Bethany beyond Jordan, at a spot a short distance south of the Lake of Gennesareth, be verified, then there is no difficulty in accepting the view of Baur as to the identity of the "third day," reckoning it as the morrow of the day on which Nathanael was called to be a disciple. The first day mentioned would be <a href="http://bible.cc/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; the second day, <a href="http://bible.cc/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35</a>; and the third identical with the day mentioned in <a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43, 45</a>. There would be time for the rapid journey from the Jordan to Cana. But if the third day be interpreted more naturally, as the third after the day mentioned in <a href="../../par/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44-51</a>, time is given for the journey from the traditional site near Jericho to either of the sites which claim to be the scene of this earliest miracle. It is a march of twenty hours, which would occupy two or three days. Moreover, as wedding feasts often occupied in Palestine seven or even fourteen days (<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>; <a href="http://bible.cc/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>; Tobit 8:19 Tobit 9:4 Tobit 10:1), the festivities may have been advanced, and some explanation be thus given of the exhaustion of the supply of wine. Consequently, there are several justifications and explanations of that which is condemned by Baur and others as an unhistorical element. It' the first day was that on which John bore his testimony before the Sanhedrin; the second, <a href="http://bible.cc/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; the third, <a href="http://bible.cc/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35</a>; the fourth, <a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43, 45</a>; - the day of the wedding at Cana would be the seventh, and thus a sacred week, corresponding with the solemn week that terminated with Easter Day, would be seen to have found place in the earliest periods of the ministry. <span class="accented">The mother of Jesus was there.</span> Since Nathanael of Cana was summoned as a friend, and since the first group of the disciples were familiar with <span class="accented">each</span> other and him, the inference is that the bride or bridegroom was an intimate friend of the entire party. Weiss claims the reference to the little town of Cana "as another of those recollections, which testify indubitably to the historical character of the Gospel" ('Life of Christ,' vol. 1. p. 377). The presence of the mother of the Lord at Cana makes it also probable that she had, after the death of Joseph, removed from Nazareth to Cana. This is confirmed by the casual remark in <a href="http://bible.cc/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a> that his sisters only were still resident in their former home. Moreover, it would explain the return of Jesus from the scene of his baptism to his temporary home (but see ver. 12). The traditional <span class="accented">Kefr Kenneh</span> is situated on  rising ground four miles and a half northeast of Nazareth, and the remains of a Greek church are still to be seen there. The site is not inconsistent with the conditions. We may suppose it to be called "of Galilee" to distinguish it from a Cana in <span class="accented">Peraea</span> mentioned by Josephus ('Vita,' 16:1); but more probably from the Kanah in the tribe of Asher, mentioned in <a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>. The situation of this town in Phoenicia may have been so far from Galilee proper as to have rendered the expression desirable. Dr. Robinson believed that he had hit more certainly upon the site by finding a small village bearing the name <span class="accented">Cana el Djelil</span>, or Khurbet Kana, which lies some seven miles northeast from Nazareth beyond <span class="accented">Sepphoris.</span> The adjunct, <span class="accented">el Djelil</span>, suggested the preservation of the old designation drawn from this very narrative. This identification was accepted by Ritter and Meyer; Stanley considered it very doubtful, and so do Westcott ('Comm.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) and Dr. Selah Merrill, in 'Pict. Palestine,' 2, pp. 59-63. The more recent investigations of the Palest. Expl. Society have led once more to the recognition of the traditional site, independently maintained by Hengstenberg, Godet, Moulton, and others. Its site is picturesque, and resembles the position of many Italian towns perched on the slope of a low hill at the head of valleys forming roadways to the coast and to the lake. Its Greek name, Cana, meaning "a reed," was probably derived from the reeds which grow in the marshy plain below it (compare Cannae, Canossa, Cannes. So Hugh Macmillan). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And both Jesus was called</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, aorist, not pluperfect, and contrasted with the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 1) - after his return from Bethany - <span class="cmt_word">and his disciples to the marriage.</span> Jesus had no disciples before the events recorded in the previous chapter. These men may have been friends of each other and of the bridal party, and received such an invitation before their visit to the banks of the Jordan; but it is far more probable that these individuals already mentioned, or that some of them, and that most certainly John his near relative (see Introduction), were invited, because they were in the society of Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-3.htm">John 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - A large accession of guests in such a humble home might easily be supposed to make a famine in the provisions, and so we read, <span class="cmt_word">And when the wine failed</span>  - either from this cause, or from the poverty of the hosts, whose willingness and welcome were larger than their means, or by reason of an advanced stage in the festival - <span class="cmt_word">the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no</span> <span class="cmt_word">wine</span>. The simple presence of the Lord and of his mother, of such guests as these. at a wedding feast, is a Divine rebuke of all that morbid asceticism which crept from Essenism and Orientalism into the Christian Church, of all that false pietism and fancied purity which made marriage a contamination, and exalted virginity to an unnatural elevation. The tender hearted interest felt by the blessed mother of the Lord in the condition of the hosts, and her tone of authority towards the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, are eminently natural; her tacit request for help, though she does not specify the way in which the help should be given, implies on her part something of presumption in indicating to our Lord the course he should adopt. A question of great interest arises - What did she mean by her appeal? Bengel suggested that Mary simply intended: "Let us depart before the poverty of our hosts reveals itself." This makes Christ's reply an acceptance of her hint; but along other lines the rabbis were accustomed to say that wine and life were in the mouth of a rabbi (see Geikie's 'Life of Christ,' 1:475; Wunsche, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). We are expressly told that this is the beginning of signs, and therefore we have no right to conclude that, previous to this, in the home at Nazareth, Jesus had been accustomed to conquer fate and master poverty and compel circumstances by miraculous powers for his own or for his mother's support. We know that it was a temptation of the devil that he should perform some such miracle for his own sustenance, and that he had sternly suppressed the suggestion of the evil one. The mother must have known his powers, and must have known his mind on this very matter. What did she suggest? Was she thinking mainly of the need of wine, or firstly and chiefly of the honour and glory of her Son? She supposed that a moment had arrived when he should by some royal act assert his imperial rights, and give an order which would be obeyed as that of Sovereign Prince. Precisely the same spirit prevailed always in his home and among his disciples - an eager desire that he should manifest himself to the world (cf. <a href="../../par/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4-6</a>). The disciples did not lose it on the night of the Passion, or the eve of the Ascension (<a href="../../par/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). If this was the real meaning of the remark, "They have  no wine," it becomes singularly interesting to observe the method of our Lord. The request for a supply of additional solace and refreshment <span class="accented">was</span> complied with. The suggestion to show himself to the world was as resolutely withheld. There was no pomp, no claim, no self-assertion; there was quiet, boundless, affluent love. The glory of Divine love was manifested, the need was satisfied; but the impression was not intended to go beyond the hearts of those beings who would partially understand it, at the right time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - With this thought, the reply of Jesus to the premature suggestion of the mother becomes perfectly comprehensible. <span class="cmt_word">What is there to me and thee, O woman? Mine hour has not yet come.</span> The appellation "woman" was used by him upon the cross, when he was concerned most humanly and tenderly with her great grief and desolation, and therefore had no breath of unfilial harshness in it (cf. <a href="../../par/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>; Dio Cassius, 'Hist.,' 51:12, where Augustus addresses Cleopatra, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Maldonatus admits that Catholics "in varias tamen de sensu hujus loci sententias distracti sunt"). But the proverbial <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>; wheresoever the words occur, imply, if net personal estrangement, yet as to the matter in hand some divergence of feeling (see <a href="../../par/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>; see also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>). Almost all commentators seem to suggest that our Lord refused to be guided by a mother's direction; that he wished her to understand that he was breaking off from her control and from that silent submission which he had hitherto willingly yielded (so Meyer, Hengstenberg, Godet, Westcott, Tholuck, Ebrard, and Lange). Schaff has quoted from the Fathers before the Nestorian controversy dear proof that they admitted censure, and therefore blame, in the blessed Virgin Mary. Still, it seems to me that the cause of the censure, coupled with an immediate response to her special request about the wine, has not been sufficiently appreciated, he said, "Mine hour is not yet come." It would have come if the provision of wine was the ground of divergence of sentiment; if the moment for the supply of these temporal wants were the point of difference between them. The "hour" for Christ to tell the world all that Mary knew had <span class="accented">not</span> come. The hour of the full revelation of his Messianic claims had not come, nor did it come in the temple, or by the lake, or in the feast day; not till the awful moment of rejection, when death was hovering over him, and the blow was about to fall, did he say, "The hour has come" (see <a href="../../par/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>) - the hour of his greatest glory. "The hour had not yet come." The hour would come when rivers of living water would be supplied to all those who come to him; when the blood he would shed would be a Divine stream, clear as crystal, for the refreshment of all nations; when at another marriage supper of a saved humanity the precious blood should be an ample supply of costly wine for all the world. Moreover, the link at the present moment between our Lord and his mother must begin to shade into something more spiritual. It was not possible that he should be holden by it. A sword would pierce through her maternal heart when she became gradually alive to the fact that they that do the will of his Father, the same were his "brothers, sisters, and mother." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His mother saith unto the servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). The habits of Oriental life at the present day make it extremely probable that the disciples of Jesus were themselves taking the place of those who graciously waited upon the guests. If so, the language of Mary to them, and the special effect of the whole scene upon their minds, become marked and suggestive. Be that as it may, the mother of Jesus clearly understood by the gentle rebuke she received, that Christ, her Son, had read her heart, and was going in some way, not to gratify her darling wish, but at least to take her hint for the consolation of her young friends, and to attend to her suggestion. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span> Though in some sense slighted or reproved, she exhibits the most entire confidence in her Son and Lord. She encourages the servants to do whatever he might command. More may have passed between them than is reported. The evangelist often suggests omitted details (as in <a href="../../par/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1, 2</a>; and elsewhere). The faith of Mary was not depressed by the discovery that there were depths of character in her Son which she could not fathom. Obedience to Christ will always be our duty, even though we cannot penetrate the reasons of his command. An interesting illustration of Mary's words may be seen in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-55.htm">Genesis 41:55</a>, where Pharaoh gives the like injunction to his servants concerning Joseph. Archdeacon Watkins records a curious tradition, mentioned by Jerome in his Prologue to the Gospel, that John was himself the bridegroom, but that, guided by the miracle, he left all and followed Christ (see Sears' 'Heart of Jesus,' Trench, 'Miracles,' p. 98). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there were</span> (<span class="accented">set</span>, or) <span class="cmt_word">placed there six water pots of stone, after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span> Stone was often used for these receptacles, as more calculated to preserve the purity of the water (Wunsche refers to 'Beza,' 2:2; Westcott quotes 'Sofa,'  4; Barclay, in his translation of 'Mishna,' &sect; 17, enumerates earthenware and other material as lawful). It is interesting that these stone jars are still used in this very neighbourhood for like purposes ('Pict. Palestine'). This large number of jars of considerable magnitude was doubtless due in part to the number of the guests, and to the scrupulous attention to ceremonial purity that was enjoined by the oral law (see 'Mishna,' &sect; 17; and Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They were accustomed to wash, not only the hands, but "cups, brazen vessels, and tables" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a> and parallel passages). (For this use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>, in which "according to" easily passes into the sense of "for the sake of, after the manner of.") The Attic measure <span class="accented">metretes</span> was equal to the Hebrew <span class="accented">bath</span> (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:02. 9), and stands for it in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>, and this equalled 1.5 Roman <span class="accented">amphorae</span>, 8 gallons + 7.5 pints. So that six jars containing 2 or 3 metretes, say 2.5   =   6 x 2.5 x 8 gallons + 7.5 pints   =   6 x 2.5 &times; 71.5 pints   =   134 gallons and a fraction. The jars may have differed in shape, according as they were adapted for different purposes; but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span> must be translated distributively, and we cannot evade the enormous capacity of the jars, and therefore the abundance of the gift thus provided. Various efforts have been made to reduce the extent of the provision; but the obvious implication of the narrative is that the six jars were the <span class="accented">locale</span> of the miracle. Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott suggest that these water pots were filled with pure water, but that the wine was "drawn" from the water supply to which the servants had access, and that no more wine was provided than that which was borne to the governor of the feast. Others have supposed that simply the water <span class="accented">drawn</span> from the jars was transformed in the process. These suppositions make the entire reference to the water pots extremely obscure and unnecessary. The large quantity of wine thus offered to these humble folks corresponds with the affluence of Nature in all her moods - the munificence of spring blossoms, the harvest of the sea, the exuberance of sunlight, the superfluity of rain that falls on the oceans, the copiousness of all God's ways. When, on other occasions, the Lord added to the supplies of food in fishes and bread, his lavish abundance corresponds with the riches of his loving kindness on this occasion. There was provided, not the material for a meal, but an ample dowry for such a bride. No mere magical change, momentarily confounding perception and leaving no trace behind, but a supply which would be a standing proof of the reality of what had been done.

And they filled them to the brim.</span> They had, therefore, been emptied already for the purifying purposes and processes of the large party, probably suggesting that the friends of the bridegroom were solicitous to obey the religious discipline which was believed to be in harmony with the Divine will. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, seems added to emphasize the quantity of wine thus provided. The miracle took place between the filling of the jars and their being drawn upon. We are not permitted to look more closely into this mystery. The finger of God, the will of the Creator, determines the result. The servants knew that they had filled the jars with water. The next thing, and all that we know, is that the Lord said - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-8.htm">John 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw forth</span> (the object of the verb is not in the sentence. He did not say the "water" which you placed there, nor the "wine" into which it has been transformed, but simply, "Draw forth"), <span class="cmt_word">and bear to the governor of the feast.</span> The traditional interpretation, that the water jars were the source of the unwonted supply, and the measure of it, strongly commends itself in preference to the suggestions of Westcott, Moulton, as well as Barnes, Olshausen, and others. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the "master of the table," is the chief servant presiding over the arrangements of the feast. This was an Attic official, referred to by Athenaeus (4, 100, 70) as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. Heliodor., 7:27). The "symposiarch," <span class="accented">arbiter bibendi</span>, is not to be confounded with him. The latter was one of the guests chosen to taste the wine, etc. (see Ecclus. 32:1, where he is called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The "governor" is one who occupies a still higher position of importance in Greek feasts. There is no other trace of the Attic usage among the Jews. As the passage in Ecclesiasticus indicates a different custom, and the references to something similar describe the officer by different names, no very sure conclusion can be drawn. Wunsche says that, ordinarily, the master of the house was bound to serve his guests, and preside over the distribution of food and presents. Thus, at the marriage of his son, Rabbi Gamaliel served all his invited guests. Trench, Alford, and Wordsworth think that the governor here was one of the invited guests, from the freedom with which he addressed the bridegroom. Meyer, Godet, take the view that he was not. <span class="cmt_word">And they bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>,  conscious of a wondrous fact, which must have filled them with  consternation. At first the order must have seemed like folly, as when Moses called on Israel to "go forward" into the Red Sea, or as when Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take up thy bed, and walk." "They bear it." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-9.htm">John 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the governor of the feast tasted the water which had become wine.</span> Luther translated, "Den Wein der Wasser gewesen war" - "The wine which had been water." No other explanation is possible than one that asserts an astounding contravention of the ordinary evolutions and sequences of nature. If wine has taken the place of water, there has been added to the water that which was not there before. The vine, with all its wondrous processes - the vineyard, the wine press, and other appliances - have all been dispensed with, and the same power which said, "Let there be light," called these additional elements together, originated them by his will. The new properties presented themselves to the percipient senses. In this respect the transformation is profoundly different from the supposed change which occurs in the Holy Eucharist. There the accidents and elements all remain; the <span class="accented">substantia</span> underlying them is supposed to be replaced by another <span class="accented">substantia</span>; but neither the one nor the other substance has ever been present to the senses. Here a new substance, with previously undiscovered attributes, presents itself. The uncompromising opponents of the supernatural will accept almost any interpretation but that which lies on the surface. The rationalistic, mythical, poetic mystic explanations all alike are encumbered with special difficulties. The evangelist who held Christ to be the Logos incarnate saw nothing inconceivable in the event. It was one of many phenomena which accompanied his life as the "Son of man," which helped to create the underlying presupposition on which the Gospel was written. Like the testimony of the last of the prophets and the earliest of the disciples, it is part of the evidence that the Logos dwelt among us. When the governor tasted wine drawn from these water pots, <span class="cmt_word">and knew not whence it was.</span> He had known all the resources of the feast, but this puzzled him by its novelty. "Whence has it come? Where has it been stored? Whose is it?" An interesting parenthesis is here introduced, to contrast the ignorance of the ruler of the feast with the overwhelming mystery of knowledge given to the servants (the disciples of Jesus himself), [<span class="cmt_word">But the servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who drew the water knew</span>]; knew, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whence it was and, it seems to me, <span class="accented">what</span> it was. Meyer and others say they did not know that they had brought wine. It is impossible to assert as much as this. They knew the plain fact that it was not a wine vat or wine cask, but a water jar, from which they had drawn in order to fill the chalices in their hands. They became, therefore, guarantors of the mysterious sign. How much more than "whence" it was had dawned on their mind we cannot say. <span class="cmt_word">The governor of the feast calleth the bridegroom.</span> We may judge from this that this responsible person was not in the room where the six water jars were placed, and that he either approached the bridegroom in his seat of honour, or called to him from his own, and expressed, by a convivial boast and equivocal compliment, his sense of the excellence of the wine which had thus, at the end of the feast, been lavished on the guests, who had been hitherto kept strangely ignorant of the resources of the host. It is unnecessary to put into the words any meaning deeper than the epigrammatic humour in which he revealed his sense of the reality of the objective fact which had been brought to his knowledge. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <i>but</i> thou hast kept the good wine until now.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And saith, Every man at the first setteth on the good wine, and when men have drunk deeply, then that which is worse</span> (literally, <span class="accented">smaller</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thou hast kept</span> (<span class="accented">guarded</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the good wine until now.</span> The classical passages supposed to illustrate this jovial saying throw little light upon it. The meaning is obvious enough, and there is no need to search in ancient wit for the original of a speech which is not too recondite to have been originated on this occasion. The best wine is appropriately given when the seneca are keenest, but when the climax of the festival has come, when they have drunk too deeply, or are intoxicated, then the weaker, poorer, and less fragrant wine is acceptable. There need be no reference whatever to the present company. Tholuck and the Revised Version modify the force of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>; Meyer, Godet, and others see no difficulty in assigning to the word its proper meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/12-45.htm">Luke 12:45</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>). The whole saying simply asserts, by an outsider, the concrete reality of a wonderful change that had occurred. He knew nothing of a miracle. He merely guaranteed unwittingly the phenomena that came within the range of his senses. This becomes more impressive because he knew nothing of the cause, and was profoundly ignorant of the claims of his strange and wonderful Guest. No further remark is offered. We are not told how the fact was referred to the will or authority of Jesus, to the kindness or generosity of the mother; or whether the company generally learned the mysterious powers of their fellow Guest. The bridegroom thus honoured made no reply that is recorded; and, by emphatic silence, the impression is conveyed  that this manifestation of the power of the Lord was not, in his opinion, the coming of his "hour." Strange reticence is observed, but this is added - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus made this beginning of signs in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory.</span> The beginning, the earliest of the tokens which he gave of his higher nature and lofty claims and faculties. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, corresponding with the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, is generally, in the Acts as well as in the LXX., associated with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, or "portents;" when it occurs in the synoptists it is translated "signs." The word by itself does not connote miraculous energies, but any event, natural or human, which becomes a token or witness to unseen or Divine energies. When Christ's wonderful actions (often called <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> by the synoptists) are referred to by John, he calls them simply <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>; so that operations which, if wrought by other persons, might have been portents, miracles, or marvels, are to him perfectly normal, and are called simply "works." Weiss leaves the question of the manner in which this supply of wine was provided entirely unsettled, but declares that, whether by some fortunate providential opportunity, by the forecast of the mother, or by concealed methods of meeting the exigency, this great gift was brought about by the Son of Mary, the effect was the same as if it had been wrought by the Creator's hand. The glory of his power and love and sympathy was manifested. This appears to us utterly inconsistent with the intention or idea of tim evangelist. The impression previously made upon John the Baptist was of his supreme submission to the Divine will, his sacrificial yielding to that will for the taking away of sin; further, that in some sense he was Son of God, and Minister and Organ for the dispensation of the Spirit of God. The few disciples admitted that, by his penetration of their character and hidden inner life, his <span class="accented">wisdom</span> was of a different kind from that of men. Now, however, they see a manifestation of his glory as <span class="accented">power.</span> He has unlimited resources at his disposal, <span class="cmt_word">and his disciples believed on him</span> to that extent. This expression asserts the truth of the selective and discriminating force of the mission of Christ, and the negative fact that the company assembled received no religious impression beyond the most superficial one. "The disciples" who came with him "believed" more than they had done before. It may be that they, especially John and Nathanael of Cana, were among the honorary <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> who were alone fully conscious of what happened on the occasion. They apprehend the "glory," and entirely trust themselves <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to him</span>, and follow him with an added momentum. There are new and wonderful suggestions made in this passage which unveil the glory of the Divine love and power now wrought in man. A point of connection with the synoptic Gospels is that they too record Christ's own description of the contrast between the austere prophet and the Son of man (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-18.htm">Matthew 11:18, 19</a>) in terms almost taken from this very scene. Compare also the mode in which Christ vindicated his own social freedom from Pharisaic exclusiveness, and the conduct of his own disciples from that of John the Baptist's disciples in the matter of ceremonial purifications, by his parable of the old wine skins bursting with the new and potent fluid put into them (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14-17</a> and parallel passages). John gives here a deeper apprehension of the mystery, a keynote to a whole cycle of instructions, on the "glory" of his love. By manifesting his Divine sympathy with marriage, with human life and fellowship, with innocent gladness, he proves himself to be the same Christ of whom the synoptic tradition speaks, the same Jesus who took the children to his arms, and constituted a "marriage supper" the great type of the eternal union between God and man in the gospel of his love (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2</a>, etc.). But this same evangelist is filled with the same imagery dating back to experiences of Cana, when he describes the final victory of the "Lamb of God" (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this he went down</span> - from the high lands of Galilee to the borders of the Sea of Galilee, depressed as we now know it to be below the level of the Mediterranean - <span class="cmt_word">to Capernaum</span>. Three competing sites for this small town have been advocated by Eastern travellers; all of them on the shore of the lake, all near to Bethsaida and Chorazin, in "the way of the sea," combining more or less the characteristics required by the New Testament narrative and the references in Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:10, 8). Keim is in favour of <span class="accented">Khan, Minyeh</span>; but there is no abundant spring such as Josephus describes, nor are there any ruins which indicate an extensive town. Caspari has argued in favour of <span class="accented">Ain Mudawarah</span>, a mile and a half to the west of <span class="accented">Khan Minyeh</span>, in which, though water is abundant, there are no remains of buildings. The old travellers, and the most recent explorations, have coincided in fixing on <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span> as the site; and Dr. Farrar, Dr. Westcott, Major Wilson, incline to this conclusion. Abundant ruins are found there, and, what is more than probable,  the remains of the very synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one certainly dating back to the Herodian age. <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span>, or "the Mound of Hum," is an easy corruption of the <span class="accented">Caphar</span>, or village of <span class="accented">Nahum. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples.</span> They may have returned home to Nazareth, though some recent commentators suggest that Cana had become the home of his family in late years. This is contradicted by the express statement of ch. 1:45, and the utter obliteration of the name of Cana from the synoptic narrative. We cannot identify this possible return to Nazareth with the account in <a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-20</a>, because it assumes a previous period of activity in Capernaum, and further, because the commencement of Christ's public ministry is expressly made synchronous with the imprisonment of the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-15</a>), which did not take place till weeks or months afterwards (<a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). Consequently, this journey to Capernaum preceded the journey to Jerusalem and the return to Nazareth, of which Matthew speaks. The fact that "the mother and brethren "of Jesus accompanied him, but not "the sisters," suggests what is implied in <a href="../../par/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a> that the sisters were married in Nazareth and in <a href="../../par/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21-23</a> that they did not accompany the non-believing brothers in their endeavour "to lay hold of him." The fact that Joseph is not mentioned induces the common assumption that he was already dead. Volumes have been written on "the brethren of Jesus." The determination of their parentage is one of the most perplexing points in the evangelic history. There are three hypotheses, which are alike beset with difficulties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The view propounded by Helvidius in Rome, in the fourth century, and to which Jerome replied, that the "brothers" are brothers in the ordinary sense, children of Joseph and Mary. This supposition is sustained by the statement of <a href="../../par/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>, each of which implies that the mother of our Lord had other children. The sentiment of the Church in favour of Mary's perpetual virginity, and in favour of the uniqueness of her maternity, has powerfully contested this supposition. Further, apart from any sentiment, it has been said that the Lord would not have commended the mother to the beloved disciple, if he had living brothers who had a previous claim. To this, however, it is replied that John, the son of Zebedee and Salome, may have been his near relative, if Salome were the sister of the Virgin; and also that, up to the time of the Ascension, there is no proof that the brethren believed in him, but the contrary. The effect of a special manifestation to James (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.) may have led to a general admission of the brethren, who are distinguished from, but yet <span class="accented">with</span>, the eleven apostles and the mother on the eve of the Ascension (<a href="../../par/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> To obviate the difficulties of a sentimental kind, it was suggested by Jerome, and it has been often assumed since, that these brothers were in reality <span class="accented">first cousins</span>, not the children of Salome the sister of the Virgin, but of Mary the wife of Cleophas, who is supposed to be the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus (see ch. 20:25, note), and further that this Cleophas   =   Clopas   =   <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>   =   Alphaeus   =   Chalphai for the Aramaic guttural might be omitted as in Alphseus, or turned into <span class="greek">&#x3ba;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c7;</span> in <span class="accented">Clopas</span>, found in John's text. Jerome, however (Lightfoot), never referred to this confirmation of his theory; but it has been hence conjectured that James the son of Alphaeus was identical with the celebrated "James the brother of our Lord," mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 12</a>; and in ecclesiastical history. If, however, this James were the "son of Alphaeus," then <span class="accented">Judas</span> (<a href="../../par/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>) (not Iscariot) - "Judas of James" (<a href="../../par/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 1:13) - was also one of the "brethren;" also Joses and Simon, sons of Cleophas, were of their number; and some have gone further, and made Simon the Canaanite the other brother. This might possibly be the solution of the puzzle, if the entire theory did not break down under the clear distinction drawn in evangelic narrative between the twelve apostles and the brethren. <span class="accented">E.g.</span> in this passage they are discriminated from "disciples." In <a href="../../par/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a> the "brethren" are said not to believe on the Lord. In <a href="../../par/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> they are mentioned in addition to the apostles. Though in <a href="../../par/galatians/1.htm">Galatians 1</a> and 2, James might seem from his great eminence to be classed with apostles in some wider sense, yet in <a href="../../par/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> he seems to take precedence of <span class="accented">all the</span> apostles, at the Council of Jerusalem, and in presidency of the Church there. Moreover, the identification of Cleophas with Alphaeus is very doubtful. Clopas is Aramaic, Cleophas a Greek name; and the identification of his wife Mary with the sister of the Virgin is also very doubtful; while to have two sisters of the same name in the same family is highly improbable. We cannot believe, further, that so distinguished a man as James the brother of our Lord could have been designated as "James the  Less" in the evangelic narrative (<a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>). If the "cousin theory" holds, this must have been the case. Finally, "cousins" would hardly so persistently have been spoken of as <span class="accented">brothers</span>, and this would be still less likely if their mother was living. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The third hypothesis, which is the suggestion of Epiphanius, is that these brothers were the children of Joseph by a previous marriage, to whom the blessed Virgin had acted the part of mother. This is based on a legend of the apocryphal 'Protevang. of James' (ch. 9. and 17.), where Joseph speaks of his "sons." The theory saves the virginity of Mary, but sacrifices that of Joseph. Such a conclusion, in some ecclesiastic circles, is almost as unwelcome as the former. Against Jerome's hypothesis the greatest number of difficulties present themselves, and it must be abandoned. Therefore the choice really lies between that of Helvidius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and that of Epiphauius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>. These are alike encumbered by the perplexity that among the twelve apostles there were two Jameses, two Judases, and two Simons; and among the "brethren" there must have been also a James, Judas, Joses, and Simon, with sisters. Moreover, there was a Joses or Joseph, who was son of Alphseus, and therefore a brother of James. This is not an insuperable difficulty, because of the frequency with which personal names recur in Oriental families. Whether this multiplicity be true or not, there are, at least, ten <span class="accented">other</span> Simons in the New Testament, and nearly as many Josephs or Joses; and Judas Barsabas (<a href="../../par/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>) must be discriminated from the two Judases here supposed. We must, however, choose between suppositions <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>. On the one side, it is said, if the brethren of Jesus were not the own sons of Mary, the language of Jesus on the cross would be entirely explicable. This is true; but, on the other side, if <span class="accented">John</span> were indeed a blood relation and beloved disciple (even if James was so also, but did not believe on him), the difficulty of the language is reduced to a minimum. There is no scriptural authority for the Epiphanian theory, but it is made plausible by the 'Gospel according to St. Peter' and the ' Protevang. Jacobi,' which refer to Joseph's sons. The whole history of its reception in the Church may be seen in the masterly essay of Bishop Lightfoot. The view of Alford, Mill, Farrar, Coder, and many others is in favour of a plain common sense interpretation of the letter of Scripture. Christ, who honoured marriage by his first display of miraculous power, and this at the suggestion of his own mother, and in the society of those who passed undoubtedly as his brothers, would not feel that the faintest shadow of a shade fell on the lofty purity of his mother by this hypothesis. Certainly the Evangelist Matthew had not a vestige in him of that adoration of virginity, or Mariolatry, which has led ecclesiastical historians and commentators to reject the Helvidian hypothesis. Godet and some other harmonists endeavour to find, during the residence in Capernaum, the occasion for the first miraculous draught of fishes, and the final call of the two pairs of brothers; but it is. excluded by the notes of time subsequently given. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-22.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The second sign Supremacy over the theocratic house. Illustrations of righteousness, reverence, power, and sacrificial ministry.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - They abode there not many days. And the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. The narrative at ver. 22; <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 27</a>, etc., shows, that some disciples were with him; but there is no reason for believing that the whole group were there. The fact is important that Jesus personally is said (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) to have gone up to Jerusalem, and that no reference is made to his disciples, mother, or brethren doing so. This undoubtedly assumes that he was not attended by any compact group of followers. It is more than probable that Simon and James, if not Nathanael and Philip, remained in Galilee to receive their final call in due season. One cannot doubt that John and Andrew were his auditors and witnesses. He went up to utter his prophetic summons to the metropolis of the nation, to take his place in the palace temple of his Father, in the centre of the old theocracy. After showing his perfect human sympathy, his power over physical nature, his abounding resources, and the glory of his love, he resolved that there should be no misunderstanding of his moral mission, and proceeded to institute a public demonstration of his loyalty to the theocracy, to the temple, and to its worship. Just at the moment when the One who, greater than the temple, was about to display his unique claims to a service which would outlive all the pomp of temple worship, it was profoundly significant that he should demand from it a right presentation, and not a corrupt defilement, of its true significance. Modern criticism refuses to accept the statements of the synoptists and of John as alike true, and endeavours to explain away one or the ether account. We are content to say here that a repetition of the Christ's claim to sanctify the temple was again made on the eve of that awful day when that blood should be shed which would exhaust all the significance of the hecatombs of victims slain in its precincts, and when the veil of the temple should be rent in twain. Weiss here shows that Baur and Hilgenfeld are inconsistent in repudiating the historical character  of an early conflict of Jesus with the authorities at Jerusalem, and that they forget, in their eagerness to demonstrate the anti-Jewish character of the Johannine Christ, that he here is represented as a pious Jew, attending the national festivals and jealous for the honour of the temple. The chronological difficulties that arise if the two cleansings are identified amount to the grossest inaccuracy on the part either of the synoptists or John. Lucke, De Wette, Ewald, treat the synoptists as inaccurate, and John's account, being that of an eyewitness, as the reduction of the event to its proper place in the history. It is obvious that the synoptists (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>) knew that words which John recounts had, at an earlier period, made a deep impression upon the multitude. The thief on the cross (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-38.htm">Matthew 27:38-44</a>), and the insulting crowds <a href="../../par/mark/15-27.htm">Mark 15:27-29</a>), and Stephen afterwards (<a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>), reveal familiarity with an utterance which John alone recounts, but which had been misunderstood. An ingenious writer in the <span class="accented">National Review</span>, 1857 (Mr. R.H. Hutton, "Theological Essays"), believes, not only that the entire scene in the temple, but that Christ's claim to be the Head of the kingdom, the parables of "wicked husbandmen" and "two sons," and the reference to the "baptism of John," should all be transferred, together with the triumphal entry, to the period in which John has placed the first temple cleansing. He thinks that the reference to the "baptism of John" was more reasonable at that period than two years after the death of John, and that (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-11.htm">Matthew 21:11</a>) the reference to "Jesus of Nazareth" was more appropriate at the beginning than at the close of the ministry. But, on the other hand, the inscription on the cross, "Jesus of Nazareth," and the numerous references to the "baptism of John" at a much later date, quite refute this argument. There are those who strenuously assail the historicity of St. John's account, and plead for the greater accuracy of the synoptists (Strauss, Baur, Hilgenfeld, etc.). But, seeing that the synoptic tradition takes no notice of this <span class="accented">preliminary</span> ministry, in which our Lord gives specimens of all his powers and glory, no reason presents itself why they should have singled out one narrative and misplaced it. So long as John's Gospel is held to have a genuine historicity, his narrative cannot be suffered to be a romantic transposition to meet a preconceived idea of chronological development. The early foreshadowing of the Lord's death and resurrection, coupled with the reference to Ms being "lifted up" like the serpent of brass, and the cruel treatment received from the people at Nazareth and from scribes and Pharisees at Capernaum, are in living harmony with one another, and combine to refute the idyllic reproduction of the public ministry, which Renan and many others have attempted to fashion, by which the early life is represented as enacted in one blaze of sunshine, and that its close alone was shrouded in clouds and darkened by the Lord's reckless and suicidal rushing on his fate. We therefore conclude, with numerous critics, that there is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> no reason to believe that John misplaced the temple cleansing; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he does not preclude the second act of the like kind recorded in the synoptists; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> while the synoptists imply occurrences which are detailed in John, but omitted in their narrative, yet the character of the proceeding differs on both occasions.

Within the latter was the sanctuary (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), or sacred <span class="accented">adytum</span>, where the altars of sacrifice and incense faced the veil of the holiest of all. In the court of the temple had been allowed a secular market for sacrificial beasts. An exchange for money was also set up,where Jews were ready to furnish, on usurious terms, the proper coin, the sacred half shekel (value, one shilling and threepence), in which form alone was the temple tax received from the provincial visitors or pilgrims from distant lands. No coin bearing the image of Caesar, or any foreign prince, or any idolatrous symbol then so common, would be allowed in the sacred treasury. So the Lord found those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the exchangers of money sitting; a busy bazaar, deteriorating the idea of the temple with adverse associations. The three sacrificial animals mentioned were those most frequently required. The strangers, doubtless, needed some market where these could be obtained, and where the sufficient guarantee of their freedom from blemish could be secured. It was also indispensable that exchange of coins should have been made feasible for the host of strangers. The profanation effected by transacting these measures in the temple courts was symptomatic of widespread secularism, an outward indication of the corruption of the entire idea of worship, and of the selfishness and pride which had vitiated the solemnity and spirituality of the sacrificial ritual. Geikie has given a very brilliant description of this scene; so also Edersheim, 'Life of Jesus the Messiah.' The money (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) was probably derived from a word (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>) meaning "to cut," and referred to the minute coins which were required for convenient exchange. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which gives its name to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> of the following verse, is also the name of a  small (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "mutilated") coin used for purposes of exchange. The smaller the coin the better, as the minute differences of weight of the foreign coins would thus be more easily measured.

This feature of the Lord's action was not repeated at the close of the ministry. Observe that John singles out this punitive element in the first public appearance of the Lord for especial notice, and adds it to the otherwise resistless force which he was accustomed to wield by the glance of his eye or the tones of his voice. The "scourge," as Godet says, is a symbol, not an instrument. It was in Christ's hands a conspicuous method of expressing his indignation, and augmenting the force of his command, by an indication that he meant to be obeyed there and then. <span class="cmt_word">He drove them all out of the temple court</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, the intrusive sellers of the sacrificial beasts, the herdsmen, and traffickers. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the sheep and the oxen,</span> which moved at once in a vast group, turning, fleeing to the great exits; and <span class="cmt_word">he poured out</span> on the ground, and with his own hand, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">coins</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the exchangers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), and overthrew the tables. "Christ had," as Hengstenberg says, "a powerful confederate in the consciences of the offenders." The presentiment of coming revolution and overthrow aided the impression produced by that majestic countenance and commanding glance, manner, and voice, that so often made men feel that they were utterly and absolutely in his power (cf. <a href="../../par/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a>, note).

Some sentimental comments have gathered round this verse, as though the Lord were more tender in his treatment of the turtle doves than in that of the oxen or sheep. But there would be no meaning in such a distinction. No other way of scattering the doves was so simple as to command their removal. At "the Ammergan Passion play," the doves are let loose, fly away over the heads of the audience, and disappear. The lifting of the scourge, accompanied, doubtless, with words of solemn warning and command, said in effect what he now put into words. <span class="cmt_word">Take these things hence. Make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise</span>. In this act our Lord simply assumed the <span class="accented">role</span> of any and every Hebrew prophet. The Talmud enjoins the sanctity for which the Saviour pleads. He called the temple "my Father's house" (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>), and therefore claims especially to be the Son of God Most High. The Eternal, the Holy One of Israel, stands in this mysterious relationship to him. He does not say, "our Father's house." When, however, alter the second cleansing of the temple, he spake of the temple, from which he finally withdrew (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>), he called it by no other name than "your house," "left unto you desolate." Moreover, on that subsequent occasion, he used, in place of "house of merchandise," the bitter description, "den of robbers" (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>). This first act was reformatory of a gross abuse; the latter was judicial and condemnatory (see Hengstenberg, 'Christology' and 'Comm.,' <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). Archdeacon Watkins has wisely called attention to the contrast between this scene and sign and that given at Cana. Here we see how true it was that his hour had not yet come.

The future tense, affirmed by the best manuscripts, never (Meyer) bears the present meaning. The disciples, familiar with the Old Testament, remembered at the time the words of <a href="../../par/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>. In that psalm the theocratic Sufferer approached the climax of his sorrows, and admitted that a holy zeal for God's house will ultimately consume him - eat him up. Tile word is used for consuming emotions (cf. Aristoph., 'Vespae,' 287), and there is a foreshadowing of the reproach and agony which will befall the righteous Servant of God in his passion for God's honour. The parallelism of the second clause of the verse, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me," confirm the application, though the words are not cited. Several other citations are made in the New Testament from this psalm, which, whether it be Messianic in the oracular sense or not, is dearly one that furnished the mind of the early Church with abundant illustration of the suffering of the Christ (<a href="../../par/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a> with the narrative of the Crucifixion). Thoma labours to find in the Old Testament prophecies generally the true source of the Johannine narrative.

John, at least, saw the rising storm of enmity already hurtling, but says nothing. Nevertheless, as if in reply to the imperial prophetic act (which corresponded with John the Baptist's prediction of One who would come axe in hand), the Jews approached with answer (of., for this use of the word "answer," <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/11-14.htm">Mark 11:14</a>). The "answer" here is in the form of a question, which shows that they had not recognized the sign he had already given, that this temple was his "Father's house," and that he had solemnly claimed the authority of "Son" over the house. <span class="cmt_word">What sign showest thou, because</span> (or, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thou doest these things?</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/john/6-30.htm">John 6:30</a>). Thou art bound to give us some "sign" that thou hast a right to deal thus with established customs and to assume the position of a public reformer. Upon what does thine (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) authority rest? Give us some miraculous proof of these high assumptions, "seeing that (<span class="accented">quatenus</span>) thou art doing these things," whose consequences are now so conspicuous. It might be supposed that the extraordinary effect just produced upon the crowd of traffickers was sufficient proof of power, if not of authority. The Jews were within their right in asking for these authentications; but their continuous demand for outward signs is one of the conspicuous features of their character (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>). In the fundamental nature of a "sign" there is a hint of the true solution of the enigmatical saying which is the first public utterance of our Lord. He gave to the act which he was about to perform the characteristic of a "sign." It would be an outward and visible manifestation of a stupendous spiritual event. This, among other reasons, refutes the modern speculation of Herder, Ewald, Lucke, Renan, and even of Neander, Geikie, and others, that the evangelist was wrong in the explanation of this remarkable saying which he offered in the twenty-first verse. John, who, better than modern commentators can do, ought to have known what the Lord meant, declares that Jesus was speaking of "the temple of his body" when, as the context shows, he was vindicating his right to cleanse the existing temple; and by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "this sanctuary," he was also pointing to and referring in some sense to the temple structure in the midst of which he and the Jews were standing. The commentators have said, "John was wrong, and was led astray by his own fancies. There was no reference to the death or resurrection of Christ. The Lord meant," say they, "as follows: 'Persist in your lawless, irreverent, unbelieving treatment of the temple, and so destroy it. Let it cease by this handling of yours from being a temple, and I will prove my right to cleanse it, and to reform, rebuke, or condemn your immoral practices in it, by building it again, or rather erecting a spiritual temple, a temple without hands, and in three days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a short time after you have consummated your impiety, I will complete my restorative work - I will build a new temple and fill it with my glory.'" If John had not appended the twenty-first verse, "Howbeit he spake concerning the temple of his body," the above interpretation would deserve very close attention and perhaps acceptance. But there are sundry difficulties in it, even if the evangelist had not supplied the true key: - <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Christ does not say, "I will raise up 'another' temple or a 'spiritual' temple on the ruins of the old;" but "I will raise <span class="accented">it</span> up," viz. the temple which I challenge you to "destroy." Though <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in three days," is used in this indefinite sense, in Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, LXX.), yet it is the accepted term for the period of three days, which counted from the death to the resurrection of the Lord, and which in the synoptic Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>) is distinctly foretold to be the great "sign" given to that generation. Moreover, from the Jewish misunderstanding of the words which appear in the synoptic narrative, viz. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "during three days," the literal character of the time specified had laid hold, not only of the disciples, but of the multitude. Again, the erection of the spiritual temple would not be an <span class="accented">outward and visible sign</span> of the grace and authority of the Lord; but rather the great spiritual reality itself - invisible indeed, and requiring signs to manliest and demonstrate its own occurrence and existence. We conclude, then, that the apostle knew better than his critics, and that we are to believe that, when the Lord said to the Jews, <span class="cmt_word">Destroy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, dissolve, break up) <span class="cmt_word">this temple</span>, "he was speaking of the temple of his body," and at the same time linking and identifying the two temples, relating the one to the other so closely that the destruction of his body became <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> the demolition of the temple character of the building where they then stood. The temple of stone and gold, of stately decoration and ceremonial, derived all its true meaning from its being the gorgeous crystallization of a Divine idea embodied in his life. The temple had no value save as a meeting place for God and man, where by sacrifice and worship man might approach the Father, who declared himself to be reconciled, long suffering, and yet just. The Lord has come to the temple, but was himself  One holier and "greater than the temple." <span class="accented">God</span> is manifested in the glory of that holy life, and man is set forth also in Christ's perfect high-priestly approach to and commerce with the excellent glory. The Lord knows that he is the Lamb, and the only begotten Son of God, and he knows also that his death is part of the awful method in which the vast designs of his righteous love will be secured. He has a baptism to be baptized with, and he is straitened until it be accomplished. He anticipates the end. As he said afterwards to Judas, "That thou doest do quickly;" so at this moment he said, <span class="cmt_word">Destroy this temple</span> (of my body), and you will destroy therein the temple character of this historic embodiment of a grand prophetic hope; and <span class="cmt_word">I will raise it up,</span> viz. - the temple of my body - <span class="cmt_word">in three days</span> (not, I will raise it by quiet, unobserved, spirit processes in the souls of men, but) the very temple which you will bring down shall henceforth be the living and eternal temple of all the glory of God and all the possibilities of man. The great bulk of expositors of many types, who do not repudiate St. John's own words, see thus (with more or less of a double reference in it) the first main significance of the enigma. Whether our Lord pointed to his own Person as he uttered these words cannot be determined. It is said by some - If he had done so, all ambiguity would have been removed, and the misunderstanding which followed would have been impossible! Surely the Jews were not usually ready to receive parabolic truth of this kind so readily, and after their fashion were almost sure to misconceive and falsely to misrepresent it. Even the disciples did not see into its meaning until after the Resurrection (ver. 22). How could they? Verily, then, and not till then, was it seen that the sign of the Prophet Jonas had been given to that generation.

This is one of the most important chronological data for the life of our Lord. Herod the Great, according to Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11 1), commenced the rebuilding of the second temple in the autumn of the eighteenth year of his reign. We find that his first year reckoned from Nisan, A.U.C. 717-718. Consequently, the eighteenth year must have commenced between Nisan, A.U.C. 734-735 and 735-736. The forty-sixth year after this would make the. Passover at which this speech was delivered - the spring of A.U.C. 781 (Wieseler, 'Chronicles Synopsis of the Four Gospels,' translation; and Herzog, 'Encyc.,' 21:546. The fact that Josephus, in his 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:21, gives the fifteenth year of Herod's reign instead of the eighteenth, is shown by Wieseler to be an error of the transcriber, see p. 152, note), which, if we compare with the other hints, is a fixed point from which to reckon the birth year and death year of our Lord. The "about thirty years old" of the Lord at his baptism throws us to about A.U.C. 751,  <span class="date">B.C. 2</span>, for the year of his birth, and <span class="accented">if</span> there be only one Passover mentioned in John's Gospel between this and the last Passover, it gives A.U.C. 783 for the year of his death. This date is at least coincident with the date derived from the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, as that of the commencement of the mission of John (see my examination of these dates in appendix to 'John the Baptist'). The temple which Herod began to repair in the eighteenth year of his reign was not completed until A.D. , under Herod Agrippa II., a very short period before its utter destruction. The irony and scorn are manifest: <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou raise it up in three days?</span> John shows, in ver. 21, that, in the deep sense in which our Lord used the words, he abundantly justified his promise. <span class="cmt_word">But he</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Lord, not the people, not the disciples - <span class="cmt_word">spake of the temple of his body.</span> This is the reflection which was made upon the word of Jesus by the evangelists in after days. Even Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>) reveals the presence of a spiritual interpretation of the words by some of his unsympathetic listeners. It must not be forgotten that, in the synoptists, we find the presence of the idea that his service was a temple service, and that he was greater than the temple (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; with Ephesians 2:19-22). Nor must it be forgotten that the Logos itself was, in the figurative language of Philo, spoken of as the house, or temple, of God. Later rabbinical representations also describe "the body of man as the temple in which the Shechinah operates" (Wunsche). A difficulty arises from the Lord's having claimed in these words to be on the point of raising himself from the dead, whereas elsewhere his resurrection is referred to the mighty power of God, as in ver. 22; <a href="../../par/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, etc. Without doubt, God and the Father, the Supreme Power, was thus seen in living activity; but the Divine nature of Christ not infrequently so steps forward into his  <span class="accented">consciousness</span> that he can say, "I and the Father are one;" and (ch. 10:17, 18) "I will lay down my life that I may take it again" (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8-10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a></div><div class="verse">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this</span> (to them), <span class="cmt_word">and believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus said.</span> This frequent contrast instituted by the apostle between the first impression produced on the disciples (himself among them) and that which was produced by subsequent reflection after the resurrection of Jesus and gift of the Spirit, becomes a powerful mark of authenticity (compare the passages which Godet has here cited, <a href="../../par/john/4-32.htm">John 4:32, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-12.htm">John 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-28.htm">John 13:28</a>; with many others). "A pseudo-John imagining, in the second century, this ignorance of the apostle in regard to a saying which he had invented himself, is 'criticism' dashing itself against moral impossibility." These quiet "asides" and reflections of the biographer on the mistaken ideas which he cites and corrects, are of consummate value, as pointing out the stages by which the most stupendous ideas that have taken human spirits captive dawned on the most susceptible minds. The "Word" and the "Scripture" helped the disciples to subsequent faith. Why is "Scripture" in the singular, seeing that John used this form of expression ten times when he had one definite passage of Scripture in his mind, and used the plural when the general authority of Scripture was appealed to? Many have looked to one or another definite Scripture text supposed to predict the resurrection of Christ, such as <a href="../../par/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> (some, very wrongly, to <a href="../../par/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, where no reference can be established to this great event). Dr. Moulton points back to <a href="../../par/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, and the impression which the Lord's "zeal" had produced on the disciples. It seems better to recall Christ's own words, and the comment of Luke, in Luke 24:25-27, where the whole Scripture seems to have been laid under contribution to establish the grand expectation. Further, of <a href="../../par/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>, where John, referring to the same subject, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> in the singular, for the general tendency of Scripture. All the passages which couple suffering and apparent defeat with triumph and victory, did prepare the mind of thoughtful men for the better understanding of the Resurrection. Thus <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. and the closing words of <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; and <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> thereupon come into view; and, in fact, all the Scriptures which anticipate the glorious reign and victory of the Christ and the extension of his kingdom, when coupled with those which portrayed the sorrows of Messiah and of the ideal Sufferer, implicitly convey the same thought. Consequently, numerous passages in Isaiah, Micah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, with <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and Psalms 72, 45, etc., taken in connection with prediction of the sorrows of Messiah, did prepare the disciples to believe that the Holy One could not be holden by the pangs of death (<a href="../../par/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, etc.). Before closing this paragraph, we must notice that, in this entire transaction, the Lord is not separating himself from the existing theocracy, but interpreting its highest meaning. In the cleansing of the temple at the last he was judging and condemning. The vindication by our Lord of his own action was very different on the latter occasion from what it is here (cf. <a href="../../par/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a> with <a href="../../par/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>), and numerous other accompaniments are profoundly different; nor did he then speak of the destruction of the temple, although, as we have seen, much exaggerated and mis-apprehensive talk concerning him had been floating among the people (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <i>day</i>, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23-ch. 3:2.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Numerous signs in Jerusalem, with their twofold effects.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - A new paragraph is commenced here. The conversation with Nicodemus is prefaced by a very remarkable summary of facts, and a hint of principles of action, which are intended to throw light on the great discourse, which hears the same kind of relation to St. John's Gospel that the sermon on the mount does to St. Matthew's Gospel. It is a compendium of the Christian faith. The very fulness and sufficiency of it suggests the doubt of its authenticity. Is not the Lord's reticence on other occasions, and even his enigmatic, parabolic methods of teaching, in decided contrast with the abundance of the revelations with which Nicodemus was favoured? We are tempted to ask - What was the evangelist's source of information? The only reply that seems to me rational is that John himself was the auditor of this discourse, and has preserved it for the edification and solace of the world. The disciple whom Jesus loved never left him, but was perpetually drinking in his words, and, with a genuine Hebrew retentiveness, preserved them intact; at all events, he so reproduced the leading ideas of the conversation. This is, we maintain, a far more scientific treatment of the authorities than the hypothesis of a Johannist of the second century having gathered up and idealized the synoptic records of the scribes, who, by sundry questions, brought forth from the Lord some of his most characteristic teaching. Thoma urges that we have here a  spiritual <span class="accented">rechauffe</span> of "the rich young man," of "the lawyer," and of the story of Paul, himself a Pharisee, when finally convinced that he needed a new creation and a spiritual life! First of all, then, we have the place, general period, and specific time referred to: <span class="cmt_word">Now when he was in Jerusalem</span> - not the temple, but in the houses and streets, and perhaps suburbs, of Jerusalem (<span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the plural form used generally in the Gospel, while <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span> is used in the Revelation in symbolic sense) - <span class="cmt_word">at the Passover</span>; a period generally covering nine or ten days of celebration, extending from the first purifying of the houses from all leaven and the drawing of pure water on the thirteenth Nisan, the paschal meal on the fourteenth Nisan, the feasts in the evenings of the great days of convocation, fifteenth and twenty-first of the month, and the ceremonies of the intervening six days. <span class="cmt_word">In the feast</span> must refer to one or ether of the great days of convocation, worship, and feasting. <span class="cmt_word">Many believed on his Name;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on his Messiahship, rather than on himself, as their Prophet, Purifier, self-sacrificing Priest, or than on himself as Lamb of God or Son of God. They accepted on easy terms, with a fickle and perhaps eager fanaticism, the first impression produced by him <span class="cmt_word">when they saw the signs which he was making</span> of his heavenly mission and nature. We must conclude, therefore, that he did in many ways partially unveil himself. Nicodemus heard of these "signs," and referred them to a Divine commission. John does not here, nor elsewhere, say what these signs were - whether they consisted of effects produced on nature or on men, whether they were deeds of healing, or of moral compulsion, or repression, or reformation. Great expectations with reference to a coming Christ had been excited in the breasts of tens of thousands by John the Baptist's fiery ministry. The result was that men now flocked to Jesus in greater numbers than they had done to him (<a href="../../par/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>). The faith that they exercised was neither deep nor appreciative, yet it was worthy of the name of faith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24</a></div><div class="verse">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <i>men</i>,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus did not</span> (imperfect) <span class="cmt_word">trust himself to them;</span> not even to those who had "trusted on his Name." This remarkable expression corresponds with many actions and methods of Jesus. When he was offered the homage of devils, he forbade them to speak. When those who had been simply healed of bodily disease began garrulously to proclaim his praises, he silenced them. He had no faith in their faith, and consequently did not open to them more of his nature; still less did he assume, as they would have liked him to do, an immediate and outward Messiahship of political revolt. He did not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax, and often made use of the smallest remnant of spiritual apprehension; but even in Galilee, when they would by force have made him a king, "he sent the multitudes away." The apparently arbitrary permission given to others to proclaim his Name (as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to the healed demoniac of Gergesa, <a href="../../par/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>; cf. Luke 9:57-62) suggests the precise inquiry which John had felt from the first Jerusalem visit, and which, with profound insight, he thus meets: "He did not trust himself to them," <span class="cmt_word">owing to the fact that he knew</span> - (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by apperceptive and continuous processes) - <span class="cmt_word">all</span> (<span class="accented">men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>persons</span>. He penetrated their thoughts, discerned their character, saw the meaning of their faith, the burden of their wishes, the regal passions that consumed them - he knew all. <span class="cmt_word">And also because he had no need that any should testify what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man; for he himself</span> - without such aid - <span class="cmt_word">knew what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man</span>. The definite articles here may either restrict the meaning to the men who happened one by one to come under his searching glance (<a href="../../par/john/7-51.htm">John 7:51</a>; Meyer), or it may mean "man" generically, "human nature" in all its peril, weakness, and self-deception. Geikie ('Life of Christ,' 1, 508) gives a novel, though entirely indefensible, translation: "He needed not that any should bear witness respecting him as man." The better and more accurate translation is the first; but since his glance is universal and contact with souls continuous - man by man - the statement thus embraces even <span class="accented">more than is</span> involved in the generic sense. The knowledge of man (<span class="accented">homo</span>) "generically" would not embrace his individualities - would leave out the specialities of each case. The particularism of Christ's penetrative glance gives the stronger and better explanation of the reserve of Christ in dealing with these half-believers, than the generic or rather universal knowledge which is supposed to be involved. N.B. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is a so called faith to which Christ will <span class="accented">not</span> unveil himself - will not give himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The great reward of faith in Christ is the faith <span class="accented">of</span> Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Faith in the Name of Christ, produced now by "signs," real or artificial, fictitious or sacramental, mystic, or miraculous, or aesthetic, by <span class="accented">series Biblicae</span>, or exaggerated ideas of special providence, is not comparable to the faith in Christ himself, which the truth about him excites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is to the latter rather than to the former that the golden gates of the heart of Jesus are opened.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Is this narrative introduced, as Baur thinks, to give a specimen of wrongly directed faith, to which Christ did <span class="accented">not</span> entrust himself? and was the evangelist busy at once on his great mission of undervaluing the Jewish parties and nation? Certainly not. We have a clear proof that, in the case of the genuine inquirer, Christ did open His very heart; and to a "ruler of Jews," to a "Pharisee," to a "teacher of Israel," he deigned (because he knew what was in the man, and required nobody's help) to unveil the deepest realities of the kingdom of God and of the salvation of man. Baur is not correct in making Nicodemus out to be a specimen of unbelieving Judaism and unsusceptible Pharisaism, seeing that the later notices of this Sanhedrist show that he became a disciple of Jesus, if secretly, Nicodemus was attracted, as others had been, by the "signs" which Jesus had wrought; but he had gone further and deeper than they, and Jesus "knew it." A controversy has arisen on the point - Did our Lord, by these penetrative glances, manifest his Divine nature, assume a Divine prerogative, or exercise a lofty, penetrative human gift? Westcott, on the philological ground of the contrast in meaning between <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, urges that the former word, used here, represents knowledge acquired by processes of inquiry and perception, as distinct from the latter, which is reserved for absolute and settled knowledge. Godet, on theological grounds, urges that the phrase refers to the human faculty of observation rather than to the Divine prerogative of heart-searching. There are, however, many other indications of this same thought-mastery, which the evangelists appear to regard as proofs of Divine power; so that I think the real significance of the passage is an ascription to Jesus of Divine power. The supernatural in mind, the superhuman mental processes of Jesus, are part of the proof we have that, though he was Man, he created the irresistible impression that he was more than man. Thus Nathanael and Thomas found these to be the most irresistible proofs of the supreme Divine perfections of their Master (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-61.htm">John 6:61</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-11.htm">John 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>; and also <a href="../../par/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2, 9, 13</a>, etc.). "The man of the Pharisees" furnishes (Godet) a test for determining the authenticity of the narrative. If the lines of the following discourse, which move from the first fundamental conditions of admission into the kingdom of God to the deepest principles of Divine character, and the grounds and consequences of reconciliation with God, are such as meet the standpoint and correct the deductions of the Pharisee, we have, then, all but demonstrative evidence that this conversation did not evolve itself out of the consciousness of the second century. The Pharisaic party was excited by the ministry of John (ch. John 1:24), and throughout the early ministry of Jesus in Galilee followed him, with suspicious, malicious suggestions, even plans for his suppression. The name <span class="cmt_word">Nicodemus</span>, if Hebrew in etymology from <span class="accented">dam</span> and <span class="accented">naki</span>, may have meant "innocent blood;" it Greek, as is more probable, seeing that the plan of bearing Greek as well as Hebrew names was not uncommon, it would signify "Conqueror of the people." Tradition says that he was baptized by Peter and John, and deposed from his position in the Sanhedrin, but supported by his kinsman, Gamaliel. Each reference to him (<a href="../../par/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50</a> and John 19:39) implies a certain timidity, and perhaps unworthy reticence. These are relative terms. Much moral courage must have been required for <span class="cmt_word">a ruler</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the</span> Jews (a phrase only applicable to a man of high ecclesiastical rank) to have dreamed of doing what he is reported to have done here and elsewhere. The Talmud mentions a Nicodemus ben Gotten, who was also called Bonai, a disciple of Jesus, of great wealth and piety, who survived the destruction of Jerusalem, and therein lost nil his fortune (Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>; Delitzsch, 'Zeitsch. Luth. Theol.,' 1854). The hint that he was an old man in this year (A.U.C. 781, or A.D. ) renders his survival till A.D.  improbable, but not impossible by any means. The identification is not complete. The Talmud does not speak of him as a Sanhedrist, though it gives curious details, which imply that he must have been a priest in the temple, and had the charge of providing the water supply for the pilgrims (Geikie, 1:584; Winer, 'Real.,' 2:152). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This man came to him</span> <span class="cmt_word">by night,</span>  <span class="cmt_word">and said unto him.</span> To suppose, with many commentators (after Augustine), that the <span class="accented">night</span> is here symbolic of the mental condition of the man, is far-fetched. Thoma, here intent on his principle of the fabricated character of the Gospel, compares this to King Saul (Paul's ancestor!) going by night to Samuel - a type of Christ! There is more probability that the night of the Last Supper was in the mind of John, and that these two nights, the one at the beginning, the other at the close of the ministry of Jesus - nights of extraordinary significance - were impressed ineffaceably on his memory, and, to some extent, contrasted with each other. Nicodemus did not fear the Lord or his disciples, but his own colleagues, whose excitement had already betrayed their sentiments. Without "believing on his Name," they had come to some conclusions, and Nicodemus with them. <span class="cmt_word">Rabbi</span>, said he, <span class="cmt_word">we know.</span> He does not conceal a common sentiment at that moment agitating his own class in society, and he bestows the honorific title of Rabbi, "my Master," which, as coming from a learned doctor to a humble peasant, was a remarkable testimony to the effect Jesus had indirectly exerted beyond the circle of his immediate hearers: that thou art a Teacher come from God. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, precedes "the Teacher come." Certainly it yields to Jesus great dignity. He is God-sent, like the prophets of old. He has a right to teach. His doctorate is a heavenly diploma; and Nicodemus draws a wiser conclusion than the many did who, in some sense, believed on his Name. They were rushing heedlessly forward to further conclusions. Nicodemus saw a grand authority as a Teacher of men, a Heaven-sent Messenger, in the Lord Jesus, and he came to this conclusion from the settled persuasion that no man can do the signs which thou art performing, if God be not with him. This confession was true, indicating candid and honest inquiry and a teachable mind. It was the very truth which Peter in subsequent times gave to Cornelius as explanation of the healing and beneficent powers of Jesus. Christ knew the whole man, understood at once the honesty of the inquiry, and did entrust himself to Nicodemus. There was more faith in this modest inquiry, in this honest scepticism of his own position, than in the clamours and hosannas of the fickle crowd.

New birth of the Spirit.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Many explanations have been offered of the link of connection between the suggestion of Nicodemus and the reply of Jesus. Many expansions or additions have been conjectured, such as the following, suggested by Christ's own language elsewhere: "You, by the finger of God, are casting out devils; then the kingdom of God has come nigh unto us. How may we enter upon its further proofs?" - a view which would demand a deeper knowledge of the mind of Christ than we have any reason to suppose diffused at this period. Others (Baumlein) have supposed Nicodemus to have said, "Does the baptism of John suffice for admission into the kingdom?" - a suggestion which would be most strange for a Pharisaic Sanhedrist to have extemporized. At the same time, it may be proved that the rabbis regarded proselytism as a "new birth," and one produced or brought about by circumcision and baptism (Wunsche, <span class="accented">l.c.</span> 506; Geikie, 1:505). Others, again, have put further words into the reply of Jesus, such as, "The kingdom of God is not in the miracles which I am working; it is in a state of things which can only be appreciated by a radical spiritual change" (Lucke). Similarly Luthardt. Nicodemus was thinking of the kingdom of God evinced by miraculous signs; and Jesus points him to the inner reality rather than to the outer manifestation. Godet sees the Pharisaic position in the question of Nicodemus, "Art thou the Messiah? is the kingdom of God near, as thy miracles seem to indicate?" He was assuming that, as a Pharisee, he had nothing to do but walk in the light, the dawn of which was revealed to him in the signs of a divinely sent Teacher. All these views embrace a large amount of possible conjectural truth; but they ignore the play upon the words of Nicodemus, which the answer of Jesus involves, showing that a sharp, clean retort followed the speech of the former. "<span class="accented">We know that</span> NO MAN IS ABLE <span class="accented">to do these signs which thou art working</span> EXCEPT GOD, BE WITH HIM. <span class="accented">Verily, verily, I say unto thee</span>, EXCEPT ONE <span class="accented">be born anew</span>, HE IS NOT ABLE <span class="accented">to see the kingdom of God."</span> The form of both protasis and apodosis in each sentence closely corresponds, and this correspondence suggests the fact of an immediate repartee. adopting even the form of the question or assertion of the ruler of the Jews. To the "we know" of Nicodemus, comes the "I say unto thee" of Jesus. To the general sentiment of Nicodemus Christ gives a personal application. In place of speculation concerning his own relation to God and to the kingdom, Christ searches in the heart of his questioner for spiritual susceptibility. Over against the general proposition about God being with the Worker of these signs Christ sets the practical truth and Divine possibility of any man seeing the kingdom of God. To the suspicion of Jesus being the Messenger and Minister of God, he opposes the supposition of being born from heaven, or anew. From ancient times commentators have been divided as to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> - whether it should be rendered "from above" or "anew," "<span class="accented">again."</span> The first was favoured by Origen and many others down to Bengel, Lucke, Meyer, Baur, Wordsworth, Lange, based on the local meaning of the word in numerous places; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "from the top" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), "from heaven above" (<a href="../../par/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>). Moreover, John uses the idea of birth <span class="accented">from God</span>, or by <span class="accented">his will</span> supervening on the life of man, and the consequent conference upon it of a new beginning (<a href="../../par/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1, 4, 18</a>). The great point on which our Lord insists is the Divine spiritual origin of the life of which he has so much to say. Several of the English versions, Coverdale's - and second edition of the Bishops' Bible - have adopted this rendering, with the Armenian and Gothic Versions. The Revised Version has placed it in the margin. Against it is to be brought the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 23</a>, and in Justin, 'Apol.,' 1:6l) - a word which corresponds with this clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and yet could scarcely be translated "to be born from above," but, "to be born again." The second rendering, giving a temporal value to <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, was adopted by Augustine, Chrysostom (who uses both views), the Vulgate, Luther, Calvin, Tholuck, Godet, Westcott, Moulton, Weiss, and Luthardt, and is sustained by the fact that Nicodemus was led by it to an inquiry about (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) a second birth. If the expression had had no ambiguity about it, and merely conveyed the idea of a heavenly birth, his mistake would have been greater than it was. There are, moreover, numerous passages confirming the temporal sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (Wettstein and Grimm both quote from Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:18. 3; and Artemidorus, 'Oneiroc.,' 1:13); and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a> points in the same direction. The Jewish rabbi ought to have been familiar with the idea of the "new heart" and "right spirit," and the marvellous and mighty change wrought in men by the Holy Spirit; but the spiritual idea had been overlaid by rabbinic ritualism, and all the hopeless entanglements of ceremonial purity which had been reacts to do duty for spiritual conformity with the Divine will. Archdeacon Watkins reminds us that the Syriac Version here gives the rendering "from the beginning," or "anew," and lays great stress on this solution of the ambiguity in the Greek word. The statement of Christ is very remarkable. A man must be born anew, must undergo a radical change, even to <span class="accented">see the kingdom of God</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). The true kingdom is not a Divine government of outward, visible magnificence, sustained by miraculous aid - a physical sovereignty which shall rival and eclipse the majesty of Caesar. When the kingdom shall come in its genuine power, the carnal eye will not discover its presence. The man born anew will alone be able to appreciate it. The Jews boasted that they were born of God (<a href="../../par/john/8-41.htm">John 8:41</a>), but could not understand that they needed vital, fundamental, moral renewal - a second birth, a new beginning. Let the opening of Christ's Galilaean ministry be compared with this bold utterance. There in public discourse he called upon all men everywhere to "repent," to undergo a radical change of mind, and that because the kingdom of heaven was at hand. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> portrays the same change as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; but one term denotes thai; change as a human experience and effort, the other as a Divine operation. Neither repentance nor regeneration commended itself to the rabbinic mind as a necessity for one who was exalted by privilege and ennobled by obedience. The phrase, "kingdom of God," is not a mode of representing truth to which this Gospel calls frequent attention. Still our Lord to Pilate (<a href="../../par/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>) admits that he is himself the Head of kingdom which is "not from hence" - not resting on this world as its foundation or source. In Matthew the whole of the mission of Christ among men is repeatedly portrayed as "the kingdom of heaven." And from the time when the Lord ascended until now, various efforts have been made to realize, to discover, to embody, to emblazon, to crush, to ignore, that kingdom and its King. This great utterance is a key to much of the history of the Church, and an explanation of its numberless mistakes. Moreover, it supplies an invaluable hint of the true nature of the kingdom of God. Thoma insists on the other rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, and compares it with the Philonic doctrine, "that the substance of the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is not attributed to that which is created, but is breathed into the flesh from above (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by God.... Aim, O soul, at the bodiless essence of the spirit world as thy inheritance." These ideas, he thinks, John has placed into the lips of Jesus. The two classes of ideas are fundamentally distinct. Philo contrasts the sensuous and the intellectual; Christ is contrasting nature and grace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nicodemus saith</span> <span class="cmt_word">to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</span> The numerous endeavours to  interpret the motive or mind of Nicodemus show almost as much misunderstanding of the <span class="accented">naivete</span> of his amazement, as Nicodemus did of the deepest significance of this solemn utterance of the Lord. Two things are perfectly clear: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Nicodemus saw a grave and amazing difficulty in the idea of a second birth of a man old, like himself, in years, prepossessions, habits of thought, ways of acting, social ties, ancestral and traditional customs, and in venerable ideas consecrated by long usage. He might have known the language of the prophets concerning circumcision of heart (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>) and concerning a <span class="accented">new heart</span> and right spirit (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/86-4.htm">Psalm 86:4</a>); but the full bearing of these prophetic ideas were beyond and different to the almost drastic form of Christ's call for spiritual change and "birth from the beginning." There is no necessity for us to accuse him either of "narrowness" (Meyer) or of imbecility (Reuss, Lucke), or to make such a charge react upon the spirit or temper of the evangelist in delineating him. It is enough that Nicodemus should have seen a grave difficulty; and Thoma here is justified in referring to the language of the apostles, when the narrow entrance into the kingdom was set forth under the image of the camel and the needle's eye; and to Mary, when she cried, "How can this thing be?" Moreover, the same perplexity, after eighteen hundred years of Christian experience, still encumbers this utterance of the Master. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Nicodemus did not, by the form of his question, put such query to the Lord in any literal baldness or insolent worldliness. Surely such a view ignores all the tropical methods of speech current in the rabbinical schools. He virtually said," Birth such as you speak of is as impossible as the second physical birth of an old man, as preposterous as would be re-entrance into the womb of his mother for the purpose of a second birth." Christ had spoken of a fundamental change - one going right down to the very sources and beginnings of life. The Lord had used this difficult image, and propounded his view in a term capable of various interpretation. Nicodemus simply expresses his alarm and incredulity in terms of the image itself. It is little more than the language of the prophet, "Can an Ethiopian change his skin, or a leopard his spots?" Are you not proposing a natural impessibility? Must not the kingdom of God, which we thought we saw in thy advent and mighty deeds, be on this understanding hopelessly veiled from human vision? The "being old" shows that Nicodemus had gone through the metaphor to the condition of mind of which it was the subject. There was no greater physical difficulty in an old man re-entering his mother's womb than for a boy of twelve to do so; but being probably, not necessarily, an old man, and belonging to a society of grave, reverend elders, with the inveterate habits, practices, traditions, of long lives behind them, how impracticable and impossible does the notion of so complete a change appear to him! Hence his question. Westcott says admirably, "The great mystery of religion is not the punishment, but the forgiveness of sins; not the natural permanence of character, but spiritual regeneration." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man</span> (<span class="accented">any one</span>) <span class="cmt_word">have been born</span> (<span class="accented">out</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> This memorable utterance has been the occasion of much controversy, arising from the contested sanction thus supposed to be given to the <span class="accented">opus operatura</span> of baptism, and to the identification of water baptism with Spirit baptism. Expositors have asserted that the rite of water baptism is not merely regarded as the expressive symbol and prophecy of the spiritual change which is declared to be indispensable to admission into the kingdom, but the veritable means by which that baptism of the Spirit is effected. Now, in the first place, we observe that the sentence is a reply to Nicodemus, who had just expressed his blank astonishment at the idea that a fundamental change must pass over a man, in any sense equivalent to a second birth, before he can see the kingdom of God. Our Lord modifies the last clause, and speaks of <span class="accented">entering</span> into the kingdom of God rather than perceiving or discerning the features of the kingdom. Some have urged that <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 3 is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 5. The vision, say they, is only possible to those who partake of the privileges of the kingdom. But the latter phrase does certainly express a further idea - a richer and fuller appreciation of the authority and glory of the King; just as the "birth of water and of the Spirit" conveys deeper and further thought to Nicodemus, than did the previously used expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The first expression was dark in the extreme; the latter pours light upon it. "Birth of water" points at once to the method so frequently adopted in Jewish ceremonial, by which a complete change of state and right before God was instituted by water. Thus, a man who had not gone through the appropriate and commanded lustrations was unfit to present his offering, to receive the benediction sought by his sacrificial presentment; the priest was not in a fit state to carry the blood of the covenant into the holy place without frequent washings, which indicated the extent and defilement of his birth stain. Nicodemus for probably thirty years had seen priests and men thus qualifying themselves for solemn functions. So great was the  urgency of these ideas that, as he must have known, the Essenes had formed separate communities, with the view of carrying out to the full consummation the idea of ritual purity. More than this, it is not improbable that proselytes from heathen nations, when brought into covenant relation with the theocratic people, were, at the very time of this conversation, admitted by baptismal rites into this privilege. To the entire confusion of Pharisee and Sadducee, John the Baptist had demanded of every class of the holy people "repentance unto remission of sins," a demand which was accepted on the part of the multitudes by submitting to the rite of baptism. The vastly important question then arises' - Did John by this baptism, or by any power he wielded, give to the people repentance or remission of sins? Certainly not, if we may conclude from the repeated judgment pronounced by him self and by the apostles after him. Nothing but the blood and Spirit of Christ could convey either remission or repentance to the souls of men. John preached the baptism of repentance unto remission, but could confer neither. He taught the people to look to One who should come after him. He sharply discriminated the baptism with water from the baptism of the Spirit and fire. This discrimination has been repeatedly referred to already in this Gospel. Thus the Fathers of the Church saw distinctly that there was no regenerating efficacy in the water baptism of John, and the Council of Trent elevated this position into a canonical dogma. It is most melancholy that they did not also perceive that this judgment of theirs about the baptism of John applied to water baptism altogether. Christ's disciples baptized (not Christ himself, <a href="../../par/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>) with water unto repentance and remission; but even up to the day of Pentecost there is no hint of this process being more than stimulus to that repentance which is the gift of God, and to the consequent pardon which was the condition of still further communication of the Holy Spirit. The great baptism which Christ would administer was the baptism of Spirit and fire. The references to the baptism of the early Church are not numerous in the New Testament, but they are given as if for the very purpose of showing that the water baptism was not a necessary or indispensable condition to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius and his friends received the sacred bestowment <span class="accented">before</span> baptism. The language of the Ethiopian ennuch shows that he had received the holy and best gift of Divine illumination and faith <span class="accented">before</span> baptism. Simon Magus was baptized with water by Philip, but was in the gall of bitterness and un-spirituality. There is no proof at all that the apostles of Christ (with the exception of Paul) wore ever baptized with water, unless it were at the hands of John. Consequently, we cannot believe, with this entire group of facts before us, that our Lord was making any ceremonial rite whatsoever indispensable to entrance into the kingdom. His own reception and forgiveness of the woman that was a sinner, of the paralytic, and of the dying brigand, his breathing over his disciples as symbolic of the great spiritual gift they were afterwards to receive, is the startling and impressive repudiation of the idea that <span class="accented">Christian baptism in his own name</span>, or, still less, that that ordinance treated as a supernaturally endowed and divinely enriched sacrament, was even so much as referred to in this great utterance. But the entire system of Jewish, proselyte, and Johannine baptisms was in the mind of both Nicodemus and Christ. These were all symbolic of the confession and repentance, which are the universal human conditions of pardon, and, as a ritual, were allowed to his disciples before and after Pentecost, as anticipatory of the great gift of the Holy Spirit. No baptism, no "birth out of water," can give repentance or enforce confession; but the familiar process may indicate the imperative necessity for both, and prove still more a prophecy of the vital, spiritual transformation which, in the following verse, is dissociated from the <span class="accented">water</span> altogether. Calvin, while admitting the general necessity for baptism, repudiates the idea that the rite is indispensable to salvation, and maintains that "water" here means nothing different or other than "the Spirit," as descriptive of one of its great methods of operation, just as "Holy Spirit and fire" are elsewhere conjoined. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been born of the flesh, is flesh.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> is not the physical as opposed to the spiritual or immaterial. nor is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> necessarily sinful, as we see from <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, but as it often appears in John's writing and Paul's, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> is the constituent element of humanity as <span class="accented">apart from grace</span> - humanity (body, intellect, heart, conscience, soul, spirit) viewed on its own side and merits and capacity, without the Divine life, or the Divine supernatural inbreathing. The being born of the flesh is the being born into this world, with all the privations and depravations, evil tendencies and passions of a fallen humanity. Birth into the theocracy, birth into national or ecclesiastical privilege, birth that has no higher quality than flesh, no better germ or graft upon it. simply produces flesh, humanity over again. When the Logos "became flesh," something more than and different from ordinary traduction of humanity took place.  Destitute of any higher birth than the birth of flesh, man is fleshly, psychical, earthly, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14-25</a>), and, more than that, positively opposed to the will and grace of God, lashed with passions, defiled with debasing ideas, in enmity against God. Hence the birth "from the Spirit" is entirely antithetic to the birth from the flesh. <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been born of the Spirit, is spirit.</span> There is a birth which supervenes on the flesh-be-gotten man, and it is supernaturally wrought by the Spirit of God. As in the first instance, at man's creation, God breathed into man the breath of life, and by that operation man became a living soul; so now the new birth of man is wrought in him by the Spirit, and there is a new life, a new mode of being, a new bias and predomimating impulse. "A spiritual mind which is life and peace" has taken the place of the old carnal mind. He is "spiritual," no longer "psychical," or "carnal," but able to discern the things that are freely given to him. The eye of the spirit is opened, unsealed, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are revealed to him (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-5</a>). The reference to "birth of <span class="accented">water"</span> is not repeated, because the birth from water is relatively unimportant, and of no value apart from the Spirit-change of which it may be a picture, or even a synonym. More than that, the Spirit-birth, the Divine operation, is the efficient cause of that which, under the form of a human experience, is called <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. The human <span class="accented">metanoia</span>, rather than the new <span class="accented">birth</span>, is the great burden of our Lord's public address, as recorded in the synoptic Gospels. In both representations the same <span class="accented">fact</span>, the same condition and state of the human consciousness, is referred to. In "repentance," however, and in the moral characters which are the several preliminaries to the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount, a change is declared necessary for the constitution and inauguration of the kingdom of heaven. This change is there viewed from the standpoint of human experience, and urged in the form of a direct appeal to conscience. In this discourse to Nicodcmus the same change is exhibited on its Divine side, and as one produced by the Spirit of God. In the Sermon on the Mount "meekness," "poverty of spirit," "mourning," "hunger after righteousness," "purity of heart," the spirit of forgiveness and long suffering, are the moral conditions of those minds and hearts which would become the city of God and the light of the world (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1-12</a>). On this occasion, when addressing the learned rabbi, Christ sums all up in the demand for a birth from the Spirit - a new and spiritual recommencement of life from the Spirit of God. The clause found in the Vetus Itala and the Syriac, <span class="accented">quia Deus spiritus est, et de Deo natus est</span>, is a gloss sustained by no Greek manuscript authority. Thorns here quotes two interesting passages from Philo, 1:533, 599, where the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is spoken of as given to man from above, and where the supremacy of the spiritual over the fleshly is made the only guarantee of admission into the world of spirit. But Philo obviously meant the intellectual rather than the moral element in human nature, and prized the ascetic process rather than the supernatural regeneration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-7.htm">John 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.</span> Nicodemus had revealed, by his expressions of countenance or unrecorded words, his surprise. This further explanation deepened the solemnity of the first assertion by a bold antithesis between the birth of flesh producing nothing but flesh, however high its culture, and the birth of spirit from the Spirit himself, the heavenly and Divine Originator of all genuine repentance, and the sole Cause of the new life. Nicodemus was clinging more and more eagerly to the old ideas of national privilege, of sacramental purification, of soundly taught principles and habits. He marvelled at such representation which took the heart out of all his previous training. The Messianic kingdom for which he had been looking and longing seemed to fade away in the clouds of an utter mysticism, and to vanish out of his power of recognition. Our Lord gently reproved the expression of his surprise, and reminded him of the previous utterance, "<span class="accented">I</span> said to <span class="accented">thee, Ye</span>," etc. Nicodemus had come in the name of others. Jesus replies, and reasserts the principles for the entire group of persons which Nicodemus might be supposed to represent. We must not fail to notice that, whereas in other parts of the discourse our Lord speaks in the plural first person, yet be discriminates himself from. others in this statement. He does not say, "<span class="accented">We must</span>," etc., but "<span class="accented">Ye must</span>," etc. He  had no consciousness of personal need of regeneration, nor was <span class="accented">he</span> in the first case born as flesh from flesh.

The great majority of commentators and versions have held that the former of the two translations is correct; that the first time the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used, it refers to the wind, "the unseen similitude of God the Spirit - his most meet and mightiest sign;" and that, since the same word is used for the two things, Spirit and wind, the Lord, after the parabolic manner which he adopted (in the synoptic Gospels), took advantage of some gusts of roaring wind then audible, to call attention to the mystery and incomprehensibility of its origin or end, and to see a parallel between the unknown ways of the wind and the unknown points of application to the human spirit of the mighty energy of the living God. The passage, <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>, may have been in his mind (though there "Spirit" is as likely to be the reference as is the motion of the "wind," and our ignorance of the way of the Spirit is akin to our ignorance of the formation of bones in the womb of her who is with child), and the adoption of the unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/6-18.htm">John 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/7-25.htm">Matthew 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-40.htm">Acts 27:40</a>) is in support of the comparison between "wind" and the "Spirit;" while the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, the "voice" or sound of the wind in trees or against any barriers, and the other effects that the rapid motion of the air produces, gives a lively illustration of the method in which the Spirit of God works in human minds, revealing, not itself, but its effects. The parallel is not peculiar to Scripture (see the remarkable passage in Xenophon, 'Memor.,' 4:3-14; also 'Rig Veda,' 10:168). It is further urged that the following clause, <span class="cmt_word">So is every one that hath been born</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the Spirit</span> - meaning, <span class="accented">So doth it happen to every one who is born of the Spirit</span> - suggests the analogy between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in its material sense, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in its customary and deeper sense. Now, on the other hand, it appears to me that this latter clause is compatible with the older translation and application. There <span class="accented">is</span> a comparison, but it may be between the mysterious working, breathing of the Divine Spirit, whose "voice" or "word" may be heard, whose effects are present to our senses and consciousness, but the beginnings and endings of which are always lost in God, - and the special operations of Divine grace in the <span class="accented">birth</span> of the Spirit. There are numberless operations of the Spirit referred to in the Old Testament, from the first brooding of the Spirit on the formless abyss, to all the special and mighty effects wrought in creation, all the heightening and quickening of human faculty, all the conference of special strength upon men - their intellectual energies and Divine inspirations. Over and above all these, there is all the supernatural change wrought in souls by the Holy Spirit. Christ calls <span class="accented">this</span> a "birth of the Spirit," and declares that, according to all the mysterious comings and departings of the Spirit, leaving only manifold effects, so is the special Divine work which morally and spiritually recreates humanity. <span class="accented">Pneuma</span> is used three hundred and fifty times in the New Testament, and twenty times in this Gospel for "the Spirit;" and if the usage is reversed here, this is the solitary occasion. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, is, moreover, more appropriate to a living Being than to the wind. There is another way which suggests itself by which the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> may mean the same in both clauses: <span class="accented">The breath of God bloweth where it listeth</span>, etc., <span class="accented">so is every one born of the breath of God.</span> If this be possible, the form of the expression supplies a cooperating similitude drawn from the unknown origin and mighty effects of the unseen breath of heaven; and on this translation the comparison is drawn between all the ways of the Spirit and the special work of the Spirit in regeneration. An inference is deducible from either interpretation of this verse, incompatible with the theory that "birth from water" is equivalent to "regeneration in baptism." If the rite of baptism provided the moment and occasion of the spiritual result, we <span class="accented">should</span> know whence it came and  whither it went. We might not know "how," but we should know "when" and "whence" the spiritual change took place. But this knowledge is distinctly negatived by Christ, who herein declares the moment of the spiritual birth to be lost or hidden in God. Physical birth is a deep mystery, both whence the "spirit" comes and whither it goes; the signs of the presence of life are abundant, but there is an infinite difference between the stillborn or dead child and the living one. Similarly, the commencement of the Spirit's creation within our nature is lost in mystery. We discern its presence by its effects, by consciousness of a new life and sense of a new world all around the newly born, but the Spirit-birth, like all the other operations of the Spirit, is hidden in God.

Without doubt, the fact of human corruption, and the power of the Spirit of God to renovate, to change utterly down to the very core and heart of human nature, is a great dogma of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-9.htm">1 Samuel 10:9</a>, where God gave Saul another heart; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, the effect upon David; David's own prayer, <a href="../../par/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; and the great promises of God by <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). Nicodemus, an illustrious man, a teacher of ethers, presumably acquainted with the teaching of the Scriptures, need not have been in such doubt and amazement at the searching words of Jesus.

It is difficult to believe this in the curious and impressive change of person here adopted, and the return to the first person singular in ver. 12. There was some reason why Jesus, in making this particular saying, uses the plural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Luthardt says, "Christ and the Baptist." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Luther and Tholuck, "Christ and the whole prophetic company." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Stier, "The Three Persons of the blessed Trinity" (see Chrysostom, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Hengstenberg, Godet, Westcott, Moulton, have in various ways recognized the fact that the company of the disciples already called into the spiritual kingdom, and alive to the mighty power of the Spirit in recreating humanity, were present at this interview. They stood there to affirm the reality of the truth of which their Lord was speaking. Nothing in this sentence is incongruous with the experience and practice of those who had appreciated and were already speaking of the necessity of radical change or spiritual regeneration and of genuine repentance. John in his First Epistle (1 John 1:1-4) uses some of the very phraseology of this solemn verse, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Our Lord, on this occasion, gave him permission to do so. The knowledge which he spake of, the vision to which he testified, was in its way and to a degree within the compass of any disciple who had been waked up by the Lord's words to crave an entirely new beginning of his life, a birth of the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">And ye receive not our testimony.</span> This melancholy assertion proves that from the very first (as John said in his "prologue" concerning all the ministry of the Logos, and all the testimony of the prophetic Spirit to the reality of the light) "the darkness reeeiveth it not." The first demand which the Divine Lord made was rejected, the first "testimony" was disbelieved. From the beginning the dark shadow of death fell on his path. Nicodemus, or those whom he represented, may have had their curiosity excited, but their entire attitude was non-admission of the fundamental principle, viz. the inward illumination and life he came to supply. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-12.htm">John 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i>of</i> heavenly things?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</span> Our Lord here drops the plural form of address, and returns to the singular. He is about to refer to  matters in which the testimony of disciples was not available. It has sometimes been said that the "earthly" and "heavenly" things refer to the wind parable and its interpretation. But, on the supposition that there is a parable or metaphor in ver. 8, which we have seen reason to doubt, there would be no perplexity about the reception of the <span class="accented">earthly</span> illustration; none could in that day have made a moment's question touching the invisibility and incomprehensibility of the motion of the wind. The birth from water has been supposed by others to be the (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) "earthly" thing of which he had spoken, as contrasted with the heavenly thing, the birth anew from the Spirit. But this also is improbable, for of all the things of which Jesus spoke, that was the least likely to have been rejected by the Pharisaic party. The "earthly things" are the subject matter of the discourse as a whole, in apprehending which Nicodemus manifested such obtuseness. The change, renovation of human nature, the new beginning "from the Spirit" of each human life, was indeed operated on the ground of an earthly experience, and came fairly within the compass of common appreciation. Though produced by the Spirit, these things were enacted on earth. When Nicodemus asks the question "<span class="accented">how</span>?" he launches the inquiry into another region. There is wide difference between the question "what?" and the question "how?" The one in physical science refers to the whole range of phenomena, and the answer states the facts as they present themselves to the senses; the other question inquires into what Bacon called the <span class="accented">latens processus</span> - into <span class="accented">verae causae</span>, into the movements and method of the creative hand. So the answer to the question "<span class="accented">what</span>?" may be an "earthly thing," the answer to the question "<span class="accented">how</span>?" a "heavenly thing." If Christ answer the "how" of his listener, he raises his mind to the "heavenly" and transcendental realities which Nicodemus and we too will have to receive on an authority which entirely outsoars that of daily experience or temporal phenomena. Truly he does proceed to do so, but the difficulty of acceptance is indefinitely augmented. The answer of Christ to the matters of personal experience, verifiable by conscience and affirmed by Scripture, was difficult to the master of Israel. The answer of Jesus to the question "how?" may prove far more formidable. It involves the revelation of "the Son of man," and the redemption by the cross, and the ascension of the Son of man into heaven, and the love of God to the world, and the gift of eternal life to faith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a></div><div class="verse">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The truth concerning the Son of man and his sacrifice.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. The simple copula is here fuller significance. Olshausen regards it as "adversative," equivalent to "yet." Meyer, as a simple continuation of the previous statement. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> has more than a mere conjunctive force. Lance puts it thus: "And yet you must be told heavenly things by him who, being the Heavenly One, is himself the first subject of this revelation." <span class="cmt_word">No one hath ascended into heaven.</span> The past tense must be honestly considered. The word cannot refer to the future ascension of Jesus the Lord of glory to where he was before - to the glory which he had with the Father before the world was (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>); nor can it refer, as the Socinian interpreters supposed, to a rapture into heaven of the Divine Man between his baptism and temptation (Socini 'Opera,' 2:511, 610, quoted by J.P. Smith, 'Scripture Testimony to the Messiah,' 2, pp. 103-117), of which we have not the faintest trace either in Scripture or tradition; nor is it sufficient, with Hengstenberg and others, to regard it as a mere Hebraism for high and exalted intercourse with God and heavenly things. True, there have been many who have sought to climb the steep ascent (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>); true also that rabbis spoke of Moses having "ascended into the heavens," by which (says Whitby) they meant "admission to the Divine counsels." The authority on which he depends is the late 'Targum on Cantic. 1:5, 11, 12,' by which, however, all that is clear is that the Targnmist was referring to the ascent of Moses to the top of Sinai, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> above the multitude in the deserts, to the place whither Jehovah came to speak with him. But <a href="../../par/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>, the canonical Scripture, makes it clear that it was "from the heavens" that Jehovah spoke with his servant. There are, however, other passages quoted by Schottgen from Jerusalem Targum on <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-12.htm">Deuteronomy 30:12</a>, and from the 'Mishna,' in which Moses is said to have "ascended into heaven, and heard the voice of God;" but further inquiry leads us to judge that the Hebrew commentators were thinking of the going up to Sinai for his lofty revelations, and their followers have supposed that this process was a synonym of the revelations themselves. Many have thought to rise above the world to the beatific vision, but Jesus says none have done it in the only sense in which they would have been thereby fitted to discourse on the heavenly things. Two things are needed for this in the main - to be in heaven, and come thence charged with its Divine communications. Enoch, Elijah, may have been translated that they should not see death, but they are not so lifted into the abode of God that they might come thence charged with heavenly truth, and able to explain  the "how" of Divine grace. <span class="cmt_word">No</span> <span class="cmt_word">one hath ascended into</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven except he who has</span> by living there as in his eternal home <span class="cmt_word">come down from heaven.</span> Meyer, Luthardt, Westcott, etc., all call attention to other and analogous usage of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, which fastens upon a part of the previous negative, not the whole assertion, and therefore here upon the idea of living in heaven and coming thence (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>). Man, if he should presume to come with a full revelation of Divine and heavenly things, must come down from a height to which he had previously ascended; but no man has thus and for this purpose ascended, <span class="accented">except he who</span> <span class="accented">has descended from heaven</span>, having been there before his manifestation in the flesh, having been "in God." "with God," "in the bosom of the Father," and having come thence, not losing his essential ego, his Divine personality, even though calling himself <span class="cmt_word">the Son of man.</span> For any other to have come down from heaven, it was necessary that he should first have ascended thither; but the Son of man has descended without having ascended. He calls himself "Son of man," and he claims to have come down from heaven without ceasing to be what he was before. Godet urges that, by the "ascended into heaven," he meant such lofty communion with God and immediate knowledge of Divine things as to differentiate him from all others, but that the phrase, "come down from heaven," implies previous existence in his native place, and that the Lord's filial intimacy with God rests on his essential sonship. Still, he conceives that Jesus <span class="accented">asserts</span> his own ascension in the spiritual sense to the heart of God, and his <span class="accented">descent</span> with consequent resultant knowledge, and expounds both statements by the explanation that as Son of man he is living the twofold life in heaven and on earth at the same time. By using the term, "Son of man," Christ emphasized the exalted dignity that is involved in the extent of his self-humiliation,, and complete sympathy with us. He was the second Adam, the Lord from heaven." <span class="cmt_word">Who is</span> (not <span class="accented">was</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in heaven.</span> If this be only an early gloss, it throws light on the two previous clauses. It declares that, though he came down, and though his introduction to this world was an incarnation, yet that he is in the deepest sense still in heaven. Such language is a vindication of his claim to reveal heavenly things. Augustine says, "Ecce hic erat et in coelo erat, hic erat in carne, in coelo erat divinitate, natus de matre, non recedens a Patre." Again, "Si Paulus ambulabat in carne in terra et conversabatur in coelo, Deus coeli et terrae poterat esse et in coelo et in terra." Archdeacon Watkins says admirably, "If heaven is a state, a life, in which we are, which is in us, now in part, hereafter in its fulness, then we may understand, and with glad hearts hold to, the vital truth that the Son of man who came down from heaven was ever in heaven." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>.

From his Divine and endowed humanity thus shown to be competent to explain and re veal heavenly things, he proceeds to his atoning sacrifice. These underlying links of connection are not mutually exclusive. <span class="cmt_word">Even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must also the Son of man be lifted up.</span> The narrative of <a href="../../par/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8</a>, etc., is one of the most curious in Scripture, and it was a great puzzle to the Jewish commentators, who felt that it was in apparent violation of the second command of the Decalogue. Moreover, in the days of Hezekiah the reverence paid to the serpent led to disastrous consequences and puritanic removal of the idolatrous snare. The Jewish divines consulted by Trypho (see Justin Martyr, 'Dail.,' 94) were unable to explain it. Philo regarded it as a designed contrast to the serpent of the Book of Genesis, but he supposed the antithesis to be that between pleasure and righteousness or prudence ('De Leg. All.,' 2:1.80). The Book of Wisdom (Wisdom 16:6), "The murmuring people were troubled for a while for warning, having a symbol of salvation .... he that turned to it was saved, not by reason of that which he beheld, but by reason of the Saviour of all." Ferguson, in his 'Tree and Serpent Worship,' regards the narrative as an indication that within the bosom of Israel the worship of the serpent had been introduced and had left its traces. But the narrative itself shows that the serpent healing from the serpent bite was a Jehovistie symbol of Divine love and victory. The 'Test. XII. Patr. Benj.,' 9, refers to it as the type of the cross (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>). "Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent  had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived." The fiery flying serpent, with its poisonous bite and its deadly malice, was the vivid type of the evil of disobedience to the Divine command, infusing its malign venom into the whole nature of its victim. The serpent of brass was not venomous, though it bore the likeness of the deadly plague. It was not flying, gliding from tent to tent, but captured, still, hoisted triumphantly upon the pole, a sign of its conquest. The serpent in Hebrew and Christian literature throughout was emblematic of <span class="accented">evil</span>, not as in many Oriental religions, of healing or deliverance (see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; and, properly translated, <a href="../../par/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>, Revised Version); and it is possible to see in this type an anticipation of the "lifting up" of Jesus on the cross. There are several interpretations of the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Paulus urged that Jesus by it referred to the final glorification of himself; but if so, why was not the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> used? It may mean, with Bleek, Lechler, Godet, the exaltation upon the cross as the steppingstone to his glory, the way, not only to David's throne, but to the very throne of God - a conception profoundly different from the current Pharisaic notions concerning the Messiah. The word is used in <a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a> and John 12:32, 34 for the passion of the cross, although Peter (<a href="../../par/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>) and Paul (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) used it for the glorification consequent upon the Passion. Surely the word does, if it is to correspond with Moses' exaltation of the serpent of brass, point to the exaltation of the cross, but to that as to the very throne of his power and glory. Tholuck says, "A word must have been used in Aramaic which admitted both ideas, and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;&#x5e7;&#x5da;</span> means in Chaldee and Syriac to 'lift up' and 'crucify.'" Many striking relations thus present themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Lord was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, though without sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The evil of sin was seen in him conspicuously revealed, but conquered; not only conquered, but transformed into a remedy. The enemy of man, the world itself, was crucified on the cross of Christ. Sin was nailed to the cross when, in the likeness of sinful flesh, the eternal Son of God made flesh submitted to all the shame of the flesh. "The world is crucified unto me," says Paul ("in the cross of Christ"), "and I to the world." Jesus says, "Even so must the Son of man be lifted up." The Son of man here on earth, but having always a Divine life in heaven, when revealed in human nature, subject to the laws and destiny of the flesh, "must" be lifted up. This pathway to his glory must pass through the blood and agony of the Passion. There was a needs be in the Divine counsel, in the purposes of Divine love, in the fall measure of the grace which was welling from the heart of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The comparison, however, and relation between type and antitype is more conspicuous still in the fifteenth verse, where Jesus added: <span class="cmt_word">In order that whosoever believeth might have in him eternal life.</span> Granting that the above is the true text, in our translation an instance occurs of the frequent absolute usage of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> is not a Johannine phrase, while we do find (<a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>) that "life," "peace," are "in him"). On this ground, if we retain the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, we translate it as above. The object of faith is not specified; but he who believes, who looks with God-taught longing to the Christ, to the Son of man uplifted to save, sees God at his greatest, his best, and discerns the fullest revelation of the redeeming love. "Believing" corresponds with "looking" in the narrative of <a href="../../par/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. Whosoever "looked, lived." Such looking was an act of faith in the promise of Jehovah; the otherwise despairing, dying glance of poisoned men was a type of the possibility of a universal salvation for sin-envenomed, devil-bitten, perishing men. Let them believe, and there is life. Let them understand the meaning of the Son of man thus exhausting the curse, and enduring in love the burden and penalty of human transgression, and they have straightway a life that is spiritual, fundamentally and radically new, a life heavenly and eternal. Thus can this vast change of which he had spoken to  Nicodemus supervene. "<span class="accented">How</span>," asks Nicodemus, "can this be?" "Thus may it be," answers the Son of man. It is not necessary that all the mystery of the cross should have been perceived by Nicodemus, yet the subsequent references to this man make it highly probable that, when he saw Jesus suspended on the cross, instead of giving way to unbelief and despair, he was stimulated to an act of lofty faith (<a href="../../par/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>, and note). In this great utterance we have the answer which Paul addressed to the Philippian jailer, and we have the argument of Paul in <a href="../../par/romans/1.htm">Romans 1, 2</a>, and we infer that the sources of the Pauline doctrine were to be found in the known teaching of the Lord himself. Many commentators, beginning with Erasmus, and followed by Neander, Tholuck, Lucke, Westcott, and Moulton, have supposed that our Lord's discourse with Nicodemus ended with ver. 15, and that thenceforward we have the reflections in after times made by the evangelist, in harmony with the teachings which he had received from the Lord. This is urged on the ground that in <a href="../../par/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, and at the close of the present chapter (vers. 31-36), when reciting the testimony of the Baptist, it appears to the commentators that John has blended his own reflections with the words of the Baptist, adding them without break to the sentences which he does record (see notes). I am not prepared to admit the analogy; there is nothing in these words, if attributed to the Baptist, incompatible with the purely Old Testament position and transition standpoint to which he adhered. The argument drawn from the past tenses, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, is not incompatible with the large view of the whole transaction which the Son of God adopted, as though in the fulness of its infinite love it had already been consummated. We are told that there are certain phrases which nowhere else are ascribed to Jesus himself, such as "only begotten Son" - a term which is found in the prologue (<a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>) and First Epist. (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in John's own composition. The reply is that John used this great word on the specified occasion because he had heard it on the lips of Jesus; that he would not have dared to use it if he had not had the justification of such use, the like to which he here recounts. The believing <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;</span> - "on the name of" - does not occur, it is said, in the recorded words of Jesus, though it is found in the discourse of the evangelist himself in ch. 1:12; 2:23; and <a href="../../par/1_john/5-13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>. The same criticism applies. John used it because he had heard our Lord thus deign to express himself. Moreover, the commencement of the paragraph, by the use of the particle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, shows that no break has occurred, that a richer and fuller and more triumphant reason is to be given for the obtaining of life eternal than that which had already been advanced. He passes from the Son of man (who is in heaven, and came from heaven and God) to the Son of God, the only begotten of the Father. He speaks in more practical and explanatory form of the Object of faith, and the Divine source of the arrangement and its issues. A flood of new thoughts and some terms occur here for the first time; but they are no more startling than other words of Jesus, whose awful weight of meaning and rich originality gave to the evangelist all his power to teach. It is quite unnecessary to find fault with the abruptness of the close of this discourse, or the sudden cessation of the dialogue, or the disappearance of Nicodemus, or of any lack of affectionateness in the style of address. Christ is often abrupt, and in numerous replies which he gave to his interlocutors he prolongs the remarks as though they were addressed to the concealed mind of the speakers rather than to their uttered words. If there had been any hint or indication that these were John's reflections, we can only say that he who by the Holy Spirit penned the prologue was not incapable of these splendid and heart-searching generalizations of love, faith, judgment, and eternal life. But there does not appear to be any sufficient reason for such an hypothesis. Still, it must be admitted that we have not the whole of the former or the latter part of this wondrous discourse. Much has, without any doubt, been omitted. John has seized upon the most salient points and the loftiest thoughts. These stand out like mountain peaks above the glittering seas, indicating where the inner and hidden connections of their bases lie, but not unveiling them. We do not doubt that John's mind, by long pondering on the thoughts of Jesus and his words of profound significance, had acquired to some extent the method of his speech, and do not  doubt that a certain subjective colouring affects his condensation of the discourses of Jesus. He was not a shorthand reporter, photographically or telephonically reproducing all that passed. He was a beloved disciple, who knew his Lord and lost himself in his Master. He seized with inspired and intuitive accuracy the root ideas of the Son of man, and reproduced them with the power of the true artist. It is incredible, even if we regard the entire paragraph (vers. 16-21) as the language of our Lord, that we have the whole of the discourse, or conversation, of the memorable night. Still less satisfactory is it to suppose that we have in it nothing more than an imaginary scone, an idealization of the bearing of Christian truth on Jewish prejudice. So vast a thought, though it be the burden of the New Testament, and because it is so, issued from the heart of Jesus.

The Divine love is the sublime source of the whole proceeding, and it has been lavished on "the world." This world cannot be the limited "world" of the Augustinian, Calvinian interpreters - the world of the elect; it is that "whole world" of which St. John speaks in <a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>. "God will have all men to be saved" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). Calvin himself says, "Christ brought life, because the heavenly Father loves the human race, and wishes that they should not perish." Pharisaic interpretations of the Old Testament had left the outside world in judgment, to cursing and condign punishment, and had made Abrahamic descent and sacramental privilege the conditions of life and honour and royal freedom. Here the poor world is seen to be the object of such love, <span class="cmt_word">that he</span> - the Father-God - <span class="cmt_word">gave</span>, "delivered up," we do not know certainly to "what," but we may judge from the context that it was such a deliverance, or such giving up. as is involved in the uplifting of the Son of man upon his cross of humiliation and shame. But the Lord in,educes a more wonderful term to denote his own personality. This "Son of man" is none other than <span class="cmt_word">his only begotten Son (</span>cf. notes, <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>). Just as Abraham had not kept back his only begotten son from God, so God has not withheld his perfect Image, his Well-beloved, his Eternal Logos, the perfect ideal of sonship. He gave him with the following view: <span class="cmt_word">that whosoever believeth in him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>may not perish, but have eternal life.</span> The previous saying is repeated as in a grand refrain for which a deeper reason and fuller explanation have been supplied. Perishing, ruin, the issues of poisonous corruption, might and would, by the force of natural law, work themselves out in the destinies of men. The awful curse was spreading, but it may be arrested. None need be excluded. Looking is living. Believing in this manifestation of Divine love is enough. This is the first, high, main condition. Appropriation of such a Divine gift unriddles the mysteries of the universe, emancipates from the agelong bondage, confers a life which is beyond the conditions or occasions of dissolution. This verse is infinite in its range, and, notwithstanding a certain vagueness and indefiniteness of expression, presents and enshrines the most central truth of Divine revelation. When the terms "gave," "only begotten Son," "believeth," "life," "perishing," "God," "the world," are fully interpreted, then the words of this text gather an ever-augmenting force and fulness of meaning; and they may have been expanded to meet the prejudices of Nicodemus or the difficulties of disciples. The idea of gift and giver and the ends of the giving may have at once suggested to the Pharisaic mind the grand distinction between Israel and the world, and the inquiry may have been made - Is not Messiah, then, about to judge the world, to summon all the nations round to hear their doom? To some such heart-deadening query, to some such conscience-benumbing scepticism, our Lord continued - No; this love to the world on the part of God, this condition of faith on the side of man, thus laid down, is perfectly honest and sincere -

"Judgment" in this sense may be identical with "absolution," and may also connote "condemnation," but in itself it leaves the issue undecided) the world. Observe that the word "sent" replaces the word "gave" of the previous statement (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>). The word carries with it "the sending on a special mission" (see notes on John 20:21), and arrests attention by denoting the immediate function of the Son of God's mission into the world. He was sent, not <span class="accented">to judge</span>  <span class="accented">the world.</span> This judgment is not the end of his manifestation. This statement is not without difficulty, because we learn from <a href="../../par/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27, 28</a> and John 12:48 that there is a great function of judgment which will ultimately be discharged by him, and which does, indeed, follow from the contact of all men with his truth and light. This is confirmed by the declarations of our Lord in Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30, 47</a>), that the judgment would be delayed till the consummation of his work, but would then be most certain (see <a href="../../par/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>.). But judgment is not the end or purpose of his mission. Judgment, discrimination of the moral character of men, is a consequence, but not the prime nor the immediate <span class="accented">purport</span> of his coming. Numerous passages from the Book of Enoch and the Fourth Book of Esdras, and the literal interpretation of <a href="../../par/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, etc., may be quoted to show the Jewish prejudices against which our Lord here protested. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> God sent his Son <span class="cmt_word">that the world through him maybe saved.</span> "Saved" is here the analogue and interpretation of the not perishing and the having of eternal life. Christ is "the Saviour of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/4-42.htm">John 4:42</a>). Hengstenberg says truly, "The Old Testament basis for the words is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>, 'And all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.'" His coming will, as he goes on to say, exercise a discriminating process and a saving energy. There will occur a further advent, when he will consummate both his judgment and his mercy. "In the Old Testament," says Lunge, "the Judge becomes Redeemer by judging; in the New Testament, the Redeemer becomes Judge by his redeeming." Through him the world may be saved from its ruin, by reason of individuals accepting his grace. The saving of humanity as a whole issues from the believing and living of men. God's love of the world and his sending of his Son aim at the saving of the world as their Divine end. Salvation (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the largest of all the famous biblical terms which denote the restoration and blessedness of man. It means all that is elsewhere denoted by "justification," but much more than that. It connotes all that is included in "regeneration" and "sanctification," but more than these terms taken by themselves. It includes all that is involved in "redemption" and "adoption" and the "full assurance," and also the conditions of "appropriation" - the subjective states which are the human antecedents of grace received, such as "faith" and "repentance," with all the "fruits of the Spirit." These Divine blessings originated in the bosom of the Father, where the only begotten Son forevermore abides, and they are all poured forth through the Son upon the world in the coming of the Christ. He was sent to save. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Salvation is the Divine result of believing on him, and salvation lifts the saved man from the necessity of the judgment, of the moral discrimination which awaits every man, and is passed upon every man by his own conscience and by the providence of God. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> does not necessarily mean "to condemn" (see ver. 17), and whensoever the unfavourable issue of judgment is emphatically referred to, then <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> used (<a href="../../par/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a>). Still, this first clause shows that the predominant sense in which it is used throughout the passage is condemnatory. <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whoso submits and yields to the truth confessed and conspicuous in the Christ - he who accepts the mission of the Logos, both before and after the Incarnation (see notes on John 1:12-14) - <span class="cmt_word">is not judged.</span> If there be a judgment, it is one of acquittal. In his case judgment is salvation, salvation is the judgment. Faith, affectionate confidence in the supreme Judge, transforms the judgment into mercy, anticipates the Divine and gracious result. <span class="cmt_word">But he that believeth not</span> (subjective negative) <span class="cmt_word">has</span> <span class="cmt_word">been already judged,</span> and is now so adjudged (here the word seems necessarily to assume a condemnatory character) <span class="cmt_word">that he hath not believed on the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> Such non-belief reveals insensibility to truth, indifference to the reality of things, unsusceptibility to the light, and a moral perversity which has been persisted in. The approach to such a one of the Eternal Logos did not move him, the unveiling of the Divine face did not awe him into reverence. The sin of his life had blinded his eyes, closed his ears, hardened his heart, and the consequence was that when the Name of the only begotten Son was made known to him, like all previous Divine self-revelations, it exercised no commanding influence upon him, no convincing power, no saving grace. To refuse Christ, to manifest unbelief under such circumstances, proves that the laws of Divine judgment which are always going on have already enacted themselves. <span class="accented">He has been</span> (and <span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="accented">condemned.</span> He is "judged already," and the unbelief is the judgment which the self-acting moral laws, or rather which the Logos actively at work in every human being, pronounces upon him. The manner in which any man receives Divine revelation is the judgment passed upon his entire life up to that moment by the unerring and infallible wisdom of the supreme Judge. The final judgment is thus anticipated, but it is not irreversible, and, should repentance and faith supervene by Divine grace on this  stolid indifference and damnable unbelief, the once unbeliever will become the believer, the judgment upon whom is no more a judgment of condemnation, but one of life and peace. Nothing can indicate a more untractable, unspiritual, and carnal state than a refusal to admit so great and imposing a manifestation of the Divine nature as the Name of the only begotten Son of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The above interpretation is confirmed by the explanatory sentence which follows, and which is obviously meant to explain the <span class="accented">nature</span> of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="accented">process</span> of the judgment of which he had spoken. This crisis, in the case of the believer, furnishes a clear and illustrious proof that the Son of God had primarily come to save, not to judge; while in the case of the unbeliever it was sufficiently manifested by the absence of faith in that which was so sublimely adapted to induce affectionate reverence and adoring trust. <span class="cmt_word">Now this is the judgment.</span> The peculiar form of the sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, is found elsewhere in John (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11, 14</a>). We are here reminded of the words of the prologue (<a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5, 9</a>, see notes), where the original shining of the Light in the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (the abiding state of darkness) ended in non-reception, non-perception of the Light. Subsequently it is said that the light - the archetypal light which illumines, shines upon, every man who comes into the world - came, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a new and more impressive manner, and by its coming, originated a process of judgment and discrimination among men. This utterance of the prologue is here shown to depend upon the words of the only begotten Son of God made flesh. The critical school make this correspondence with the prologue and with Johannine thought incontestable evidence that we have here John's meditation rather than the word of Jesus. There is, of course, an alternative interpretation. But it appears to us that it is equally rational and critical to see in the words of Jesus thus reported, the origin of the prologue. <span class="cmt_word">Light has come into the world, and</span> made evident and established the awful fact that men loved (aorist, denoting a defined characteristic) <span class="cmt_word">the darkness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, used here and <a href="../../par/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a> for absolute darkness, the complete contradictory of the light), <span class="cmt_word">rather than the light.</span> Lucke has urged that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here might mean <span class="accented">magis</span>, not <span class="accented">potius</span>, and that the Lord admits a certain amount of love for the light, though less than that for the darkness; but numerous passages of similar construction make it certain that <span class="accented">potius</span>, not <span class="accented">magis</span>, is the meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>). "The light," though so needed, and so lovely in itself, was not loved by men. It brought consequences from which "men" recoiled and revolted. They loved their own ignorance and peril. They shrank from the demands - from the repentance, the transformation of habit and character, the utter moral revolution that must be consequent upon the reception of the light. Darkness was loved, hailed, accepted, rested in. The process of the judgment was conspicuous in demonstrating this unholy love. If a man love the deformed, the misshapen, the defiled, and the corrupt thing, rather than the truly beautiful, this is a judgment passed upon his entire previous life and on his present character, which is the outcome and upshot of the life. If a man love sensual gratification, its objects and its means, rather than virtue and chastity and serene and sacred purity, this is in itself a terrific <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - the announcement of his previous career of dissipation and folly. If a man love the darkness of unrenewed humanity rather than the uncreated light embodied, this is his <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the process by which it is made evident is the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> passing over him. The explanatory clause that follows gives great force to the previous assertion: For their works were evil. Their habitual conduct supplies permanence and energy to their perverse "love," and reveals its historical antecedent - their works (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) were "evil" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>). The <span class="accented">love</span> of darkness was the consequence of their wicked <span class="accented">ways.</span> The judgment of eternal law has fallen upon their violation of it. The great penalty of sin is sinful desire. A bias towards evil is originated and confirmes by sinful compliance. The blinding of the eye, deafening of the ear (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10</a>, and parallels), is the judicial result of their unwillingness to see or walk in the light of the Lord.

This practice of bad ways (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) leads infallibly, by the just judgment of God, <span class="cmt_word">to</span> a hatred of that which will reveal and confound the transgressor. <span class="cmt_word">Every one,</span> etc., <span class="cmt_word">hateth the light</span> (this shows that we cannot err in giving to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 19 the sense of <span class="accented">potius</span>), and the hardening process which is a judgment of God upon man, ever going on, becomes more conspicuous in this, that <span class="cmt_word">he cometh not to the light, in order that his</span>  <span class="cmt_word">works may not be convicted;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lest his works should be revealed - shown to him and to others in their true light. The night time, during which so many evil things, base things, unclean things, are practised, was darkening down over Jerusalem when our Lord was speaking, and would give fateful emphasis to these solemn words. This love of darkness proceeded from a hatred of the revealing power of the light. This rejection of the only begotten Son of God proceeded from a long habit of sin, showing more emphatically than before the need of radical spiritual regeneration - a birth of water and of the Spirit. The rejection of the Christ's claim to cleanse the temple - a fact of which Nicodemus, as Sanhedrist, must have been fully aware - was a striking illustration of his great argument. The "dread of the light is both moral pride and moral effeminacy" (Meyer). (See parallel in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11, 12</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that doeth the truth</span> - who is "of the truth," and "heareth his voice" (<a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>), he who is "morally true," inwardly sincere, who would never shrink from a genuine self-revelation - <span class="cmt_word">cometh to the light.</span> This remarkable expression allies itself with many other words of Christ, and suggests that in the heart of Judaism and of mankind generally, amid and notwithstanding the darkness which prevailed, there were found elect souls, taught of the Spirit, longing for more light, yearning to know the truth about themselves, however humiliating it might prove to be. This is confirmed by St. Paul's argument (<a href="../../par/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a> and 2), where some Gentiles who have not the Law are admitted to do by nature the things contained in the Law, and even to become a law unto themselves; and where, in contradistinction to the hopelessly rebellious, Paul assumes that there are some who "by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory, honour, and immortality." These "do the truth, and have no pleasure in unrighteousness." They are "taught of God," they have "seen and heard from the Father" some of the great things of the Law. The Holy Spirit has opened their eyes to see great things in the Law, and they come to the light. They are not afraid of the revelation it will make. They may be humbled and pained by the disclosure, but there is a Divine luxury in such pain. The purpose of the coming to the light on the part of one who doeth the truth, is <span class="cmt_word">in order that his works may be made manifest.</span> This is the precise contrary of the conduct of the man whose eye is scaled and whose heart is made fat by sin. Such a one dreads <span class="accented">conviction</span>, the outward affirmation or utterance of the inwardly known <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and therefore shrinks from conviction or any conduct which will promote it. He flees from the man of God, he disdains the revealing Word, he rejects the blessed Christ, he loves the darkness, this <span class="accented">is</span> his condemnation. On the other hand, the sincere man, who is honest with himself, is supremely anxious for the true light to bear down upon his "works." He is willing that they should be manifested. If he is deceiving himself with false hopes, he yearns that these should disappear before the shining of the true light. If his works will bear examination, then let him know the verdict which is unconsciously being given by the revelation of the light. It is a nice question to determine the meaning of the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. The current interpretation is for, or <span class="cmt_word">because, they are wrought in God;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sincere man desires this self-manifestation, comes to the light because his works have been inwrought by Divine grace. He loves the light, he does the truth <span class="accented">because</span> God has wrought within him to will and to do. In other words, the work of grace is in every case the adequate explanation of such a contrast to the common condition of human nature. Godet suggests that <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> here has the meaning of "that," and urges that the Greek usage in <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> and other passages will justify the translation, <span class="accented">he cometh</span>...  <span class="accented">manifest, that they are wrought in God</span>, as though this Divine revelation were the real end of his coming to the light. This appears to me to be incompatible with the fact. The man who doeth the truth may yet need very much instruction before he accepts the Divine Original of his own conduct, or desires the manifestation to others of the Divine Source of his humble search. The more current translation, "because," is in harmony with the facts of Christian and religious experience, and is in keeping with the biblical assurance, that all good, all holiness, sincerity, and upright striving, just such as Nicodemus was then displaying, is God's own work, and is the result of his grace. Nicodemus comes, asks questions, receives weighty answers, and retires. We do not know the immediate result of these most wonderful words upon him; but we do find him taking the part of Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href="../../par/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50, 51</a>); and from <a href="../../par/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a> we learn that, though a secret disciple, he did not disdain to come out of his hiding place to houour the corpse of the Crucified. The death of Jesus, which had blasted the hopes of the apostles, had fired those of Nicodemus. Every word of this discourse is compatible with the position of the great Prophet at this early period of his ministry, is suited to the Pharisaic mind, and adapted to meet its difficulties and  correct its prejudices. If a few expressions, such as "the only begotten Son," "this is the condemnation, that," "he that doeth the truth," are found in writings which are John's undoubted composition, the circumstance may be explained that he borrowed them from Jesus. This is quite as rational (not to say legitimate and reverential) as to suppose, because of them, that John invented them, and betrayed their origin by placing them in the lips of Jesus. We do not suppose that John has mechanically recited the whole of the words that were spoken on either side, but preserved those heads of discourse which rise like mountain peaks above the oceans of thought between them, and are linked together by the glory which they severally reflect from the sublime personality of the Son of man.

Surrounded or accompanied by some of his disciples (John being one of them), Jesus left the metropolis and betook himself to the countryside. His Messianic claims were not accepted by the authorities. He did not entrust himself to the half-believers. He altered or deviated from the course hitherto adopted, and addressed himself to the less-prejudiced inhabitants of the country places in the province of Judaea. His hour was not yet come. Jerusalem and Judah were thus compared or contrasted in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/7-14.htm">Ezra 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-18.htm">2 Chronicles 20:18</a>. The precise locality is not stated, though it is probable it was not far from the new scene chosen by John for the continuance of his ministry. The identification of the site of <span class="accented">Aenon</span>, near <span class="accented">Saleim</span>, does not finally determine the <span class="cmt_word">scene of our</span> Lord's abode or baptismal ministry. We are expressly told, both here and in <a href="../../par/john/4-3.htm">John 4:3</a>, that it was in Judaea, not Samaria, that <span class="cmt_word">Jesus there tarried with them, and was baptizing.</span> The words imply a lengthened abode, and a method of ministry which, from that time, he laid aside. The statement that he administered the rite personally is in <a href="../../par/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a> explicitly corrected. The baptism by the disciples was done, however, with the sanction and under the direction of Jesus. As the trial ministry of the twelve apostles (mentioned in <a href="../../par/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a>.), occurring during our Lord's earthly life, corresponded with the first preaching of John rather than with that which followed the glorification of Jesus and the Pentecostal effusion, so this ordinance closely resembled the water baptism of John; it was a preparatory symbol, an educational rite, one that allied this early ministry to that of his great forerunner. The water baptism of Jesus corresponded in significance with the water baptism of John. They were one and the same ordinance, predictive, symbolic, anticipatory of the baptism of the Spirit. "Jesus adopted John's baptism ere its waters forever ceased to flow, and thus he blessed and consecrated them. He took up the work of his forerunner and completed it" (Edersheim, 1:393). Weiss (with consent of Renan) admits that these reminiscences reveal their own historicity, and none more so than the return of Jesus for a time to the scenes of the activity of the Baptist. Apparently such an act conflicts with the exalted ideas the author of the Fourth Gospel entertains with reference to his Master. Thoma thinks he sees in Pauhne writings indication of Christ's baptismal ministry, and suggests that the "Johannist" therefore finds a place for such "a washing in water by the Word" in the active word of Jesus! When our Lord, after his resurrection, referred to the baptism with the Spirit, he contrasted it with the baptism of John, and made no reference to his own temporary adoption of the same rite. All water baptism is thus placed in its true relation to the baptism of the Spirit - not as the necessary preliminary of the latter, nor its indispensable seal or guarantee, but as the impressive symbol of the need of heavenly cleansing, and of the direct impact upon the soul of the power of the eternal Spirit. The length of our Lord's residence in Judaea cannot be positively determined; but one hint may be gathered item <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>. The "four months before the harvest" indicate the arrival of the month of December, and therefore the lapse of some eight months between the cleansing of the temple and the return to Galilee. This last event, in Matthew's Gospel (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-17</a> with parallels), is associated with the imprisonment of John. The Fourth Gospel, by obvious reference to  the current synoptic chronology of the commencement of the Galilaean ministry (one which made this imprisonment a note of time), shows that the period described in this Gospel, and the baptismal energy of Jesus in Judaea, and the profoundly interesting events mentioned in ch. 3. and 4, were not incompatible with admitted facts. It also suggests that the character of our Lord's ministry in the neighbourhood of the metropolis was closely allied with that which the synoptists described as obtaining in his early Galilaean efforts. We are impressed by the solemn silence which has fallen over these eight months. It may be accounted for on the general principle of the evangelist, which was to fasten upon and preserve the memory of a few solemn moments which especially impressed his own mind, and which had been overlooked or unknown by Matthew and the other evangelists. Moreover, it is more than probable that the author of this Gospel was not with the Master during the whole of this period. There are, however, hints that the rumours of the spiritual might and gathering power of Jesus had produced a great effect upon John the Baptist, and qualified the tone of his last testimony. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a></div><div class="verse">And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And John also was baptizing in AEnon, near to Salim, because there were many waters there; and they came, and were baptized.</span> There is much difficulty in determining the site of AEnon, near Saleim. Eusebius and Jerome (in 'Onomasticon') place it in the northern part of Samaria, about eight miles south of Scythopolis (Jerome, 'Ad Evagrium,' Ep. 126; Epiph., 'Haer.,' 55:2; Winer, 'Real Wort.,' 1:33; Lucke, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>; Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 2:176). This does not well accord with the statement that Jesus was "in Judaea," and proposed to "pass through Samaria" (cf. ver. 22; <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-4</a>). It may be observed, however, that our narrative does not limit the scene of our Lord's Judaean ministry to any one place, nor does it assert that the Baptist and Jesus were in near proximity, but rather the reverse. There is a <span class="accented">Shilhim</span> mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>, with which is associated an <span class="accented">ain</span> (or fountain) - a word closely resembling "<span class="accented">AEnon."</span> This would seem to have been in the south of Judaea. Godet thinks that, since <span class="accented">Ain</span> and <span class="accented">Rimmon are</span> associated with each other in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>, and an <span class="accented">En-Remmon</span> is spoken of in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>, that we have in this blending the origin of the word "<span class="accented">AEnon</span>." He thinks that the presence of waters is more likely to be specified in a dry region like that of the border of Edom than in a fertile district like Samaria; and he goes on to argue that Jesus may therefore have travelled south between Hebron and Beersheba, even as, in the synoptics, we find him in Caesarea Philippi, the northernmost portion of the Holy Land. Certainly he may have tarried there during the eight months, but we have no right to establish it from this passage. It is not said that Jesus was at AEnon. Dr. Barclay (1858) reports the discovery of AEnon at <span class="accented">Wady Far'ah</span>, a secluded valley five miles northeast of Jerusalem (Grove, Smith's ' Dict. Bible'). The recent discoveries of the Palestine Exploration Society find this Enun (<span class="accented">Aynun</span>) and Saleim not far from the <span class="accented">Askar</span>, or Sychar, where Jesus rested when John's ministry had been suddenly arrested. (Edersheim thinks that this Enon and Salim in <span class="accented">Wady Far'ah</span> leading from Samaria to the Jordan, are too far apart; but see 'Pal. Exp. Fund Report,' 1874, p. 141; 'Pict. Palestine,' 2:237; 'Tent-Work in Palestine,' 1:91-93.) Allegory reaches the point of absurdity when we are told by Theme that neither place nor time are historic. The <span class="accented">Salem</span> is (says he), according to <a href="../../par/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>, the tabernacle or place of God, and therefore, according to Philo, indicates the Logos, who thenceforth becomes the Illuminator and Ruler. "The multitude of waters" would be suitable, necessary, to any great gatherings such as those which had followed the Baptist to the banks of the Jordan, as well as for baptismal processes. Such a site for AEnon is far more probable, on historical grounds, than is the southern extremity of Judaea; for Herod would have had no jurisdiction there, and would not have been tempted to arrest John's ministrations, nor would he or Herodias have suffered from the Baptist's rebuke of their adultery, if such reproaches had been spoken so far away from the centre of his tetrarchy. If, however, John had made no secret of his disapproval in regions so near to Galilee and Peraea, over which he presided, the consequent irritation of the voluptuous prince may have been more easily aroused, and his vengeance more legitimately taken. But how came John to be still administering baptism with a group of disciples of his own, and doing this long after the amazing announcements he had made in the spring of the year with reference to the rank and functions of the Lord Jesus? This narrative is the true key to the otherwise inexplicable contrariety between the Johannine testimonies to Christ and the message from the prison as described by the synoptists. It is the solution of the mystery that one who hailed Jesus as the Son of God and the Lamb of God and Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, and who was declared by Christ himself to be the greatest of woman born, was, notwithstanding, "less than the least in the kingdom of heaven." John is here shown by <span class="accented">the fourth evangelist</span>  to have been still taking an independent position. He pointed others to Jesus, but he did not enroll himself among his followers. John was at last "offended" more than he knew at the humility of Jesus. He still waited for the coming of the Conqueror and the Wielder of the axe; he was looking for the manifested King, for the hour which had not yet come. He is a remarkable specimen of the energy with which a great purpose is embraced by those who are pledged to make it accomplish its end. The preparatory work of John could not, any more than the Hebraism of which it was the highest type, come to an abrupt end voluntarily; hence he continued it even to the peril of sacrificing all its value. <span class="accented">They came, and were baptized</span>; as "they" had done at Bethabara. There was some splitting up of the Messianic movement (Keim), and we see the effect of it upon his disciples and him self. Even in the midst of the labours of Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1-4</a>), we find that Johannine baptism was still practised, and traces of the custom may still be observed in Oriental sects even to the present day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a></div><div class="verse">For John was not yet cast into prison.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For John had not yet been cast into the prison.</span> This clause shows that the evangelist was alive to the apparent discrepancy which his account of a Judaean ministry might otherwise have suggested with the synoptic chronological <span class="accented">initium</span> of the Galilaean ministry. The remark shows that all that happened preceded that ministry, and equates the journey through Samaria with that mentioned in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>. Even Hilgenfeld says, "<span class="accented">Involuntarily</span> the fourth evangelist here testifies to his acquaintance with the synoptical narrative." In our opinion it was designed and spontaneous. The first journey to Galilee, mentioned in <a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, was not the commencement of a public prophetic ministry, and the synoptists are silent about it. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he "<span class="accented">withdrew</span>," shows that there was some reason for his abrupt departure, over and above what was stated. John gives the reason for the departure by <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, where the conduct of the Pharisees was becoming more watchful and jealous. The authority which John here assumes to correct and enlarge apostolic tradition, reveals the claim of one who professed unique knowledge of inexpugnable facts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-25.htm">John 3:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then there arose a question between <i>some</i> of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There arose therefore a</span> <span class="cmt_word">questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew</span> <span class="cmt_word">about purifying.</span> Such proximity of two such leaders, teaching and proclaiming the kingdom of heaven, and baptizing into a glorious hope, a Divine future, and a spiritual change, was certain to excite controversy. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) "questioning" is used in <a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a> for the dispute at Antioch, and Paul uses the same phrase for dangerous, useless, and angry debate (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>). It was, perhaps, not the first, and certainly it was not the last, of the controversies which raged over the symbolic purification of the Church. John's disciples appear to have taken up arms against some particular <span class="accented">Jew</span>, who was prepared either to question the right of Jesus to baptize, or the essential value of this ordinance. This "Jew" was apparently maintaining a greater potency for the baptism of Jesus than John could claim for his, and was basing his view upon the testimony which John had already borne to Jesus. <span class="accented">Purifying</span> was the great theme of Essenic and Pharisaic profession. It was without doubt one of the great symbolic purposes of the Levitical legislation. The purification of the flesh was, however, in Christ's teaching, a very small part of the claim for purity. Nothing less than a spiritual and radical moral change availed, and our Lord insisted on this to the disparagement of the mere ceremonial. This was the first recorded discussion on the nature and value of baptismal purifying. Would that it had been the last! The question arose among those who had been baptized by John, whether another had any right to administer such an ordinance? Could another receive the confession of sins? Was the baptism of John to terminate now that he had come of whom John himself had said, "This is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a></div><div class="verse">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <i>men</i> come to him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span> (the disciples of John) <span class="cmt_word">came to John, and said to him, Rabbi</span> - the title of deep respect (ver. 2), which stood in Jewish reverence high above all civil and military rank, and was here yielded in courtesy to the heroic leader - <span class="cmt_word">he who was with thee,</span> apparently in entire mutual understanding with thee, receiving baptism at thy hands, and thus admitting thy right to baptize the people of God - "with thee" as we are "with thee" - <span class="cmt_word">beyond Jordan</span> - at Bethany (Bethabara), at a better baptizing - place than this, on a grand historic site, the very scene of the great administration, where the Sanhedrin deferred to thy claims and  the multitudes attested the hold thou hadst <span class="cmt_word">on</span> their affections - <span class="cmt_word">to</span> <span class="cmt_word">whom thou hast borne testimonies</span> - the man who received thy homage, but who admitted also thy claims, about whom thou didst utter such strong things of unspeakable import - <span class="cmt_word">behold</span>, he is now thy rival in popular esteem; <span class="cmt_word">this</span> <span class="cmt_word">man is baptizing, and</span> - with a pardonable exaggeration, they add - <span class="cmt_word">all men are coming unto him.</span> He is eclipsing thee; he seems to usurp the high and unique position which had been assumed by thyself. Serious questions these, which must lead to a complete disruption among the disciples of John. Before examining the reply of John to the query, it is well to observe that John had been walking in the blinding and bewildering light of new ideas; that the Fourth Gospel brings us into contact with John at the moment where the synoptic narrative draws its portraiture to a conclusion; and yet the Fourth Gospel, quite as firmly as the synoptists, shows that the fresh light which had dawned on John had not induced him to forego the preparatory mission on which his heart was set, and the zeal of which had consumed him. If the perplexity arises - How could John have borne such ample testimony to Jesus and not at once have followed in his train? we reply that the language of John in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-14.htm">Matthew 3:14</a> is just as difficult to reconcile with the message from the prison. Thoma admits that this fact corresponds with the question, "Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?" In like manner, Hebraism itself within the bosom of the Church maintained a place after all its purpose had been fulfilled. The destruction of the temple and of the Jewish state was necessary to abolish the force of the Hebrew tendency to ritualism of place and symbol even in the heart of Christ's disciples. Many of the mighty powers of the world, if they had not possessed an energy and vitality which refused to succumb when their work was really done, would never have done that work at all.

"My function is, as I am about to explain, a subordinate one," "I have received that and nothing else from heaven."

Perhaps "heaven" is not exactly identical with "God," but may point to the whole of the providential circumstances, to the Divine resources, to the inheritance of effects from more remote antecedents in the Divine will; but it is difficult to press this distinction in all cases.

This announcement, made with great publicity at Bethany, was the basis of the present remonstrance; and the words which follow strongly sustain John's reference to the Divine predestination in his own case and that of Jesus (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> may point back to the discourse of John, or may simply indicate transition to the second statement). <span class="cmt_word">But that I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am one sent</span> (on a special mission) <span class="cmt_word">before him</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a></div><div class="verse">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - And now the Baptist bethinks him of another remarkable image, with which, as a student of the Old Testament, and being himself "more than a prophet," He was familiar. The tenderness of the imagery had not hitherto, however, comported with the ministry of the <span class="accented">vox clamantis.</span> Whereas the New Testament represents the loving kindness and righteousness of the Lord God under the metaphor of a <span class="accented">Father's</span> love to his prodigal but repenting children, the prophets were often disposed to set forth the same idea in the light of a <span class="accented">Husband</span> yearning over his bride, even betrothing her a second time unto himself after her faithlessness and folly. Jehovah and Jehovah's King and Representative are set forth as the Bridegroom of the true Israel (<a href="../../par/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; the <a href="../../par/songs/1.htm">Song of Solomon 1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-11.htm">Malachi 2:11</a>, etc.); and the New Testament writers, especially John himself, who delights in the image (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>), and Paul, who compares the relation of the Saviour to his Church under this endearing imagery (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), vindicate the legitimacy of the metaphor. The Baptist might easily think of this language, but it is more than possible that he had been profoundly touched by the news that had reached him concerning the presence of Jesus at a marriage feast. John had been a Nazarite from his birth. Jesus was revealing himself amid the pleasures and innocent joys of life and love. John's conception of the kingdom had been that of severance from the world - seclusion, ascetic restraint. Jesus had manifested his glory amid the festival and in the common life and daily ways of men. John may have seen that there was much in this to captivate the heart of the true Israel; and he glances at the bridal of heaven and earth in this new conception of the mission of the Messiah. It may have staggered him, as he had taught Israel to hope for One whose hand would be more heavy upon them and on their sins than his had been. Where was the axe laid at the root of the trees? where the fire that scorches to cleanse and purify? But he accepted to some extent the new revelation, and found his own place in the novel reconstruction of the kingdom. So he says, <span class="cmt_word">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom.</span> However, John throws in a novel thought, explanatory of his own position, and not found in the Old Testament imagery: "I am not the Bridegroom," says he; "but it is also true that I am not the Bride. Such is my position that I am standing outside the company of those who are the prophetic 'Bride.'" <span class="cmt_word">The friend</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the bridegroom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, answering to the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> of the Aramaic writers) is he who acts the part of intermediary - the confidant of both. He presides at the ceremonies of the betrothal and at the wedding tent, and especially in the interests of the bridegroom. The image was probably suggested to him by the great discovery made by the friend of the Cana bridegroom touching the "glory" of the mysterious Guest on that typical occasion. "The friend of the bridegroom" differs profoundly from the Bridegroom. The Christ will prove ready to occupy this position, and John has declared that he is not the Christ. Moreover, John differs from the Bride; he does not receive the lavish love, nor the deep intimacies of that affection, nor the dowry of sacrificial devotion with which that love will at length be won. This <span class="accented">paranymphios <span class="cmt_word"></span>standeth and heareth him.</span> It is not said, "seeth him." Some have argued that John here calls attention to the fact that all that the Bridegroom has been saying has reached him by means of the information brought to him on the part of those who were both his own disciples and the disciples of Jesus; but the next clause is inconsistent with this. The friend of the bridegroom stands ready to do the will and promote the honour and pleasure of his friend. (The materialistic and sensualistic manner in which some have pressed the force of the imagery is out of place.) "The voice of the bridegroom," the hilarious joy of the bridegroom, is a proverbial expression (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>). There is a contrast felt between the formal business-like fellowship that prevailed between the bride and the friend of the bridegroom, and the free outspoken love of the bridegroom himself. The lispings of prophecy are contrasted with the outspoken utterances of the gospel of love. <span class="cmt_word">And he rejoiceth with joy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; cf. for this form of expression, which corresponds with the frequent Hebrew juxtaposition of the finite verb with the infinitive absolute, the LXX. of <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-10.htm">Isaiah 66:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-14.htm">Acts 23:14</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>). It is not an indubitable Hebraism, because similar expressions are found in the classics, as Plato, 'Sympos.,' 195, B., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>; 'Phaedr.,' 265, D.; Soph., 'OEd. Rex,' 65; see Winer, 'Gramm. E.T.,' p. 585. This is the only place where such a construction occurs in the writings of John) <span class="cmt_word">because of the bridegroom's voice.</span> Intense joy is thus ascribed to one who was the minister of the bliss of another. <span class="cmt_word">This my joy</span> - or, <span class="accented">this joy, therefore, which is mine</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>hath been made full.</span> "I have thus completed my task, and reached the climax of my bliss. I have wooed and won," The bridal of heaven and earth is begun. In subsequent words of Jesus and his disciples other great epochs of complete consummation are referred to. The joy of the Lord will only  be entirely realized when, after the resurrection and the second advent, the rapture of fellowship with his Bride will be completed. But the Baptist recognized that his own work was finished when the Messiah had been introduced to those who understood something of his claims, when the kingdom was at hand, when there were many who sought and found their Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a></div><div class="verse">He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He must -</span> by a Divine necessity of things (cf. vers. 7, 14; <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>), he must - <span class="cmt_word">increase</span>; augment in power and following and great joy.

His is the beginning of an eternal blessedness. <span class="cmt_word">I must decrease;</span> not become annihilated, though through the very completion of the purpose of my calling of God, my scope must, by the nature of the case, become narrower and smaller. Some have felt the improbability of the great prophet, the ascetic reformer, acquiescing so patiently in the diminution of his influence or the virtual cessation of the primary importance of his career. Yet this is in complete harmony with John's repeated and continuous recognition of the preparatory and transitory nature of his own work. He cannot lay down his commission, but he knows that, like prophetism, priesthood, Nazarite asceticism, and the like, it will be merged in the grander life of which he was the herald. The ministers of the New Testament all take up the same note of Divine praise and of self-depletion as they prepare the way of the Lord to human hearts. They hide themselves behind the greater glory of their Lord. However considerable their powers, they are serviceable only as they contribute to the glory, and succeed in unveiling the thee, of their Lord. There is a Johannine message still required to disturb the fleshly equanimity and to break up the narcotized sleep of the unbeliever. The stern spirit of rebuke and warning is still indispensable; yet the voice of him that cries, "Repent!" knows that his voice may fade away into faint echoes and stillness, so soon as the promises of redemption and salvation are uttered by the Divine Lord. When the absolution of grace gives the kiss of peace to the broken-hearted, the morning star fades into the dawning of the day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a></div><div class="verse">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - A large number of commentators of all schools hold that the remaining verses of this chapter give us the reflections of the evangelist rather than a continuous discourse of the Baptist. Strauss, Weisse, Reuss, and Bretschneider, who make the supposed proof of this Johannine appendix to the Baptist's words an evidence of inhistoricity throughout the Gospel, and the school of Baur, which finds in the entire representation simply an artistic endeavour on the part of a second century <span class="accented">falsarius</span> to show that John's disciples were absorbed into the Catholic Church, are joined here by Bengel, De Wette, Westcott, Moulton, and Edersheim, who see no difficulty in the introduction of these sentiments, which correspond with those of the Epistles of John, as an appendix of the evangelist, and not a reminiscence of the teaching of the Baptist. The reasons in favour of this view are that the ideas and phraseology are said to be far in advance of John the Baptist's theological position, and certainly reflect the later teaching of the Master. We will consider some of these <span class="accented">seriatim</span>, but cannot accept the argument as final. Hengstenberg, Meyer, Godet, Alford, Lange, even Renan, do not yield to the positions thus assumed, nor will they admit any word of the Baptist here uttered to be inconsistent with the known doctrine of the forerunner; whereas they urge that the simple communication to John of the substance of our Lord's discourse to Nicodemus is adequate explanation of the similarities between the two. It may be admitted that some subjective colouring from the apostle's own mind may have been transfused by him into his report of both discourses, which we cannot doubt (whatever may be said about the Galilaean ministry) were conducted in the Aramaic tongue. Weiss makes the pertinent suggestion that we cannot think that John the son of Zebedee beard the final testimony of the Baptist. It may easily have been communicated to the circle around Jesus by Andrew and some other disciple of the two masters. This may account for the appearance throughout the discourse of more Johannine language than usual. If we cannot, or may not, make these simple hypotheses, then we too should be disposed to think that the subjective element had so predominated as almost to hide the historic quality of the whole of this swanlike song of the Old Testament dispensation. But the hypotheses seem to be highly probable and extremely natural, and the coherence of the passage with what has gone before to be obvious and complete. The discourse contrasts the entire prophetic ministry with that of the Son of God (vers. 31, 32), which then sets forth the menus of appropriating the Divine gift of the Son of God (vers. 33-35), and predicts the awful issues of rejecting the supreme claims of the Divine Lord (ver. 36). The teaching is in accord with Old Testament doctrine, illumined, as we learn that John's was, by special visions, and by communications to him of the significance of the Lord's uttered words. It is quite irrelevant, if not absurd, to say that such a testimony of the forerunner makes the  cotinuance or spread of John's teaching and baptism impossible; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words were obviously addressed to a small group only of the many thousands who heard John preach, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it does not follow that all those who heard these memorable words should have deserted their first master, even in deference to his own advice. The words that follow, whether a simple record of John's discourse or one deeply coloured by the subjectivity of the evangelist, are as follows: - <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is coming from above is above all.</span> Now, it is obvious that Jesus had spoken of the Son of man as having come down from heaven (ver. 13), and of his own power to speak of heavenly things (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of causes and measures of Divine operations); and he contrasts these with the "earthly things" of which he too had spoken - "earthly" they were because they dealt with experiences felt and witnessed and realized on earth. Now, John is represented, on the occasion of the baptism of our Lord, as being convinced that Jesus was "the Son of God," and that his existence was prior to his own, and that his rank in the universe was one utterly transcending his own. These statements have been already put into the lips of John by the fourth evangelist, and are scarcely exceeded, if at all, by the utterance before us. We find a bold contrast between the Logos himself and the witness to the manifested Logos. <span class="accented">He who cometh from above</span>, being before John, and being, therefore, in his essential dignity, superior to him, <span class="accented">is above all</span>, and therefore above him. <span class="cmt_word">He that is,</span> in his origin and the entire self-realization of his life, <span class="cmt_word">from the earth</span>, and not incarnate Logos, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the earth</span> in quality, <span class="cmt_word">and speaketh of the earth</span> (observe, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> is here used). The experiences to which he refers are enacted on the earth, and he has no power to go back and heavenwards for the full explanation of them. Higher than heaven are the thoughts and revelations of the Son of God. He can unveil the heart of the eternal Father. Christ can link his own work with the ministry of the mightiest of the Heaven-sent messengers; but John starts from the consciousness, the perils, the self-deceptions and contrition of man. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that cometh out of heaven is above all.</span> This great utterance is repeated, and it involves little more than what John had implied to the Sanhedrin (<a href="../../par/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30-34</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32</a></div><div class="verse">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which he hath seen and heard, this he testifieth;</span> or, <span class="accented">beareth witness to.</span> His pre-existent glory with the Father makes him the adequate Witness to the heavenly things (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of which he hath authoritatively spoken; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eternal love of the Father, the purpose of the Son being sent into the world from the heart of God, and its ultimate issues - eternal life to the believer, and condemnation to those who love the darkness and do not believe. Westcott, who regards these words as the free reflections of the evangelist, thinks that reference is being made to the continued testimony of the Church as the voice of Christ; but the spirit of the passage is obscured by this interpretation. The living present vocal testimony of Christ is being throughout contrasted with that of John. <span class="cmt_word">And no man receiveth his witness.</span> This seems in direct antagonism to the language of the disciples, "All men come to him;" and to John's own language, "He must increase." Westcott regards it, again, as the melancholy reflection of the aged apostle towards the close of the century. This seems to me to be an inadequate explanation. The reception of the witness of Christ had moved the whole world when John wrote his Gospel; and it would be inconsistent with the tone of exhilaration with which the evangelist closes his work. The forerunner may, however, have used this strong expression in purposed contrast to the jealous language of his own followers. "No man" - in comparison with the multitudes who ought to have already accepted him as the Son of God, as the heavenly Bridegroom. The concourse who crowded to the baptism of Jesus for a little moment did not blind the Baptist to the persistent and malignant opposition which awaited Jesus. "His joy  (ver. 29) and his grief (ver. 32) both formed a noble contrast to the jealousy of his own disciples" (Meyer).

It may even mean more than this, viz. that in Jesus "all the promises of God are Yea and Amen," that God is true in himself, and the witness of Christ embraces all that for which prophecy and promise and previous revelation had prepared the way (see Luthardt and Westcott). Such an idea is certainly beyond the scope of John's ministry or message. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a></div><div class="verse">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <i>unto him</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> shows that the former utterance is sustained. <span class="cmt_word">For he whom God sent uttereth the words of God.</span> The full, many-sided, abundant expression of the thought of God.

The clause that follows (seeing that "<span class="accented">to</span> him" <span class="accented">is</span> unquestionably a gloss of translators, and is not found in any manuscripts) may be translated in three different ways. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">For God giveth not the Spirit by measure</span>; for if <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is omitted, still the same subject, "God," might be and is generally supplied, and the object, supposed to be either Christ or any of his servants to whom in these days of the baptism of the Spirit, the Holy Ghost is poured forth from an inexhaustible treasure. Augustine and Calvin urged that it was said concerning Christ; for we read in ver. 35 that "the Father hath given all things into his hand;" but exclusively to limit the object of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> to Christ is more than the passage will justify. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">For he</span> (the Messiah, <span class="accented">sc.</span>) <span class="accented">giveth not the Spirit by measure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. He</span> is exalted to pour forth from the heart of the Deity the Spirit of the Father and Son. This is preferred by Westcott, and by those who see in the entire passage the reflections of the author of the Gospel (cf. <a href="../../par/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">For the Spirit giveth not by measure</span>; the object (<span class="accented">sc.</span>) being "the words of God," which he who is sent and is coming from heaven, and is above all, is now lavishing upon the world. This translation (Godet) is in harmony with the vision of John at the baptism, when the Holy Spirit after the manner of a dove descended and abode upon him. With an unmeasurable supply of spiritual energy was the <span class="accented">humanity</span> of him who came (<span class="accented">qua</span> his Divine nature and personality) from heaven enriched for his prophetic and Messianic functions as the beloved Son of God on earth. I see no difficulty in this last interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The present tense is justified by the statement of the abiding of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus, and the continuous operation of the gift in the "words of God," which were flowing from his lips. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> is easily supplied in thought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The connection is thus instituted with the thirty-fifth verse. Meyer and Lange prefer a wider significance being given to the words, seeing in them a broad reference to the affluence and measureless capacity of the gift of the Spirit. Luthardt: "This is true of all God's messengers, but especially of him of whom the Baptist speaks" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-12</a>). The Lord from heaven receives all the gifts of the Spirit.

Bible (quoted by Hengstenberg) adds, to the great words, <span class="cmt_word">the Father loveth the Son,</span> "as I sufficiently learned from the voice at the Jordan" - <span class="cmt_word">and hath given all things into his hand.</span> The "all things" may he taken by us in their widest sense (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>) - "all <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in heaven and earth" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>;  <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>); and the power of determining the final condition of all souls, suggested in ver. 36. But we may conceive a less extended horizon limiting the vision of the Baptist: all things belonging to the kingdom of God, to the progress and consummation of it in the world. John need not be supposed to have swept onward into the eternal future, but mainly to have been thinking of the mutual relations of the forerunner and the Christ. The Son will determine the place of his herald and of his disciple. There is no limit expressed. He who had these matters entrusted to him might easily be supposed to have "all things in his hand." He rested the less upon the greater. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a></div><div class="verse">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life</span> (cf. here, vers. 16, 17; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>). These words, which above every other clause in this "swanlike song," are suffused with a glow that it is difficult to believe issued from the heart of the forerunner, unless we may make the supposition already referred to, that some of John's former disciples had carried to his earlier master the grand refrain of the discourse to Nicodemus. The entrusting of the soul in utter moral surrender to the Son of God, <span class="accented">is</span> life - eternal life. All cruel suspicions of God vanish when the veil is lifted which sin and the corruption of the human heart have hung over the holiest of all. John had passed into a new world when he discovered the true nature of the kingdom - the tempted, humbled, sacrificial, triumphant character of the Son of God. To believe on the Son is to have the life. <span class="cmt_word">But he that is disobedient to the Son.</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are, in the English Version, translated "believeth not," and again so in <a href="../../par/romans/11-30.htm">Romans 11:30</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> are used interchangeably. The word means one who is (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> distrustful, who refuses to be persuaded, is contumacious and expresses the opposite to faith in active exercise, who repudiates faith on its fiducial and practical side. Nothing is said of those who have had no opportunity of coming to a knowledge of the Son of God. Shall not see life; shall not even see so as to be able to conceive of, much less enjoy, life (Westcott; see ver. 3). There is a <span class="accented">blinding</span> power in disobedience, which prevents those who are actively hostile to the essential excellences and glories of Christ from even knowing what <span class="accented">life is. Life</span> is obviously here and elsewhere more than physical existence, or than its continuance, or than its resuscitation after death; it is the activity of the new spirit, the supernatural and eternal blessedness wrought by "birth of the Spirit." Nor is the calamity referred to a mere negation. John may be said here to have gone beyond the words of the Master in the previous discourse, and, moreover, it is in fiery earnestness that he speaks. <span class="cmt_word">The wrath of God,</span> which has already been called down upon him by his disobedience, <span class="cmt_word">abideth on him.</span> God's <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> had been spoken of by the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7</a>); and the term, wherever used, is far more than "the consuming fire of infinite love," into which many strive to resolve it. It represents active and terrible displeasure revealed from heaven (<a href="../../par/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>). Much of the wrath of the Lord is said to be temporary in its character (Wisd. 16:5 Wisd. 18:20); but this is abiding, and, so far as is here revealed, permanent. The most terrible expression in the New Testament is the "wrath of the Lamb" (<a href="../../par/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>). The last word of the Baptist, even in the Fourth Gospel, is a word of thunder, and he disappears from view when he has delivered this terrible condemnation on those who are wilfully, actively resisting that Son whom "the Father loves," and to whose hands he has "entrusted all things." The ministry of John is, after all, that of the Elijah, not that of the Christ. To the last word, even if the phraseology has been moulded in the Greek of the fourth evangelist into a closer resemblance to his own vocabulary, and if by his attempt to epitomize what may have taken hours to say in varied phrase, the apostle has unconsciously adopted some of his own favourite terms, yet the message flashes with the fire of the prophet of the wilderness; and men are threatened with the peril of abiding under the wrath of Almighty God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/4.htm"><title>John 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/3.htm" title="John 3">&#9668;</a> John 4 <a href="../john/5.htm" title="John 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-42.</span> - 7. <span class="accented">The ministry and revelation of the Lord to those beyond the strict compass of the theocracy.</span> This passage describes an incident of consummate interest, and records a specimen of our Lord's intercourse with individuals, and the reaction of that instruction upon the disciples. The event is a solitary chink through which the light of historical fact falls upon an otherwise darkened and unknown period of the Saviour's life. When we skirt a forest we see at intervals, where by some accident of growth the light falls upon a narrow space, a miniature world of life and loveliness of every kind, suggesting what might happen if every square yard of the forest could receive a similar illumination. Every day of that wondrous life of Christ may have been equally full of meaning to some souls. "These things are written, that we may believe that Jesus is the Son of God; and that believing we may have life." The relation of the Jews to the Samaritans gives a special character and both typical and symbolical meaning to the incident. The lifelike reality of the scene, the extreme unlikelihood of such an event having been fabricated with consummate art to establish any specific theological conclusion, the natural appropriateness of the transaction, all confer a high value and historicity upon this paragraph. Thoma, after the manner of Strauss, finds the origin of every detail in the story of Eliezer at the well; but there are no limits to what allegorists may dream, if the reins are thrown on the neck of imagination. The story of Philip's ministry in Samaria and the successes of the gospel in the early days of Christianity are also supposed to have aided the composition of the story. In our opinion, <a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a> is better explained from <a href="../../par/john/4.htm">John 4</a> than the reverse process. Baur's supposition, that the author sought to contrast the cautious hesitation of the Jewish doctor with the susceptible emotional disposition of the Samaritan woman as the representative of the Gentile world, is unreasonable. The woman is represented as a believer in Divine revelation and worship, in the early traditions of the Jews themselves, and even in their Messianic hopes, which, in this instance, were more spiritual than those of the Jews.  There are numerous debates as to the origin of the Samaritan nation, and opinions waver as to whether they were the descendants of those remnants of the kingdom of Israel who were left in the district once occupied by the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, after the final deportation under Shalmaneser (or Sargon, as the Assyrian inscriptions make probable), together with the heathen settlers who had been mixed up with them, or were solely and purely of Assyrian origin, as they appear to maintain (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>). The narrative of <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a> implies that all the inhabitants were carried away to cities of the Medes, but it is tolerably clear and eminently probable (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>) that there were some of the people left behind; so that the extent to which Israelitish blood and ideas prevailed in the mongrel race is very difficult to determine. We know that heathen notions of Jehovah, and the worship of graven images, were curiously blended (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-28.htm">2 Kings 17:28-41</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6, 7</a>). But this is only what might be anticipated if their moral and religious degeneration corresponded with the charges brought against them by Hosea and Amos. In the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, efforts on their part to share in the honours and independence of Judah were sternly interdicted, and the interdict avenged by angry recriminations which delayed the progress of reconstruction. The antagonism commenced then was deepened into a deadly rivalry by the erection of a temple to Jehovah on Mount Gerizim ( <span class="date">B.C. 409</span>), and by Manasseh, brother of the high priest of Judah, being driven from Jerusalem by his refusal to renounce Sanballat's daughter, and by his becoming high priest of the heretical temple. This temple on Gerizim, in close proximity with the site of Shechem, the abode of the first patriarchs, gave dignity and solidity to some of their traditions and claims; and the modifications they had introduced into the text of the Pentateuch in their celebrated version of it helped to aggravate the schism between the two peoples. The district of country was held during the quarrels of the Ptolemies and Seleucidae alternately by both. Samaritan hatred of the Jews led them to purchase peace during the cruel oppression of Judah under Antiochus Epiphanes, by dedicating their temple to Zeus (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05, 5), and again by siding with the Syrians against the Maccabees. Their temple was destroyed by John Hyrcanus,  <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>, and its ruins only were visible in the time of Christ. The city of Sebaste was built by Herod, on the site of the city of Samaria, and <span class="accented">Flavia Neapolis</span>, now called <span class="accented">Nablous</span>, was erected on the site or close neighbourhood of the ancient Shechem. There were mutual recriminations between Jews and Samaritans, which led to strained relations and fierce condemnation, and yet, strange to say, the rabbis did not treat the land as "unclean" (Edersheim, 'Life of Jesus the Messiah,' bk. 3, 100, 7), and consequently the disciples were not precluded from purchasing articles of food from the Samaritan village. They were the "foolish people," "abhorred" of devout Jews (Ecclus. 50, 25, 26); and Rabbi Chuda treated them as heathens, yet Simon ben Gamaliel regarded them as Israelites, and the 'Mishnah' shows that in many of their customs they resembled the Jews. It is doubtful whether they denied the resurrection, and it is certain that their principal tenets and practices were derived from the old revelation. The opposition was felt so strongly by some Jews in the northern province of Galileo that they travelled to Jerusalem through Persea in order to avoid it. Our Lord's treatment of Samaritans in this narrative seems at first sight inconsistent with <a href="../../par/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>, where the apostles are advised to avoid cities of the Samaritans on their first experimental journey. Still, there is a difference between Christ's "passing through" Samaria, on his way to Galilee, and his limiting the early proclamation of the kingdom to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel." The disciples were not then to be entrusted with a commission which, not until after Pentecost, they would fulfil with so much joy (<a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.). The success of Philip, Peter, and John may have been due to the first sowing of the heavenly seed by the Lord himself. That Christ should have chosen a woman of doubtful reputation from a semi-alien and accursed race to have received some of his greatest teaching (albeit there was no less an ear than John's at hand to record the  marvel) is akin to many of the mysteries of his life. Why, it is sometimes asked, did he not proclaim his sublimest thoughts in the schools or temple courts? Why did he confine them to Nicodemus and the Samaritaness? There is no reason to compel us to any such conclusion. The simple fact before us is full justification of the belief that on many another occasion as well as on this, he uttered like things. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The contrast between Jewish unsusceptibility and Samaritan pre-disposition to faith.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - When therefore the Lord  - a few occasions are found in the Gospels where this appellative, without any proper name, is used for Jesus (<a href="../../par/john/6-23.htm">John 6:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-2.htm">John 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/17-5.htm">Luke 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-61.htm">Luke 22:61</a>), and on these occasions some special suggestion is made of the Divine rank and personality of Jesus - <span class="cmt_word">knew that the Pharisees heard;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were taking notice, after their wont, with secret machination and with open hostility, of the course which he was pursuing. The treatment which John the Baptist received at their hands was pointedly referred to by our Lord on two occasions (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-12.htm">Matthew 17:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23-32</a>). They did not believe in John's baptism. The publicans and harlots had repented and pressed into the kingdom before them. This "generation" did whatever it listed to the Elias. Therefore we judge that Herod's persecution, stimulated by his guilty passions, was assisted by "the offspring of vipers." They had probably broken up the baptismal enthusiasm of the multitudes, and aided Herod to shut up John in the castle of Machearus, and hence their present "hearing" meant immediate and hostile action. Jesus had left the temple, and retired to the courts and homes and neighbourhood of Jerusalem; and then was only visited at night by solitary men, who ought to have come in crowds. He left Jerusalem itself for some point in Judaean territory, and there continued for a season the preparatory call for repentance and conversion. The extraordinary success of Jesus at this period excited the special attention of the Pharisees. The matter that came to their ears was that <span class="cmt_word">Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John.</span> In other words, they heard of an extraordinary wave of popular excitement, yet of nothing answering to the Baptist's imagination of what ought to have taken place. John's ideas corresponded more closely than the teaching of Jesus did with the tenets and methods of the Pharisees. We find that the disciples of John are coupled with Pharisees in the matter of fasting (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a> and parallel passages), yet that John's preaching and baptism were distasteful to the Pharisees. <span class="accented">A fortiori</span> the baptism of Jesus would be still more offensive, for it was doubtless accompanied by more searching demands. It had invaded the temple precincts, it had advanced more conspicuous personal claims. John said, "I am come to prepare the way of the Lord;" Jesus said, "I am come down from heaven." (<span class="cmt_word">Although</span> (<span class="accented">and yet</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Jesus himself</span> (in person) <span class="cmt_word">baptized not, but his disciples</span> performed the act.) This parenthetical clause, explanatory of the statement of <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>, as well as of the previous verse, is justified on the simple ground that Jesus baptized with the Spirit, and not with water. For him to baptize into his own name would have been to darken the mystery; for him to baptize into One who should come would in a way have hidden the fact that he had come. The administration of the rite by the few disciples who were with him would preserve all the symbolism of the new observance. We have no repetition of this statement, nor the faintest hint that the apostles continued this Johannine ceremonial. Moulton and some others lay emphasis on the present; tenses, "makes and baptizes," and therefrom argue that the ministry of John had not yet been brought to a termination, that John was not yet cast into prison, and that the journey into Galilee does not correspond with that described in <a href="../../par/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4</a>, but thai; our Lord removed from Judaea simply to avoid the apparent rivalry between the two baptismal and evangelistic ministries. When Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard, etc., he resolved upon a new and startling course.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-3.htm">John 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee</span>. But it should be observed that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> is a very peculiar word for a simple departure. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> is used when <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> might have been expected (Westcott). The word means "to leave a thing to itself," to its own ways, to treat it as no longer exercising an influence on the mind. (It is, with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, used for "forgive," "forgiveness," of sins.) Jesus left Judaea, which had so imperfectly accepted his claims. The word suggests that his departure was a consequence of the action of the Pharisees; <span class="accented">And he departed again.</span> This refers to the first departure  after the early testimonies of John, when Jesus went to Cana and Capernaum (<a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>). Whether this journey corresponded with that mentioned in Matthew and Mark, as following the baptism and temptation of Jesus, or not, it is not to be confounded with the journey which John had already recorded. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">And he must needs go through Samaria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he must needs go through Samaria.</span> There was no physical necessity about it. He might, as bigoted Jews were accustomed to do, have crossed the Jordan and passed through Peraea instead. There was no such animus in the heart of Jesus, and a Divine and providential monition was the occasion of his taking the direct road. Geikie has drawn a vivid picture of the difficulties to which Jewish travellers on the borders of Samaria were exposed (see <a href="../../par/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:06. 1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:12. 4; 'Vit.,' 52), and also of the physical features of the land. Samaria, as a name of the small district of central Palestine, arose from the name of the city "Samaria," built by Omri, and made the site of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), and that of the Baal- and of the calf-worship. Samaria suffered from the siege, and the city was depopulated by Shalmanezer (Sargon), and colonized with Assyrians under Esarhaddon. It was destroyed by Hyrcanus, and rebuilt in splendour by Herod the Great, and by him dedicated to Augustus, and called <span class="accented">Sebaste</span> after him. Though Shechem (equivalent to Sichem) was the more famous site, and overshadowed Herod's city by its historical interest, yet "Samaria" was the name which has survived all others, and covered a larger space. Jesus was probably on the borders of Samaria, in the Judaean country, before he commenced his journey. Samaria was included in the tetrarchy of Archelaus, and formed part of the province under the pro-curatorship of Pontius Pilate; while Herod Antipas reigned over Galilee and Persia. The Lord was fulfilling the Divine will, in commencing his Galilaean ministry, in leaving Judaea proper for the present, and passing through Samaria. It is worthy of notice that John here attributes to "the Pharisees," rather than "the Jews," the opposition which indicated the wisdom or necessity of this course.

The similarity of the names Sychar and Sichem led many to suppose that John confounded either the names or the places. Those who were anxious to undervalue the accuracy of the author have attributed it to mistake. Schenkel still sees the error of a Gentile Christian. Others have supposed that the word meaning "town of drunkards" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>), or "town of liars" <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), was intentionally applied by John to <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or that some provincial pronunciation of the name of the old city had thus been commemorated. Hengstenberg suggested that Sychar was a suburb of Siehem or Shechem, and Robinson placed the latter much nearer to Jacob's welt than the present <span class="accented">Nablous.</span> Tholuck gave a philosophical solution - that <span class="accented">m</span> and <span class="accented">r</span> in the two words, being <span class="accented">liquids</span>, were interchanged; and Meyer at one time held that John simply applied the vulgar name. Jerome ('Quaest. Web. in <a href="../../par/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.') said it was a corruption of the name Sichem. But Eusebius discriminated Shechem from Sychar in his 'Onomasticon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; and a place called <span class="accented">Sochar</span> or <span class="accented">Sichra</span> is mentioned, and also its "well," in the Talmud. Delitzsch ('Zeitsehrift flit Luth. Theol.,' 1856) has quoted seven passages which refer to the place as the birthplace of rabbis, and as having been alternately occupied by Jews and Samaritans. Moreover, in late years, Palestine explorers have found, within <span class="accented">half a mile</span> of Jacob's well, a village, <span class="accented">El</span> '<span class="accented">Askar</span>, preserving to the present day the old name. Nor has the name been in late years drawn from this narrative and given to this insignificant village, for a Samaritan chronicle, dating from the twelfth century, preserves the name as <span class="accented">Iskar. A priori</span> it is far more probable that a woman of Sychar, than one of Shechem, should have come to draw water, in consequence of the nearer proximity of the former "city" than of the latter to Jacob's well. It is further characterized <span class="cmt_word">as near to the parcel of ground</span>  <span class="cmt_word">which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span> In <a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> (LXX.); <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, we see that Jacob's treaty with the sons of Humor, and the summary violence of his sons in punishment of Dinah's dishonour, were treated by him as giving him special possession in Shechem (the LXX., in <a href="../../par/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>, have translated the word for "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, erroneously supposing that the word was a proper name, instead of an allusive play on the word "Shechem"), and he solemnly bequeathed it to Joseph. In <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a> we find the bones of Joseph were deposited there. (Knobel translates <a href="../../par/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> as the portion which he, Jacob, (by his sons) <span class="accented">would</span> win (not had won) with sword and bow.) Geiger, 'Urschrift.,' p. 80 (referred to by Edersheim<span class="accented">, i.e.</span>, 1:404), shows that St. John's interpretation of Genesis is perfectly in harmony with rabbinic tradition.

To the present day this indubitable site goes by both names. This district abounds in springs (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>), and the digging of this deep well was a work of supererogation, such as might be performed by a stranger in the land. The well is indeed fed by fountains of water in the neighbourhood. It has been known as Jacob's well by a continuous tradition, and is situated in the plain of Mukhhan, under the rough sides of Gerizim, just beyond the spot where the plain is entered almost at right angles by the eastern end of the vale of Shechem. The latter vale is constituted by the two mountain ridges of Gerizim on the south and Ebal on the north. Nablous, or Shechem, is not visible from the well of Sychar, being hidden by the spur of Gerizim from view, and higher up the valley of Shechem are the present ruins of Sebastich or Samaria proper. Dean Stanley said it was one of the most beautiful spots in Palestine. Sychar lies half a mile to the north of the traditional well. The well, two hundred years ago, was declared by Maundrell to be a hundred and five feet deep, and built of solid masonry. In 1866 Lieutenant Anderson found it seventy-five feet deep, and quite dry. It is nine or ten feet in diameter; and it is one of the most indubitable spots where we may feel certain that the feet of the blessed Lord have trod. Efforts are now being made by the Palestine Exploration Society to protect and restore the well. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore, being wearied</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> is "to labour unto weariness," from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, exhausting toil) <span class="cmt_word">with his journey.</span> A long, exhausting march told upon him, and he felt the weakness of our humanity. Thoma suggests that, because the woman that Jacob found at the well was Rachel, the mother of Joseph, the Samaritans' special patriarch, and because Leah was the mother of Levi and Judah, and her name means "wearied," so Jesus is represented as weary with his journey unto the home of Rachel! It is far more important to notice that the author of this Gospel, whose main idea was that Jesus is "the only begotten Son of the Father," "the Word made flesh," yet impresses upon us continually his realization of the full humanity, the definite, concrete human existence of Jesus. His life was no phantasm of the imagination, no mere docetic manifestation, as the Tubingen school attribute to the Johannine Christ, but veritable man. This Gospel alone records his presence and miracle at Cana, his travel-worn sympathy with our weakness, his making clay with spittle, his weeping over the grave of a friend, his thirst upon the cross, the blood that issued from his wounded side, and the obvious physical reality of his risen body, and thus furnishes the Church with the grounds on which the apostle maintained his Divine humanity. <span class="accented">Jesus <span class="cmt_word"></span>was seated thus</span> - or, <span class="accented">sat thus</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wearied, exhausted - <span class="cmt_word">on the well;</span> or on the low parapet of the well, which protected its mouth, he sat there comparatively, if not quite, alone. The position of the word "thus" after "sat" would, in classic Greek, make the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> mean "simply, without other preoccupation;" but there is no logical reason to deprive the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of its full meaning (Hengstenberg). The Lord, taking his seat by this memorable spot, rich in varied associations, becomes at once a type of the richer and diviner supply of life which he is able and ready to dispense to mankind. The weariness and waiting of the Lord at the well was a sublime hint of the exhaustless supply of grace which was ever flowing from the broken heart of the Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">It was</span> <span class="cmt_word">about the sixth hour</span>. The author is remarkable for his repeated mention of the hours at which some of the most memorable crises of his life took place, and thus gives a vivid impression of reality and of the presence of the eyewitness. He must himself have waited by the side of the Lord, and overheard the conversation which followed, just as he did the conversation with Nicodemus. Great difference of opinion prevails as to his method of computing time; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he adopted the Jewish computation, from sunrise to sunset into twelve variable hours, or the Roman method of computation, from  midnight to midday, from noon to midnight, into twelve hours of equal length. Some difficulties are reduced by the latter hypothesis (see M'Clellan and Westcott, 'Additional Notes to <a href="../../par/john/19.htm">John 19</a>;' Edersheim, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>, 1:405; Moulton, <span class="accented">in loco</span>; Townson, 'Discourses of the Four Gospels,' p. 215). The hour referred to would then be <span class="accented">about</span> six o'clock in the evening, the very time when purchases would be made, and when women are in the habit of drawing water. The difficulty that presents itself is the brevity of the time remaining for all that happens as described in vers. 27-38, broad daylight being almost presupposed in ver. 35. Still, if "about the sixth hour" was five o'clock, even in January there would be possible time for the conversation, for the return of the disciples, and also for the approach of the Samaritans; though it must be remembered that twilight in Palestine is very brief, and that the whole narrative suggests the idea of leisure rather than hurried converse. If the Roman method of interpretation were adopted, the sixth hour <span class="accented">might</span> mean six o'clock in the morning, which was the hour intended, if the Roman computation <span class="accented">must</span> be supposed in <a href="../../par/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>. This suggestion has further difficulties. The weariness of the Lord at that early hour would imply a long journey before daybreak, which is extremely improbable (see <a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>). Besides, though Townson and M'Clellan lay emphasis on this Roman computation of time in Asia Minor, and advance some proof of it, yet some of their authorities are far from proving it. Luthardt says we have no right to suppose that John would deviate from the current Jewish computation. "About the sixth hour" would therefore mean "about noon," the very time when it is so common to rest after a morning journey. Lucke, Meyer, Hengstenberg, Godet, Lange, Schaff, Geikie, Watkins, all press the same interpretation of the words. Lucke justly says that there is no hint of the Lord and his disciples intending to remain by the well, but to pursue their journey after rest and food. This is inconsistent with the idea of an evening halt.

Besides, that city was at much too great a distance to be the home of this Samaritaness. There were other springs still nearer to the city of Sychar, which the women of the place would frequent. We need not, with Hengstenberg, suppose that, from a religious motive, one of reverence for the well of Jacob, this woman had chosen the longer walk and greater exertion, in the heat of the day. No hint of the kind occurs. The simple supposition that her home was hard by the well is sufficient to explain the somewhat unusual circumstance that she should have come alone and at midday. No longer, as in ancient times, did women of social position perform this duty (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>). She by her action proclaimed her humble station in life. Hard work is performed by women at the present day in the East and South. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.</span> This form of expression is not uncommon. The Lord was not only weary, but veritably thirsty. He had taken upon himself all our innocent desires and cravings. "He would know all, that he might succour all," and was intent upon conferring a blessing by asking a favour. He put it into her power to do him a kindness, just as when God evermore says, "Give me thy heart," when he is yearning to give himself to us. "It is more blessed to give than to receive." He will at once confer on this poor "waif and stray" the unspeakable privilege of bestowing the cup of cold water on the Lord of all. It is not that in the first instant he implied that he was thirsting for her salvation; that interpretation would almost lift the narrative into the purely symbolic region, greatly to its injury, and to the damage of the entire Gospel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For his disciples had departed into the city to buy food.</span> This is stated as a reason why he asked water from the chance wayfarer, who had obviously with her the "water pot" and the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 11), a word used for the rope with which the bucket or water jar was let down into the well. There are very discordant statements as to the degree of separation which the Jews insisted upon between themselves and Samaritans. The later rabbis greatly aggravated the feeling. They refused to eat the bread of Samaritans, as though it were more defiling than swine's flesh; objected to drink their wine or vinegar; and, if this animosity at the time of Christ had been equally pronounced, would have limited the disciples in their choice of food to uncooked eggs, fruits, and vegetables, and possibly to meal and wine. But it seems, from the earlier rabbinical books (Edersheim quotes several, which modify Lightfoot's authorities), that the meat of a Samaritan was lawful food if an Israelite had witnessed its killing, and that their bread, wine, etc., were not forbidden. We see no reason for thinking that Jesus was left absolutely alone on this occasion,  and, from John's habitual method of avoiding direct mention of himself, it becomes perfectly possible that he was there listening silently to all these gracious words. Moulton cannot doubt that the beloved disciple subsequently received the whole from the Lord's own lips; but there is no reason to conclude that he must have been absent, and very much to suggest his quiet presence (Weiss, 'Life of Christ,' 2:34). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, How is it (compare this "how" with that of Nicodemus. Jesus had at once provoked inquiry, which he was not unwilling to gratify) - How is it that thou, being a Jew? She would have known that he was a Jew by his speech, for the Samaritans were accustomed to turn the sound of <span class="accented">sh</span> into that of <span class="accented">s</span>; and so, when Jesus said in Jewish Aramaic, <span class="accented">Teni lishekoth</span>, "Give me to drink," while she would herself have said, <span class="accented">Teni lise-koth</span>, his speech would betray him. Again, the contour of the Jewish face differs greatly from that of the Samaritan, and the customary fringes on their robes were of different national colours. Moreover, his appearance, travel stained, weary, and thirsty, on the great highway between Galilee and Judaea, would have suggested at once that he was no Samaritan. <span class="cmt_word">Askest drink from me, who am a Samaritan, and a woman, too?</span> Already this was a startling puzzle, for her experience so far had only shown her that <span class="cmt_word">Jews have no dealings</span> (a word only once and here used in the New Testament) <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">Samaritans</span>. Most commentators suppose that this is an explanatory remark of the evangelist, pointing to the absence, in a hostile and haughty spirit, of all pleasant relations between the peoples (see note at commencement of chapter). We are not compelled to this conclusion. The words may just as likely have been the pert, half-ironical tone of the woman, who was drawing a contrast between the current profession of Israelites and the request which the need of Jesus had extorted (Moulton). The eighth verse had just said that the disciples had clearly some dealings with Samaritans, and had gone to purchase food at Sychar, taking with them the apparatus used for drawing water. This last fact is the evangelist's reason for introducing the remark of the woman. He would hardly have made it himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">The living water offered and misunderstood.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou hadst known the gift of God</span> (but thou dost not; - this conclusion is involved in the form of the conditional sentence), <span class="cmt_word">and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink.</span> Many suggestions are offered as to the meaning here of the "gift of God." Elsewhere (<a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>) Christ is himself God's Gift, and St. Paul speaks of Christ as God's unspeakable Gift (Hengstenberg). Paul also declares that "the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ." The living water, the refreshing, life-giving stream of blessedness which Christ is opening in this wilderness, is the meaning put back by some into these memorable words as they first fell from the lips of Jesus. So Lampe and Godet. But Augustine and others point to <a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>, where John tells us that the living water of which Jesus speaks as welling up like a river in the heart of a believer, in the bosom of one who has come to him to slake his otherwise quenchless thirst, is "the Spirit," which those who believe on him should receive when Jesus would be glorified. This sublime renewal of the greatest gift of God by the Spirit is set forth under similar imagery in <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> and <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>. However, words are functions of two minds; what they must or might have meant to her must have been Christ's meaning when he uttered them. The explanatory clause, <span class="accented">Who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink</span>, solves the perplexity. That the Son of God, that the Logos in flesh, should have so emptied himself of his eternal glory as to ask for water from a Samaritan, and a woman, is in itself a gift, the supreme gift, of God. She did not know the fulness of his nature. So Lange, Grotius, and others. A remark by Dr. Yeomans is singularly suggestive: "The context shows that 'the gift of God' is a gift which God had already given, rather than one yet held in reserve - the <span class="accented">actual gift</span> of his condescension, rather than the offered gift of living water, or the Holy Ghost." Had she known it and put the two thoughts together in the rudest fashion, she would have known the gift of God, and she would have become the suppliant at once and he the Giver. <span class="cmt_word">Thou wouldest have asked</span> (prayed, taken the position of the inferior) <span class="cmt_word">of him, and he would have given to thee living water</span>. (For the phrase, "living water," see <a href="../../par/genesis/26-19.htm">Genesis 26:19</a>; and for its application, <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>.) The Divine supply of heaven-sent life, which will slake all thirst for lesser gifts, and which will constitute the perennial blessedness of saved and glorified spirits. The gift of God is the full discovery of personal relations with the veritable Source of all life. This becomes life eternal as it leads to knowledge of the only God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent; and assists a full realization of the life,  the Source and End of which are God. It is interesting to notice that Philo, in many places, declares these wells of water (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a>) to mean "true philosophy or wisdom, deep and only with difficulty drawn upon." "Flowing water is the Logos himself, 'cisterns' represent memories of past knowledge;" but the Old Testament usage quoted above is a far more rational justification of the language used by our Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-11.htm">John 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The answer of the woman shows that, though startled as Jesus meant her to be by his self-assertion, she had not moved out of the limited region of her own thoughts - her physical thirst, her daily needs, and common appliances for meeting them. There is a touch of humour for this light-hearted creature in the contrast between the large offer and the apparent helplessness of the Offerer. God's folly is compared with man's wisdom; God's weakness is set over against man's strength. <span class="cmt_word">Sir</span> (my master - a phrase here of simple courtesy, yet showing some advance on what had gone before, "Thou being a Jew"), <span class="cmt_word">neither hast thou the vessel to draw with, and,</span> moreover, <span class="cmt_word">the well is deep</span> (see above on ver. 6). The water of this well cannot be lifted without an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and, when the water is reached, it is still open to question whether it be living, flowing water or not. <span class="cmt_word">Whence then hast thou the living water</span> of which thou hast spoken?

By rising up behind the family of Ephraim to the father of Judah as well as of Joseph, the woman claims a kind of kinship with Jesus. The "our" in this case is not a monopoly of the honours of Jacob for herself and her people. Her national pride is softening under the glance of the great Son of David, and she has a growing sense of the claims and dignity of the Person she is addressing, though her thought is couched in words that may be ironical. This was the kind of challenge which our Lord never refused to honour. Just as on other occasions he claimed to be "greater than the temple," and "Lord of the sabbath," and "before Abraham," and "greater than Moses, Solomon," or "Jonas," so here he quietly admits that he is indeed greater than "our father Jacob." The lifelike reality of the scene is evidenced in the alertness and feminine loquacity of the final clause (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are "cattle," not "servants," as seen in passages quoted by Meyer from Xenophon, Plato, Josephus, etc.). The nomadic condition of the first fathers of this race is brilliantly touched off by the sentence.

They will experience neither continuity nor completeness of enjoyment, but periods of incessant and recurrent desire. Jesus speaks of a Divine and complete satisfaction. The spiritual thirst once slaked, the heavenly desire once realized by appropriating the gift of God, is fundamentally satisfied. The nature itself is changed. How closely this corresponds with the idea of birth into a new world! and how nearly akin to the promise of living water in <a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>, etc. (see also the language of <a href="../../par/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>)! But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water leaping up (welling, bubbling up and forth) into eternal life. This is the explanation of the full satisfaction of desire. I do not give a simple "drink of water," but I cause a spring, a perennial fountain, a river of Divine pleasure to issue and flow from that inward satisfaction which follows a reception of my gifts; and it is so abundant that it is enough foreverlasting needs. The water that I give becomes a fountain, and the fountain swells into a river, and the river expands into and loses itself in the great ocean of eternity. The beauty of the image is lost if, with Luthardt and Moulton, we attach the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is not elsewhere applied to water, and this use of it gives the metaphor all the more force). The imagery is not without its difficulty. We are tempted to conclude from it that the Divine life, once given, becomes consciously a self-dependent force within the soul; but this would not be justified by all the analogy of the Divine working in humanity, which, though abundant, efficacious, and satisfying, never repudiates its Divine  source, but continually proclaims it. If the desire for what God alone can supply is eager and quenchless, and if God meet the craving, then the desire is absolutely satisfied. There is a superfluous fulness in the girt of God which will transcend all the needs of this life, and be enough for eternity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-15.htm">John 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The woman has not yet emerged out of the region of her physical desires and her daily requirements, and needs a deeper apprehension of her real necessities. By reason of the subsequent narrative she ought not to be credited now with impertinence or irony (Lightfoot, Tholuck). She could not understand the miraculous water of which the Stranger spake, but had some dim notion that he might be able to deliver her from her toilsome and exhausting life. She replies to him, <span class="cmt_word">Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</span> The Lord had spoken of eternal life, and she is content to have temporal satisfaction to the extent of thirsting no more. Some commentators, with Lange and Hengstenberg, suppose that the journey to Jacob's well was in her mind a quasi-religious act, the insufficiency of which to meet her case is at length becoming apparent. This view seems to us inconsistent with the sudden change of metaphor and alteration of his method of approach to this woman's consciousness and need. He resolved rather to search her heart and reveal her to herself - to bring forth from its hiding place the torpid conscience, and reveal to her the grievous need in which she stood of that Divine cleansing, healing, nutrition, refreshment, which he had been sent into the world to supply. This reflection renders the reply of Jesus less obscure than its abrupt transition seems to imply. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-16.htm">John 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="accented">The heart-searching issuing in perception of the prophetic rank of Jesus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - [<span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span>] <span class="cmt_word">saith unto her, fie, call thy husband, and come hither.</span> Our Lord, by that Divine penetration and thought reading which the evangelist attributes to him (ch. 2), knew exactly what manner of woman this was, and wished to bring her secret sins to the light of her own conscience. The demand touched her heart at its most tender place, and was indeed a partial answer to her prayer, "Give me this water." Conviction of sin is the beginning of the great work of the Paraclete; it will end in full assurance of faith (so Neander, Stier, Tholuck, Luthardt, Weiss, and Edersheim). Numerous have been the explanations of the Saviour's demand, but none of them so congruous as this: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Lucke supposes that Christ would have the husband share in the bounty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Meyer suggests that the Lord, by proving to her his prophetic glance in a region she could verify, was preparing her for similar confidence in himself in a higher and more momentous region. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg makes it part of his curious, mystical interpretation of the entire narrative, and by "husband" thinks that Jesus meant the true Lord and Husband of the kingdom of God, in contrast to the heathen lordships and polluting idolatries which Samaritans had blended with their Jehovism (of which more in the next verse). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Lange has supposed that Jesus here conforms to law and custom with reference to the superior claim of the husband, and declares that the wife must submit to it in receiving the gift of the kingdom of God; and Godet says, "Jesus did not wish to influence a dependent person without the participation of the man with whom she was united." Jesus surely never waits upon conventionalisms, sabbatic rules, current fashions of any kind; and some deeper reason than this is more than apparent from the startling response. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The woman answered, and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou said correctly, Husband have I none: for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. This true thing hast thou spoken.</span> The woman resists the description which Jesus assumes that she bears to the man with whom she stands in illegal relations. Convinced, brought to bay, she cannot lie to Jesus. She says, in penitence and shame, "I have no husband." There is no concealment of the fact; she must need the cleansing of the life-giving stream. Jesus, not without a tone of solemn remonstrance, accuses her of a life of loose morals. It is implied that the first five husbands were conventionally allowable; but the suggestion is that, either by divorce or wanton rushing to further nuptials if the former had been ruptured by death, her character had been ever deteriorating until, under present circumstances, she was committing an overt act of illegality and impurity. "In saying thou hast no husband, thou hast spoken to the point, and for the reasons I recite thou hast made a true statement." As the woman in ver. 27 tells her friends "He told me all things that ever I did," we may easily believe that she felt, under his searching glance, that no folly, no weakness, no rebellious deed, no damning compromise, was hidden from him. How much more he said we can only conjecture. The revelation thus recorded is akin to other events in our Lord's life, which we cannot account for by the supposition that information  concerning her had been conveyed by some rumour which thus he flashed upon her. This would suffer from the intolerable supposition that his claim to have prophetic light was a self-conscious fraud, and that by such a subterfuge the entire Samaritan mission had been characterized and controlled. Lunge thought that the definite traces of the five marriages were in some mysterious fashion hieroglyphed upon her face. This is a great extravagance of the working of natural law, to avoid the supernatural perception which our Lord exercised whenever he chose to draw upon the inexhaustible resources and powers at his disposal. Hengstenberg ('Contributions to Genuineness of the Pentateuch,' and in his 'Commentary'), while he recognizes the historical fact here mentioned and penetrated by our Lord, considered that there was a twofold meaning in our Lord's reply. Thou hast had five husbands; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there were five gods - those of Cuthah, Babylon, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 9:14, 3; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>), whose worship by spiritual adultery the Samaritan people (of which you are a representative) have tolerated, and HE, Jehovah, whom thou now hast by surreptitious claim, is not thy covenanted Lord. Unfortunately, this too ingenious interpretation fails, first of all in this, that to the five nations <span class="accented">seven</span> gods are reckoned (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-30.htm">2 Kings 17:30, 31</a>). Again, it is inconceivable that the worship of Jehovah should be represented as on a par with these idolatries, and that Jehovah himself should be set forth as the sixth and worst of the theocratic husbands of the Samaritan state. Nor can we suppose that Christ, who said such wondrous things about the spirituality and the love of God to man, and was in the same breath about to utter one of the grandest of them, should thus have poured contumely on the Samaritan worship of Jehovah. Thoma practically adopts Hengstenberg's speculative interpretation. Strauss (1st and 2nd edit. 'Leb. Jes.') made use of Hengstenberg's admission to find in the whole narrative a mythical fiction; and Keim has only made matters worse by ascribing the entire narrative to the unknown author of the Fourth Gospel. Christ's own Divine penetration revealed the woman to herself, and she knew how hateful her life must have been in his sight. She made no attempt at denial, or concealment, or self-justification. The events referred to had burnt themselves on her memory, and her only refuge is in a bold admission of the right of the unknown Stranger to teach. She concedes his claim to solve perplexities, and penetrate other mysteries as well as the depths of her own heart.

The Samaritans accepted the books of Moses, and did not adopt the teaching of the historical or prophetical books, on which the Jews had built up their exaggerated and carnal views of the Messiah and his kingdom. They were not anticipating a King, but a "Prophet like unto Moses." They placed the great Prophet above the King, as a peer of their legislature, and as superior to their rabbis and priests. The sense of standing in the presence of One who looked down into human hearts, justified her in putting the great case of her people and her own sins before him. Let him speak further. Peradventure he will set the relative claims of Zion and Gerizim at rest, so far as approach to the Holy One is concerned. More than ordinary candour was required to make the admission that a Jew might decide the agelong controversy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our fathers.</span> The "our" refers here to the Samaritans, just as the "ye" does to the Jews. She may be going back once more to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who worshipped and laboured at Shechem - but the mountain itself was not the site of a temple until the days of Nehemiah, and the temple in which the apostate Manasseh, son of Jaddua, offered sacrifices had been destroyed for nearly a hundred and fifty years. A chronological, if not more serious, difference is apparent between Nehemiah and Josephus (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 11:08. 2; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-28.htm">Nehemiah 13:28</a>). According to the former, the Samaritan schism which led to the erection of the temple was a hundred years before the period assigned by Josephus. For whereas Nehemiah says that the apostate priest whom he chased away was son-in-law of Sanballat, the Persian satrap in Samaria, Josephus makes Sanballat contemporary with Alexander, and represents the establishment of the Samaritan temple as originating with his approval. Josephus further ('Ant.,' 13:09, 1) says that the temple was destroyed by Hyrcanus, about  <span class="date">B.C. 129</span>, and adds that it had stood two hundred years. The temple was destroyed, but "the mountain of blessing" remained for the Samaritans as a place of prayer ('Ant.,' 18:04. 1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:02, 6). This was conserved, on the ground that Abraham and Jacob had here built altars (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-13</a>). In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>, however, Mount Ebal in mentioned as the place where an altar had been first built to Jehovah. In the Samaritan Pentateuch the word "Gerizim" had in this place been substituted for "Ebal;" and so it came to pass that Gerizim had been a place of prayer throughout the long interval When Jesus  was at Jacob's well, he could see the ruins of the edifice where sacrifice and praises were being offered. Indeed, these have continued to the present day. The oldest shrine in the world for local worship still holds its own, hard by the very spot where the most complete overthrow of the principle of sacred places fell in divinest words from the lips of the Holy One. Our fathers <span class="cmt_word">worshipped in this mountain</span> - Gerizim, where the ruins of the temple still abide - <span class="cmt_word">and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.</span> Jerusalem is not mentioned in their sacred books - Jerusalem, whose unity of sanctuary was recognized at length as the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> where the Lord would put his Name, and where alone the sacrifices could possess their historic and symbolic validity. Whensoever the Pentateuch may have been finally edited, all critics will allow that, at the time of the Lord, and in the Samaritan Version of the Pentateuch, the idea of such unity of sanctuary was a fixed principle. The Samaritans claimed Gerizim, and the Jews Moriah, as the place where Abraham offered his typical <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, and both regarded the worship celebrated in their favourite shrine - the daily offering, the annual feasts (the Passover especially) - as giving worthiness to all the prayers and praises which they might be induced to offer in all places where they might sojourn. The woman does not submit to our Lord that he may settle this great question for her, but she makes it clear enough that she would like to know his verdict. The worship was the sacrificial worship where sin such as hers could alone be cleansed, and where her conscience could be set free for calm and continuous communion with God.

The Divine order which links the events of God's providence together, has not made it possible as yet in its fulness, as it will do when the revelation is complete, but the hour is drawing near, <span class="cmt_word">when neither in this</span> <span class="cmt_word">mountain,</span> <span class="cmt_word">nor in Jerusalem, will ye worship the Father</span>. Christ did not say that either Samaritans or Jews were exclusively right in their preference for one local shrine or place of sacrificial worship; but he declared the sublime truth that the worship of the Father would soon prove itself to be independent of both alike and of all the limitations of place and ceremony. Every place would be as sacred and as hallowed as these notable shrines, when the full character and real nature of the object of worship became fully known. <span class="accented">The Father</span> was a name for God not unknown to Jew or Gentile; but so overlaid, suspected, defamed, forgotten, that the emphasis which Jesus laid upon it came with the force of a new revelation of God's relation to man. Man is born in the image of God, and partakes of the nature and essence of the Supreme Being, and it is in God's true nature and veritable relations with men that he will be eventually adored. When Christ speaks of "my Father" he refers to the specialty of revelation of the fatherhood in his own incarnation. The Father was only partially known in and by all the dispensations of nature and grace, but he was especially revealed in the whole of the prolonged series of facts and symbols and prophetic teachings which constituted the religion of Israel; and Christ will not allow this great revelation of the Father to pass unaccredited or to be ignored by one whom he essays to teach.

"That which" points to the essence and inner character of the object of their worship. They gave him a name, but they were comparatively ignorant of, and confessedly hostile as a people to, the revelation that the Father had made. They fell back on a past of rigid orthodoxy but of limited range. They rejected every portion of the Old Testament with the exception of the Pentateuch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the entire historical treatment of the primeval faith; even that very essence of it which involved the progressive and expanding conception of the character of God - the perpetuity and continuous renovation of relations, the prophetic insight into providence, the sublime liturgy of a ceaseless worship, the prediction of a Messianic glory which, in the fulness of the times, should complete and complement all that preceded. They were, by their prejudices and hostility, kept ignorant of and unacquainted with the Name that was above every name. In  contradistinction from this, we Jews, to whom as a nation you rightly conclude I belong, and as a representative of whom I speak - <span class="cmt_word">We worship that which we know.</span> Christ in this place, more distinctly perhaps than in any portion of the four Gospels, places himself as a worshipper side by side with his hearers. Here, moreover, he identifies himself with the Jews - becomes their interpreter and mouthpiece and representative. When a question arises, which of the two has the larger amount of truth, Jew or Gentile, Jew or Samaritan, he pronounced in stringent terms in favour of the Jew. The revelation advancing beyond the narrow limitations of Samaritan nationality as to place, and time, and historic fact, with its pregnant ritual, has revealed the Father to us Jews, in <span class="cmt_word">this</span> <span class="cmt_word">respect and because the salvation</span> of which Moses partly dreamed, but which has been the burden of every prophecy and psalm - the "salvation" which gives meaning to all our knowledge, <span class="cmt_word">is from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, not "belonging to," but "proceeding from," <a href="../../par/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22, 52</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the Jews.</span> The Jews have been the school where the highest lessons have been taught, the richest experiences felt, the noblest lives lived, the types and shadows of good things to come most conspicuous. We cannot avoid reading between the lines the sublime enthusiasm which Paul gathered from this class of teaching ("To whom pertaineth the adoption,...and covenant,...whose are the fathers, and to whom were committed the oracles of God,...  and from whom as concerning the flesh Christ came"). The utterance is profoundly significant, as it is a powerful repudiation of the theory which makes the author of this Fourth Gospel a Gentile of the second century, with a Gnostic antipathy to Judaism and Jews. The contradiction to this theory indubitably involved in this verse has led to the wildest conjectures - even the suggestion of a Jewish gloss on some ancient manuscripts of the Gospel has been one desperate device to save the theory. <span class="accented">Taut pis pour les fairs.</span>

But "spirit" here does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to the spirit of man - that part of man's constitution through which he most especially bears the image of God, and with which the Divine Spirit deals, and in which he dwells (<a href="../../par/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>). The worship in spirit is worship contrasted with all mere carnal concomitants, all mere shadows of the good things to come, all mere ritual, all specialties of place, or time, or sacrament, or order. It need not be in despite of a genuine reverence for days, or seasons, or postures, or washings, but in absolute independence of them, and they, without this, will be actually valueless. <span class="accented">And in truth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as dealing with reality, the adequate and veracious expression of genuine desires and veritable emotions; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">nam et</span> (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">For indeed also the Father seeketh such to be his worshippers.</span> Luthardt and Meyer differ as to the emphasis.

He would render, "For the Father also on his part seeketh," etc. Luthardt says that the new thought is to be found in <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, and therefore upon this the emphasis is laid. Westcott, by many passages, such as <a href="../../par/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32</a>, etc., urges that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> "alleges a reason which is assumed to be conclusive from the nature of the case." The whole sentence is therefore covered by the expression, "For the Father also on his part seeketh those as worshippers of him who worship him in spirit and in truth." A slight contrast is felt between the regimen of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with accusative, here again introduced, following upon that with dative in the first clause. Moulton would render the first clause, "offer worship to the Father," and the second by "worship him." The Father is now seeking, by the ministry of his Son, by the gift of his Spirit, for those who approach him with deeply felt need and true affection, in spirit, not in ceremony, in truth, not in hypocritical or heartless profession. This is another indication of the high truth taught in the prologue (<a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>, see notes) that there are vast differences among men, even anterior to their reception of the perfect revelation of the Father's heart in Christ Jesus. "The life is the light of men." There are those who "do the truth" and are "of the truth," who "worship God in spirit and in truth." The whole gospel dispensation is a search for these.

The most comprehensive and far-reaching metaphor or method by which Jesus endeavoured to portray the fundamental essence of the Divine Being is "Spirit," not body, not <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but that deep inner verity presented in self-conscious ego; the <span class="accented">substantia</span> of which mind may be predicated, and all its states and faculties. The Father <span class="accented">is</span> Spirit, the Son is Spirit, and Spirit is the unity of the Father and the Son. St. John has recorded elsewhere that "God is Light," and "God is Love." These three Divine utterances are the sublimest ever formed to express the metaphysical, intellectual, and moral essence of the Deity. They are unfathomably deep, and quite inexhaustible in their suggestions, and yet they are not too profound for even a little child or a poor Samaritaness to grasp for practical purposes.

From Genesis to Malachi, in the Psalms, in the historical books, in Judges, Samuel, and Kings, the Spirit and the spirituality of God are presupposed; but the Lord has generalized these teachings, cited them from darkness and neglect, combined them in one eternal oracle of Divine truth. The Galilaean Peasant has thus uttered the profoundest truth of ethic and religion - one which no sage in East or West had ever surpassed, and towards which the highest minds in all the ages of Christendom have been slowly making approach. Forms, postures, ceremonial, sacraments, liturgies, holy days, and places are not condemned, but they all are inefficacious if this prime condition be not present, and they can all be dispensed with if it be. Only the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of man can really touch or commune with the Spirit of spirits, and the history of the new dispensation is the history of a progress from forms to realities, from the sensuous to the spiritual, from the outward to the inward, from the earthly to the heavenly.

The Prophet she discovered answered a desire for the "where" by revealing the "how" they are to worship. But there are many other lessons they need, and she gives expression to an idea of the Messiah, and of his coming, which startles us by its boldness. <span class="cmt_word">The woman saith unto him, I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, I know as a matter of current opinion and with intuitive certainty) <span class="cmt_word">that Messias cometh</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is called Christ</span>). [This parenthetical clause by the evangelist is the explanatory translation into Greek of the Aramaic word. This must be so, unless we could be certain, with Hug, Diodati, and Roberts, that Jesus and the woman were speaking Greek to each other.] The woman turns from a theme which she has partially understood. How should a woman have been able at a moment to discharge and dispense with the traditions of a life, and the prejudices hoary with age? We know that the Samaritans anticipated One who should be a "converter," or "restorer" (Gesenius, 'Anecdota Samaritana,' p. 65, translates the Samaritan word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> by <span class="accented">conversor</span> (so Ewald); Hengstenberg, Tholuck, Meyer, by <span class="accented">restitutor</span>), and cherished a hope of his appearance, upon the faith of the great promise (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>) that One would arise who would make known to them the Divine will. It is remarkable, but not unreasonable, that she should have adopted the Hebrew word in common use among all the Jewish people. In ver. 29 it is given in Greek without any reference to the original speech. Samaritans and Jews alike anticipated a <span class="accented">Christ</span> an Anointed One, a Plenipotentiary, a Guide. The more spiritual apprehension which follows becomes some explanation of the fact that our blessed Lord should have admitted to <span class="accented">her</span> what he afterwards, in Galilee, kept reticently in reserve. The Galilaeans would have come, on his slightest encouragement, and against his will have made him a king. This would have forced on him a position and dignity which, from their standpoint, would have wrecked his spiritual mission and frustrated his design. This woman, here and later on, made it obvious that her notion of the "Restitutor" or "Messiah" was One who, <span class="cmt_word">when he is come, will declare to us all things;</span> in ver. 29 One who can read the secrets of the heart, and knows her and others altogether; while from ver. 42 we learn that she and her friends were anticipating there and then "the Saviour of the world." Luthardt here points back to <a href="../../par/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a> as part of the origin of the Samaritan idea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-26.htm">John 4:26</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <i>he</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto her, I that am talking with thee am he.</span> Jesus does utter to the Samaritan woman the truth about  himself which he withholds from the sensuous Galilaeans and the carping scribes. Throughout she is susceptible, inquiring, anxious for her own sake to know. The idea she entertained about Messiah would put no obstacle in the way of our Lord's admission, whereas the opposite idea, the passionate longing for a political revolution, led him to silence others, and even among his disciples to reserve the sublime fact as their sacred secret (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-20.htm">Matthew 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-9.htm">Matthew 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-30.htm">Mark 8:30</a>). The truth communicated to this woman was of supreme importance and of universal interest. Our Lord admitted his Messiahship, but of the deeper truths of his incarnation, of the nature of the birth from above, of the Divine life and love, of the means of redemption, and the principles of judgment, he says nothing. Nicodemus learns of both "earthly and heavenly things;" the Samaritaness receives some practical principles. Yet the two conversations are complementary to each other, and throw upon each other reciprocally floods of light. Moreover, there is the same parabolic speech in both; the same habit of mind. It is the same Teacher who uses "the wind" and "the water of the well" to illustrate great spiritual ideas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a></div><div class="verse">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-38.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Revelation and misunderstanding involved in the conduct of the disciples.</span> The next paragraph records the effects of this conversation upon the disciples, upon the woman herself, and upon her friends. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hereupon his disciples came;</span> they returned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those of them who had gone to Sychar, bringing their provisions and their <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> with them, <span class="cmt_word">and they marvelled</span> <span class="cmt_word">that he was talking with a woman</span>. Such a proceeding was contrary to the etiquette of a rabbi, who contended that "a man should not salute a woman in a public place, not even his own wife" (cf. Lightfoot, Edersheim, Wettstein). One of the daily thanksgivings was, "Blessed art thou, O Lord...  who hast not made me a woman" (Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span> (adds the eyewitness, one intimately acquainted with the innermost sentiments of the disciples) <span class="cmt_word">no one said, What seekest thou? Why talkest</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou with her?</span> They looked on with awe and reverence as well as wonder. They wondered whether he lacked aught which they could not supply. They marvelled (or, if we take the R.T., <span class="accented">they kept marvelling</span>) <span class="accented">at</span> the unwonted scene, that One so great as their Rabbi and Master should condescend to teach or converse with a woman at all; but they held their peace, with the conviction that what he did must be gracious, holy, and wise. One of the miracles of the Lord's ministry was to break down the wretched rabbinical prejudice against the spiritual capacities of woman, and the Oriental folly which supposed that she contaminated their sanctity. He lifted woman to her true position by the side of man. Women were his most faithful disciples. They ministered unto him of their substance. They shared his miraculous healing, feeding, and teaching. They anointed his feet, they wept over his agony, they followed him to the cross, they were early at the sepulchre. They greeted him as the risen Lord. They received the baptism of the Spirit. In Christ there is neither male nor female. Both are one in him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28</a></div><div class="verse">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The woman then</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in consequence of the arrival of the disciples) <span class="cmt_word">left her water pot</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>); left it to itself, forgot the object of her visit to the well, so engrossed was she with the new teaching, so amazed with his revelations; or perhaps, with womanly tact, left it that the disciples might, if they would, make use of it for their Master. Most commentators suggest that she left it, intending by the very act to come back again shortly for water. But this is scarcely the idea conveyed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>. Archdeacon Watkius truly says that this notice "is a mark of the presence of him who has related the incidents." <span class="cmt_word">And she went her way to the city</span> - probably beyond her home (see note, ver. 7), constituting herself at once the messenger and missionary of the new Teacher and Prophet, who had declared himself to be the Messiah - <span class="cmt_word">and saith to the men</span> whom she found in the marketplace or highway, <span class="cmt_word">Come, see a man who told me all things that</span> <span class="accented">ever <span class="cmt_word"></span>I did.</span> This exaggeration of the self-revelation was due to the deep conviction of her mind that the Prophet had read her whole life - its weakness and its follies, and it may have been its sins and crimes, not unknown, alas! to others as well. Chrysostom says, "She might have said, 'Come and see One that prophesieth;' but when the soul is aflame with holy fire it looks then to nothing earthly, neither to glory nor to shame, but belongs to one thing alone, the flame which occupieth it." There is a touch of <span class="accented">naivete</span>, of loquacity, of impetuous womanhood, about this, that thrills with life. She was not afraid, in the first gush of her new-found joy, to brave the  unflattering scorn of the men to whom such a confession was made; and then, in most natural and appropriate fashion, added, <span class="cmt_word">He is</span> <span class="cmt_word">not however the Christ, is he?</span> The question, by its form, suggests a negative answer; "but," Westcott says, "hope bursts through it (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>)." She knows that he <span class="accented">is</span> the Christ, but she wishes the townspeople to guess it - to come to a like conclusion with herself.

The men were already crossing the green fields that lay between Sychar and Jacob's well. This remarkable touch explains the conversation that immediately follows. We have the twofold scene depicted: on the one side, the disciples eager for their meal, and absorbed for the moment with thoughts of "terrene provender," unconscious of the vast yearnings of their Lord, and his passion for the regeneration and saving of men; and on the other side, the immediate effect, produced neither by signs nor wonders, but by his word only, on a few susceptible souls, who appeared to him living representatives and firstfruits of a redeemed humanity.

The first denotes, strictly speaking, the act of eating; and the second the material for food; but they are, in Greek literature, generally used almost interchangeably. There were Divine desires and sacred satisfactions which discriminated the Lord's consciousness from that of his disciples. Thoma refers to the mighty fasts of the great lawgiver and prophet as the literary antecedent of this significant event; but this superiority to food is true of every great soul. The men of the spirit are consumed with desires which dwarf the desires of the flesh, and they forget to eat their bread. Nor can we forget that the synoptic narrative places the forty dave' fast in this very epoch of Christ's life, chronologically speaking. (See note at end of this chapter.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-33.htm">John 4:33</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i>ought</i> to eat?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the disciples</span> (almost as obtuse as was Nicodemus, or the Samaritaness, or as the Jews generally were, in penetrating the hidden meaning of the Lord's words) unintentionally illustrate the parabolic method, the tissue of symbolic and metaphoric phrase which Jesus adopted throughout his ministry; they did not venture to question him further, but said one to another, <span class="cmt_word">Hath any one brought him aught to eat?</span> Did that Samaritan woman or any other? They could not, or did not, rise to the spiritual or unseen, nor for the moment did they get beyond the pressing needs of the flesh.

(The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a negative answer.)

"Lo, I come to do thy will, O God," was the motto and burden of his life. "Not my will, but thine," was the sacrificial cry which redeemed the world. To teach man to do the will of the Father is the motive which sustained him, and the prayer he put upon human lips was, "Thy will be done." Meyer here rightly says that <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is not equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. Some expression is given by it as to the <span class="accented">end</span> and purpose of the mysterious life of which we have these sacred illustrations. The doing of the will of God is a perpetual and sublime activity, a continuing, ceaseless purpose; while the completion of the work will be one consummating act, towards which all the daily doing of the will is a preparation, and of which, in some sense, every day we discern a prelibation and forthshadowing. In <a href="../../par/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a> he says, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having completed the work thou," etc. This passage  points on to that (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30, 6</a>:38; 7:18; 8:50; 9:4; 12:49, 50; 14:31, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a></div><div class="verse">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <i>then</i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say not ye</span> - has not your talk with one another been, as you have passed through the springing corn, <span class="cmt_word">There are yet four months, and</span> <span class="accented">then <span class="cmt_word"></span>cometh the harvest?</span> This cannot be a proverbial expression for the time which elapses between sowing and harvest, as some (Lucke and Tholuck) have supposed, because, firstly, there is no mention of sowing at all; and secondly, because <span class="accented">six</span> months was the customary period between seed time and ingathering; and also because the "say not ye?" would then be inappropriate. I cannot doubt that it was a chronological hint that the time at which Jesus spake was four months from either the barley or wheat harvest. These harvests generally occurred between the middle of March and the middle of April. The time must, therefore, have been either the middle of November or of December. Tristram (Westcott) says the (wheat?) harvest began about the middle of April and lasted till the end of May. This would bring the time forward another month. This makes our Lord to have spent some eight months since the Passover, either in Jerusalem or in the Judaean land, on his earliest mission, which as yet had brought no obvious results. Men had come to his baptism, but had not appreciated or accepted his claims. The faith already awakened had been of the evanescent character, based on "signs," outward not inward, a "milk faith," to which he did not entrust himself (ch, 2:240. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; they are whitening</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">harvest</span>. Our Lord now uses another metaphor - he bids the disciples glance across these rich cornfields, to observe the obvious effect already produced by the sowing of good seed in Samaritan soil. The people are flocking towards him. The harvest of souls is ripening, and it is great. You must wait four months before this springing corn will need the sickle. But I say unto you, The time is come. The kingdom is come. The reaper must prepare for instant service. Again, we have a note of personal identity between the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel and the Author of the parables of the sower and the harvest. The very rapidity with which he passes from the symbolism of <span class="accented">water</span> to the symbolism <span class="accented">of food</span>, and then to that of <span class="accented">seed time and harvest</span>, reminds us of One who "without a parable spake not." The words so far have universal application in every age. The harvest has always been ripening. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used in this place only for the aspect of ripening corn. It has elsewhere the meaning of glittering, translucent whiteness, and perhaps it is used here for "dead ripe." The golden grain in late summer becomes white, and this intensifies the force of the image. It seems to say, "These fields will be sacrificed, these fruits will be wasted, these souls will be lost, unless they are reaped and brought into the heavenly garner." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-36.htm">John 4:36</a></div><div class="verse">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - Then partially dropping, or rather explaining, his metaphorical language, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Already he that reapeth receiveth wages;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> receiveth from the great Owner of all souls the reward of fellowship with his purpose, and the recompense of entering into the supreme joy of the Lord of the harvest. The disciples might at once enter upon their harvesting. The work was itself "payment," but it has a distinct aim beyond mere <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> - be who reaps in this harvest of souls <span class="cmt_word">is gathering in fruit unto eternal life.</span> The water that Jesus gives, the refreshment of soul be is able to supply, becomes a well, a fountain, a river, an ocean of life, an eternity of blessedness; and now this fruit of souls, this harvest of saved men, is a Divine, eternal treasure, which the reaper houses in the garner of God. The final clause is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which certainly suggests here the "contemplated result" rather than the end of this ingathering. The "end" would be greater and nobler than what is here mentioned; the result is <span class="cmt_word">that even the sower and also the reaper may rejoice together.</span> Westcott here says that Christ does not speak of himself as "the Sower," but as "the Lord of the harvest." If it be so, the sowers of whom be thinks are all the preparatory processes, all the prophetic men, all the testifiers to the Light whose testimony was crowned in John, all the way by which Judaea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth have been prepared for the kingdom of the Spirit; and they will all rejoice together with yourselves who now begin your harvest joy. If so, the vista opens first into the long future of Christian enterprise, to be consummated at last in the heavenly world, where parted hands may meet again, and these who have never met before shall "clasp inseparable hands in joy and bliss in overmeasure forever!" All this may be proleptically contained in the words, but the special force of them would be severed from the circumstances which manifestly gave birth to them. These seem to me to be, primarily, Christ's own ministry of sowing on that very day.  The reaping of the harvest may begin at once, and so the Sower (the Son of God) and reapers who gather fruit unto life eternal may and will rejoice together. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-37.htm">John 4:37</a></div><div class="verse">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For herein</span> - in this harvest field, already whitening before your eyes - <span class="cmt_word">is the word veritably realized</span> - it finds an ideal illustration of its meaning - <span class="cmt_word">One is the sower, and another is the reaper.</span> It belongs to all common experience in such things; the first stone is laid by one, the topstone by another.

Children inherit the toil of their fathers. We all stand where the shoulders of the mighty dead have lifted us. Still, though one be the sower and another is the reaper in this Samaritan field, yet, since "already" the reaper is busy with the sickle, the sower and reapers may rejoice together. The law will be established on a grander scale by and by, when the great Sower, who is the Lord of the harvest, shall send forth all his reapers to their great enterprise, and he and they will rejoice together.

This <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is far more than the mere sowing of seed or diffusion of truth, and they who have during many centuries contributed of their life to the creation of the state of mind which makes these people susceptible to the truth, have prepared the way of the disciples. In a fit place, and in the fulness of the times, he came. The disciples of Jesus, moreover, have always had a greater or less degree of pioneer work to do. The efforts of the missionary Church may be represented at all times as toiling as well as sowing. Each generation of labourers in the great field of love to man enters upon work and toil which its precursors have originated. The Tubingen critics here, true to their theory of the origin of the Fourth Gospel in the second century, suppose that, by the "others," Jesus is supposed to <span class="accented">mean</span> Philip the evangelist, and, by the "reapers," Peter and John, who entered into his labours, in <a href="../../par/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15</a>. Hilgenfeld thinks by the "others" was meant Paul, and by the "reapers" the twelve apostles, who sought to enter upon his work and appropriate its fruit. Thoma has followed vigorously along the same lines, and supposes that the Pauline thought <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-8</a>, and the story of the conversion of the Samaritans and of the heathen world to the Church, are here forthshadowed by the fourth evangelist.

The first word is used for "utterance" pure and simple (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>), and for the inarticulate voices of lower creatures as well, while <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> never have the latter meaning; but still <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> is used in classical Greek for "discourse," and in <a href="../../par/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43</a> is used by Christ of his own "utterance." Meyer says the term is purposely chosen from the standpoint of the <span class="accented">speaker</span>, while in ver. 39 <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the same <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> by St. John as narrator.

There is no improbability that it should have expressed the thought of Samaritans, for they entertained wider and less nationalized views than did the Jews. Baur's notion, that the author wished to contrast heathen or Gentile susceptibility with Jewish narrowness and reserve, is out of keeping with the facts. A genuine heathen would have been as easy to <span class="accented">invent</span> as a susceptible Samaritan. "The Saviour of the world" is one of the noblest and most accurate terms in all the Bible to denote the work of Christ. It is the outcome of a discourse and of teaching which led men to the idea of spiritual and sincere worship of the Father, which searched for moral conditions rather than orthodox ritual, which demanded purity of life more than outward observance, and treated doing the will and work of the Father as more indispensable than necessary food. We need not be surprised (<a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.) to find the outcome of this sojourn of the Divine Lord among the misunderstood and hated Samaritans. The effort of the Tubingen school to find in this narrative an idealization of the synoptic tradition of Christ's special beneficence towards the Samaritans is very unfortunate, because, in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>, the "twelve" were forbidden to enter into cities of the Samaritans, and advised to occupy all their energies in evangelizing the cities of Israel. The record of <a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>. affords very slender basis for a corresponding enlargement. The narrative before us shows that, in answer to the receptivity of the Samaritans, the Lord made the richest and fullest and most explicit and immediate revelation of himself. The extension of the kingdom of grace to Samaritans, and their incorporation into the body of Christ, was arrested by the need of the visit of the apostles, by the magic and hypocrisy of Simon; of which there is not here the slightest trace.

They are silent with reference to these earliest witnesses to his method and varied specimens of his work. Just as in the Revelation of St. John we have a proem, and a series of visions which rehearse the entire development of the kingdom and glory of the Lamb of God until the day of his triumph, his wrath, and his great glory; so in these earlier chapters of the Fourth Gospel we have an anticipation of the entire ministry of Messiah. Specimens and illustrations are given of his creative might, of his purifying energy, of his forecast of the cross, of his demand for inward and radical renewal of his promise and gift of life. We can read in these events his principles of judgment and his  revelation of the Father, his mission to mankind as a whole, and his victory and drawing of souls to himself. We see, moreover, his relation to the theocracy and to the outlying world, to the learned rabbi and to the woman that was a sinner.. We see the Lord in his glory and in his humiliation. A very brief hint is given in the following verses of the character of his Galilaean ministry, Wherein mighty works and words alternate, and the first storm of direct opposition to him begins to make its appearance, upon which, while much light is cast by the narrative of ch. 5, we have no indistinct trace in the synoptic narrative. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43-45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now after the two days</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the two days of our Lord's sojourn in Sychar (ver. 40) - <span class="cmt_word">he went</span> <span class="cmt_word">forth</span>  <span class="cmt_word">thence</span> <span class="cmt_word">into Galilee.</span> Here the author takes up the narrative of ver. 3. The delay in Samaria was parenthetical to the chief end of his journey, which was to leave Judaea and commence his ministry in Galilee. He now enters it a second time from Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country, When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans willingly received him, having seen all things whatsoever he did in Jerusalem, at the feast: for they themselves also went to the feast.</span> These words bristle with difficulties, and hardly two commentators entirely agree in their interpretation of them. Christ's visit to Galilee is here accounted for by the principle embodied in the proverb, or <span class="accented">a part at least</span> of the proverb, which he used (according to the synoptic narrative) with reference to his visit to and reception in Nazareth, about this some period in his career. Apart from that reference, the most simple explanation of the quotation would be that our Lord regarded Jerusalem and Judge, as in one sense, and a very deep one, "his country," not simply his birthplace, and which he felt at twelve years of age was to contain his Father's house and kingdom and work; and of which he afterwards said, "O Jerusalem, that killest the prophets,... how oft would I...  but ye would not!" The Fourth Gospel records our Lord's various Judaean ministries with such striking incidents and impressive discourse, that his claim upon the loyalty of the metropolis was repeatedly urged and as repeatedly rejected. True that in vers. 1-3 we are told that our Lord left Judaea because the Pharisees, the influential religious party, were in a hostile sense comparing his ministry with that of the Baptist. This may only be another way in which the comparative unfruitfulness of his early ministry in Judaea is stated. "The prophet hath no honour in his own country." If this was the meaning of Christ's recurrence to the proverb, then we can understand the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 45, as well as the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> of ver. 44, The Galilaeans who had been up to Jerusalem, and been favourably impressed - perhaps more so than any Judaeans, having formed the bulk of those who received baptism at his hands - received him graciously on his entrance into Galilee. The whole passage thus would hang together; a subsequent and similar and more acute experience where he was best known by face, in Nazareth, drew from him an expanded form of the proverb, in sad and melancholy iteration, "A prophet is not without honour save in his own country, <span class="accented">and amongst his kindred, and in his own house"</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a>). [In Luke's enlarged account of the visit to Nazareth (Luke 4:16-30), possibly an event which is perfectly distinct from the visit to his "own country" cited by Matthew and Mark, the proverb appears in its shorter form.] This interpretation is that preferred by Origen, Maldonatus, Wieseler, Baur, etc., formerly by Ebrard and Lucke, and now by Westcott, Moulton, and Plummer. In my opinion it is the most satisfactory and least encumbered interpretation. It does not seem satisfactory to Meyer and others, who urge that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> can only mean what it obviously does in the synoptic narrative, viz. Galilee as represented by Nazareth. Meyer also interprets the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> as introducing a reason, not only for our Lord's present return to Galilee, but for his <span class="accented">earlier departure from Galilee to Judaea</span>; and Meyer supposes that he must have uttered the words <span class="accented">then.</span> On this supposition, the Galilaeans in the first instance must have failed to appreciate his prophetic claims. Christ had gone to Jerusalem and Judaea, and there acquired the fame of a prophet, and subsequently these Galilaeans were ready to recognize it second hand, on the occasion of his return. Godet adds to this the joyful emotion that was felt when the plan of Jesus had been successful as far as the Galilaeans were concerned. Moreover, he gives a pluperfect sense to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "he had testified." Against this we observe that our Lord must have soon found that, in a narrower and closer sense, his  nearest friends and neighbours had learned nothing by their journey to the feast; and that the author of the Fourth Gospel must have been ignorant of the kind of reception so soon accorded to our Lord at Nazareth. Bruckner and Luthardt suppose by the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> that Jesus either sought the struggle with his unbelieving compatriots or the solitude induced by the absence of sympathy. There is not the faintest trace of this in the narrative. Then, again, Cyril, Calvin, Bengel, Olshausen, Hengstenberg, suppose that by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is meant his own <span class="accented">city</span>, Nazareth, which is here contrasted with Galilee in general, including Capernaum, which became the missionary centre of his early ministry. These commentators suppose that, when we are told "he went to Galilee," it means (as we see from ver. 46) he went to Cana, "for he testified," etc.; and therefore that in this forty-fourth verse comes the tragic scene described in <a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>. Lange has supplemented this theory by another that removes part of the difficulty, viz. that by <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1fde;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> was meant <span class="accented">Lower</span> Galilee, including Nazareth, and by the Galilee of ver. 44 was meant <span class="accented">Upper</span> Galilee and the neighbourhood of the lake, including Capernaum, to which we find that, after his cruel treatment at Nazareth, he retired. So Geikie. Now, there are difficulties in either of these views, which give great awkwardness to the expression, "So he came to Cana again," in ver. 46. Tholuck, De Wette, Lucke, in various ways, urge that the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> of ver. 44 may mean <span class="accented">namely, that is to say</span>, etc., pointing onwards to the kindly reception which the Galilaeans gave him being due to the <span class="accented">signs</span> which they beheld, and not to the words of life which he had spoken. Every view seems to us far-fetched and inconsistent, with the exception of the first interpretation. The only objection that is at all urgent, arises from the fact that, in the synoptic narrative, Nazareth is spoken of as his country. But if this were so, we do but see in the reception accorded to him in Nazareth a further illustration of the very same spirit which was shown to him in the metropolis. In both places "he came to his own, and his own received him not." There is nothing improbable, if so, that in both places Jesus should have appealed to the homely proverb. On the second occasion he added to it, "his kindred and his home," as well as "his country."

In Cana of Galilee, not Judaea, he had manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him. He came, then, to Galilee, to Cana, and for a while tarried there, long enough for the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> to have heard of his healing power and prophetic gifts. There have been numerous attempts to identify this narrative of the nobleman's son with the healing of the centurion's servant as recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/7-2.htm">Luke 7:2</a>. Recently Weiss and Thoma have laid emphasis upon this identification. Strauss, Baur, and all the opponents of John's Gospel, are eager to press this subjective handling of the synoptic tradition. But, as Edersheim has observed, they are here in hopeless contradiction with their own theory; for we find that the Hebrew Gospel here confers the loftiest encomium upon a Gentile, and the Hellenic Fourth Gospel makes the hero of this scene to be a Jew. True, in both cases a man of higher rank than that of fishermen and taxgatherers approaches our Lord with a request on behalf of another. But it should be observed that in the one case we have a Roman centurion, a heathen man, coming with great faith, one who, though "not in Israel," recognizes the imperial claims of Jesus; in the present narrative we have an Herodian officer, some person of Jewish blood attendant on the tetrarch's court, who displays a weak faith, reproved though rewarded by the Master. The one asks for a dying slave afflicted with paralysis; the other for a dying son suffering from deadly fever. Jesus meets the centurion as he crones down from the mountain, after the delivery of the great sermon; the Lord, when he receives the request of the nobleman, was a resident in. Cana. Both cures are said to take place at Capernaum by the utterance of a word, but the centurion disclaims the right to a visit, and asks for a word only. The nobleman entreats that the Lord would travel from Cana to Capernaum to heal his son. Thus the two narratives, with certain resemblances, are still strongly contrasted. The <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is one in the service of a king. The title of a king was given to Herod in later times (<a href="../../par/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14</a>), and characterized other references to him. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">there was</span> a <span class="cmt_word">certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span>

The rumour of transactions of this kind wrought at Capernaum had been carried from Capernaum to  Nazareth (see <a href="../../par/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>.), and now the return of Jesus from Judaea was soon known in the cities along the shore of the lake. <span class="cmt_word">And he besought him</span> (<span class="accented">obs.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, indicating to some extent a kind of conscious right to seek the favour) <span class="cmt_word">that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, in John, often gives the purport of a prayer or a command) <span class="cmt_word">he would come down</span> (from the highlands of Galilee to the borders of the lake, sunk as it is in a deep depression) to Capernaum, <span class="cmt_word">and heal his son: for he was on the point of death</span> (Vulgate, <span class="accented">incipiebat mori</span>; compare and contrast <a href="../../par/john/12-33.htm">John 12:33</a>).

They are frequently brought together in Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>, etc.), and used in conjunction in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. John ordinarily uses (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) "works" to denote those objective tangible facts which were "signs" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Lord's higher nature and claims. Here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, a word meaning "portents," remarkable, inexplicable events out of the common order, accompanies "signs," to complete the notion. The craving for "signs and wonders" did absorb the higher life of Judaism. "The Jews require a sign" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>), and minds that are yet in the Jewish stage of partial discipline, for spiritual revelation, still do the same. There is still in many of us the weak faith which needs the stimulating diet of the "sign" before there is any full recognition of the Divine fulness of blessing. Christ does not condemn, though he mourns over, this spiritual babyhood; and while he says (<a href="../../par/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-24.htm">John 15:24</a>) that belief for the works' sake may lead up to true faith, yet the language addressed to Thomas, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed," reveals his deepest thought of their comparative worth. The demand for "signs and wonders" in Galilee contrasts with the ready reception which the Samaritans had given to his <span class="accented">word.</span> Many of the difficulties of these narratives arise from the obvious fact that they are so closely compressed. Weiss has a hard task to make what he calls this "harsh answer" tally with Matthew's account of the reception of the centurion, and of the "great faith" which in his case preceded the miracle. A single sentence in the urgent request of the nobleman, implying that at Capernaum they needed the same kind of proof that had been given at Jerusalem of the Lord's prophetic claims, would account for all the emphasis laid upon the inperfect faith of the Galilaeans. He who "knew what was in man" knew in what way to rouse in this suppliant an adequate recognition of the Divine in himself.

Note that Jesus used the most dignified title, "son" (<span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); the father employs the tender diminutive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); while the servants use the domestic term (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>).

(This peculiar phrase is suitable on the lips of a man of rank; literally, "he did bravely, exceedingly well;" and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is occasionally used in contradistinction with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in a similar sense. Epictetus, 'Diss.,' 3:10-13.) <span class="cmt_word">They say to him, therefore, Yesterday during the seventh hour the fever left him.</span> The advocates of John's adoption of the Roman computation of time suppose that this was <span class="accented">seven p.m.</span>, and, therefore, that a night had intervened on the return journey (so Westcott, Edersheim, and Moulton). This is not necessary, because, even on the Jewish computation, from sunrise to sunset, though the seventh hour must then mean between noon and one p.m., it could not have happened that much before midnight he should have broken into the streets of Capernaum. At that hour the noon <span class="accented">might</span> be spoken of as "yesterday." This, however, is not imperative; for, if the distance between Capernaum and Cana was from twenty to twenty-five miles, and if the nobleman had travelled to Cana on the day that he presented his request, it is clear that a night's halt might easily have been required. Baur and Hilgenfeld make the note of time an attempt on the part of the writer to exaggerate the marvel, as if the distance through which the will of Christ asserted itself could augment the wonder, or that the real supernatural could be measured by milestones. And Thoma thinks so poorly of the originality of the Johannist, that he imagines him to have worked into his narrative some of the small details of the Cornelius and Peter interviews in <a href="../../par/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-53.htm">John 4:53</a></div><div class="verse">So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The father then knew</span> (came to know, by putting the facts together) <span class="cmt_word">that his</span> <span class="cmt_word">son began to amend in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Try son liveth.</span> The word was mighty, none other than that very voice of the Lord "which healeth all our diseases," and "redeemeth our lives from destruction."

This is the earliest mention of "household faith" (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15, 34</a>). In this case a whole picture rises before our eye. The mother, the sisters, the servants, the entire family, had shared in the anxiety, had sympathized in the journey to Cana, and now accepted the exalted claims of Jesus. Faith is graciously contagious. The nearness of the unseen world often reveals the features of the God-Man. The suggestion has frequently been hazarded that this <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> was Chuza, the house steward of Herod, whose wife, Joanna, ministered to Jesus (<a href="../../par/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a> and Luke 24:10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/4-54.htm">John 4:54</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> again the second miracle <i>that</i> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is again a second sign which Jesus did, when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span> The point is that each return from Judaea to Galilee had been charged with special emphasis by the occurrence of a "sign." We are told (<a href="../../par/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>) of slams wrought in Jerusalem, and, consequently, it could not be meant to be the second sign wrought by him. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> clause, <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the repetition of his entrance on work in Galilee. The first sign was the transformation of the water; the second, under similar conditions, was the healing a dying child by his word (so Godet, Lunge, and Westcott). This passage of St. John's Gospel which we have now reviewed is a distinct period of our Lord's life and ministry, concerning which the synoptists were silent; and it is marvellously complete in itself. It is an epitome of the whole life of the blessed Lord, and presents an outline and specimen of his method and his work. The disciple unnamed seems always at the side of the Lord. A mighty spell had fallen on him; and he was beginning already to discern in him the characteristics which ultimately directed him to compose the prologue. The penetration of the hidden secrets of all hearts - first his own, then those of Cephas and Nathanael, and the motives of Mary, and the spirit of Nicodemus, the intentions of the Pharisees, the secret life of the Samaritaness, and the inchoate and imperfect faith of the nobleman. Jesus is presented to us in marvellously different, yet mutually complementary, relations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Gathering susceptible spirits to himself, and judging men by the reception they were giving or not giving to his word; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nathanael, Nicodemus, the Jews, the  Samaritans, the Galilaeans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Accepting or revealing the mightiest and most enduring names - "The Son of God," "the Lamb of God," the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, "the King of Israel," the Opener of the kingdom of heaven, the Creator of all things, the Head of the theocracy, the Rebuilder of the temple of his body, the Teacher of the teacher of Israel, the "Son of man," the Saviour, the Giver of eternal life, the Light, the Bridegroom of the true bride, the Object of the eternal Father's love, the Revealer of the Father in his most essential features and most perfect will, the "Prophet that should come into the world," the "Saviour of the world," the "Christ of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> We see him, in the majesty of his omnipotence, hiding himself, as the Almighty always does, behind and in his works; we see him hallowing and heightening the joys of nuptial love, and again purifying the house of God from all contaminating adjuncts; we see him in his exalted mood consumed by holy zeal, and also weary and thirsty by the well, asking for water from an alien, and making to her the most astonishing revelations, hushing the pride, as they have secured the reverence, of all after ages by their spirituality and refinement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> We have specimens of every kind of reception and non-reception accorded to his teaching. Some at once perceive his extraordinary claims, and pour forth their homage; others are silent, and pass out of sight forever. Some are cold and reserved, critical and puzzled; others glow and gush with instantaneous conviction. We see in these chapters the shadow of the cross, and gleams also of the crown of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> We have, moreover, remarkable forthshadowing of the immense human personality which is sustained, not only by what follows in this Gospel, but by what was well known and widely circulated when this Gospel was written, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the impression which he spontaneously gave of reserves of power and truth. A necessity seems imposed upon him of speaking in parabolic, enigmatic language. He continually rises from the commonest incident and material to the Divinest truth; utilizing for his purpose the fig tree, the wine cup, the temple courts and sanctuary, the roaring wind, the flowing water, the rising corn, and the coming harvest. One remarkable aspect of this preliminary ministry is the light it throws upon the profoundly difficult passage in the synoptics, descriptive of the temptation of Jesus - a subject on which this evangelist says nothing. Later on, indeed, he tells us that Jesus said, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me;" and, "Now is the crisis of this world: now is the prince of this world cast out. And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men to me" (<a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>). In these chapters the evangelist records certain events which correspond in a remarkable way with the threefold temptation of the devil, which we know to have preceded the public ministry in Galilee. Thus, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> over against the devil's temptation to make stones into bread for his own sustenance, and as proof of his sonship to himself, we find that Mary his mother said to him, at the marriage feast, "They have no wine." His reply was, "Not in the way which you propose will I make myself known to the world." "Mine hour [for that] is not yet come." He did, however, in a manner baffling to all but his disciples, turn water into wine for the behoof of poverty and the hallowing of earthly joy, and the manifestation, not so much of the glory of his power as of the fulness and sweetness of his love. Compare with this his asking for <span class="accented">water</span> from the well for his own refreshment as a weary, thirsting man, and also the spirit of his reply to his disciples, "I have meat to eat which ye know not off;" "My meat is to do the will of him who sent me." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Over against the devil's temptation to descend in splendid supernatural effect from the pinnacle of the temple upon the astonished multitude, trusting in the mean while to the hands of angels to hold him up, we have John's account of his sudden appearance in the temple, when, consumed by holy zeal for its purity, instead of loud acclaim, he encountered the first muttering of the storm which culminated on Calvary, and made it evident that he only looked to victory over their prejudices by eventually building up that temple of his body which they, by their obtuseness, were beginning to destroy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Over against the temptation to win the powers of the world and the glory of them by a sinful compromise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by admitting the  legitimacy of the power of the devil in human polity, John tells us that Jesus, by uncompromising fidelity to his great mission as spiritual Healer, waved off the half-homage of the ruler of the Jews and master of the schools, and pointedly declared his need of personal, individual regeneration. Then we read that he quietly began his humble career of persuasion, that he grappled with and discarded the presumptuous claim of nationality, and announced the nature of spiritual worship. Not by the pomp of national homage won by truckling to the power of evil, but by the conversion of the simple hearts of Samaritans through their personal conviction that he was indeed the <span class="accented">Saviour</span> (not the Caesar) of the world, he would win the world. Such obvious comparisons are not fortuitous. These events set forth, on a magnificent scale of converse and action, the deep lessons of the temptation, and show, as. the synoptists tell us, that he was filled with the Holy Ghost (see Introduction). Yet, notwithstanding all this, it were a great mistake to suppose that he had exhausted his resources or his teaching; he has simply uttered the alphabet of the whole gospel which he is about to disclose. The teaching of the valedictory discourse is prodigiously in advance of this introduction to his ministry. The truths absolutely revealed are the need of a complete purification of man and temple, the imperative necessity of heavenly birth, of spiritual worship, of implicit faith in the Father's love, and of patient waiting for God. We have two incidents of the Lord's ministry in Galilee, but also impressive hints of the adaptation of his gospel to that world of strangers and outcasts that he has come to seek and save. Our great difficulty is in the silence which the Fourth Gospel preserves concerning the continuous ministry of our Lord in Galilee after this preparation for it. In <a href="../../par/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a> we learn that the Jews' Passover was at hand, and we find ourselves in the midst of a group of facts in which some chronological hints may be gained. The multiplication of the loaves, the walking upon the sea, are events which are recorded by the synoptists, and which appear there to have followed the execution of John the Baptist, and the conclusion of the trial mission of the twelve disciples. We must, therefore, conclude that, between the Passover of <a href="../../par/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a> and <a href="../../par/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, one year must have, at least, elapsed. (It is true that Browne, in his 'Ordo Saeculorum,' has endeavoured to obliterate this reference to the Passover as a gloss, but without any authority from codices, or versions, or other diplomatic evidence.) This period, moreover, includes a vast amount of incident in the synoptic narrative; all that, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, which is recorded in Mark between <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> and John 6:56. Now, it is obvious that, after a period of general response to his claims, our Lord encountered (according to the synoptists) an organized opposition from the Pharisees (see <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/mark/2.htm">Mark 2, 3</a>, and parallels, and especially from <a href="../../par/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a> to John 3:6), in particular a bitter and deadly persecution on the ground of his heterodoxy of word and conduct with reference to the rabbinic interpretation of the sabbatic law. There are also other indications of a rising storm of indignation, even in Galilee, to modify the popular enthusiasm. Concerning this John says nothing, but he does record the origin of the storm in the metropolis in his account of a journey to Jerusalem taken in the course of this period. It was his obvious purpose to detail the history of the conflict with the hierarchical party at Jerusalem. The metropolis was the great focus of the antagonism to Christ, and John describes those scenes which appeared in Jerusalem to have stimulated the assault, and thereby, elicited the self-revelation of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/john/5.htm"><title>John 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/john/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/john/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/john/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../john/4.htm" title="John 4">&#9668;</a> John 5 <a href="../john/6.htm" title="John 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-47.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">Christ proved, by signs and wonders and testimonies, to be Source of life.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">A sign on a paralyzed body and an unsusceptible soul.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The journey to Jerusalem is said to have taken place at the time of "a feast," or "the feast of the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>).

"The feast" referred to in <a href="../../par/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a> undoubtedly means the first Passover. "A feast" would leave the question open, though by no means excluding positively the second Passover, as the anarthrousness of the word might be chosen with a view to call special attention to it. However, the indefinite <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> has been identified by commentators with every feast in the calendar, so there can be no final settlement of the problem. If the feast be the Passover, then our Lord's ministry lasted a little more than three years. If not, it must be one or other of the feasts that elapsed between the Passovers of ch. 2 and ch. 6 Edersheim, with many others, refuses to accept any chronological hint in <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore throws the journey from Jerusalem to Galilee a few weeks after the first Passover, in the early summer, and supposes that Jesus returned to the unnamed feast in the autumn. Several critics say of <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, one part of the sentence must be parabolical and the other literal, and that the disciples might be anticipating a spiritual harvest after four months, and Jesus drew from the physically ripening corn fields his comparison. This seems to me entirely contrary to our Lord's ordinary method; and that the disciples were in too carnal a mood to be credited with an anticipation of spiritual results in Samaria at all. Those who think that <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> does give a hint of four months preceding harvest, place the journey between the middle of December and the middle of January. To my mind there is consequently no difficulty in imagining that when those four months should have been spent, and before the regular calling and appointment of the twelve apostles, our Lord should have gone up to the feast - one of the feasts which did summon the adult men to the metropolis. This is the view of Irenaeus, Luther, Cretins, Lampe, Neander, Hengstenberg, Conder, and many others. Wieseler, Hug, Meyer Lance, Godet, Weiss, Farrar, Watkins, think that the Feast of Purim, celebrated on the 15th of Adar (or March) (2 Macc. 15:36), in commemoration of the deliverance of the people from the evil intention of Haman (<a href="../../par/esther/9-21.htm">Esther 9:21</a>, etc.), was that national fast and feast which Jesus thus honoured. Purim was not one of the divinely appointed festivals, but it is also stated that the Lord undoubtedly attended one of the national and recently appointed festivals, that of Dedication (<a href="../../par/john/10-22.htm">John 10:22</a>). The more serious objection is that it could, if desired, have been celebrated quite as well in Galilee as in Jerusalem, and that the method of celebration seemed contrary to the whole spirit of the Master, and the whole tone of the discourse which followed. It is said that part of the ritual of the feast was the free and frequent gifts made spontaneously by one to another. Westcott prefers the autumn Feast of Trumpets as more suitable on several grounds than the Passover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because of the absence of the article, - this, however, is very problematical (see Tischendorf, 8th edit.); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because when at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>) the incident described in ch. 5 is still in lively recollection; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the great events of the Feast of Trumpets, the commemoration of the Creation and the Law giving, correspond with the theme of the Lord's great discourse. The fact that this particular miracle on the sabbath should be referred to a few mouths later in Jerusalem, on Christ's third appearance there, is not improbable, if we bear in mind that Judaean emissaries in Galilee had been bitterly  assailing Jesus, on the ground of his persistent determination to heal sickness and hopeless maladies on the sabbath day. This Jerusalem "sign," and the claim he made on the ground of it, had roused the cry, and was still the matter of contention. The claims of the Purim feast turn principally on the fact that, since it occurred, about a month before the Passover, on the 14th or 15th of Adar, this visit might have taken place in the course of the four months referred to in <a href="../../par/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore between the sojourn in Samaria and the Passover of <a href="../../par/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, which Jesus diet not attend. Dr. Moulton (assuming the anarthrous form of the <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) thinks that the feast is left undetermined because there was nothing in it typical of our Lord's work, and fulfilled in his Person. Such a position renders the visit itself strange and apparently unealled for. These long gaps, silences, during which there is no record of event or discourse, constitute a leading feature of the gospel history, and indeed of most of the history of both Old and New Testaments. To my mind there is advantage rather than otherwise in supposing more time than a few months to have been consumed in the Galilaean ministry described in <a href="../../par/mark/2.htm">Mark 2</a> and 3 Tregelles and the Revisers, with Westcott and Hort, have relegated the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> of <a href="../../par/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a> to the margin, but; Tischendorf (8th edit.) and Canon Cooke, etc., retain the remarkable expression, on the overwhelming evidence of a host of authorities. If it stand, which we believe it must, then during the Galilaean ministry, and in the interval which preceded the Passover mentioned in ch. 6:4, there is a reference to the proximity of a previous Passover and a previous harvest; the Galilaean opposition to Christ on this question of ritual being at its very height. If so, the feast must have been the Passover. The question cannot be finally settled, and commentators are in hopeless conflict with one another. It must be admitted that the majority of modern critics assume the Feast of Purim to be that intended, and thereby reduce the length of our Lord's ministry from Cana to Calvary to two short years. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> This was before the formal call of the twelve apostles, and there is no proof that he was accompanied by his disciples. Many of the commentators (and see Weiss, 'Life of Christ,' vol. 2:321) urge that not even John himself was present on the occasion, from the absence of lifelike touches and particularity of incident. There is, however, much detail in the first fifteen verses. The great discourse that follows is not broken into dramatic dialogue, and does certainly present more of the biographer's subjective treatment than other portions of the narrative. It is more conceivable, however, that John did, on grounds mentioned by Caspari (see Introduction), accompany his Lord, and learned, by what he heard of these great words, and by subsequent converse with Jesus, the burden of the mighty revelation. Thoma sets to work in the most dogmatic way, and Weiss with a perfectly different spirit, to demonstrate the identity of the narrative which follows, with the famous story of the cure of the paralytic "borne of four" which occurs in the synoptic narrative. Thoma goes further, and imagines that the supposed healing of the paralytics by both Peter and Paul are also here idealized. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there is in Jerusalem.</span> A phrase denoting intimate acquaintance with the topography of the city, and the present tense suggests either a hint of a ruin yet existing after the fall of Jerusalem, or it may betray the fact that the evangelist wrote down at the very time some details of the incident which formed the occasion of the following discourse, and never, in his later editing of the document, omitted or altered the form of his sentence. <span class="cmt_word">At the sheep</span> (<span class="accented">market</span>) or (<span class="accented">gate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>a pool, surnamed in Hebrew Bethesda, having five</span> <span class="accented">porticoes</span> or <span class="cmt_word">porches</span><span class="accented">. The adjective</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span> requires some substantive to be introduced, and since there is no reference to any sheep market in the Old Testament, little justification can be found for the gloss contained in the Authorized Version. There was a "sheep gate" mentioned in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1, 32</a> and Nehemiah 12:39. There is no reason against this method of supplying the sense, except this, that there is no other instance of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, or "gate," being omitted after this fashion. The "sheep gate" stood next. in Nehemiah's recital, to the "fish gate," and it was built by the priests. The old "sheep gate" is now known by the name of St. Stephen's Gate, to the north of the Haram es-Sherif, or temple area from which the path leads down into the valley of the Kedron, and if "gate" be the proper term to add to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> and we have its site fixed by the modern St. Stephen's Gate, then we must look for the pool surnamed Bethesda in that vicinity. Eusebius and Jerome speak of a <span class="accented">piscina probatica</span> as visible in their day, but do not determine its site. Robinson ('Bib. Researches,' 1, p. 489) did not accept the identification of the sheep gate with St. Stephen's Gate, and places the former more to the south, and nearer to what is now called the Fountain of the Virgin. This fountain, on Robinson's visit, displayed some curious phenomena of periodical and intermittent ebullition, receiving a supply of water from another source. It was found by Robinson to be  connected by a tunnel with the fountain of Siloam, and the relations of these wells have been quite recently submitted to fresh examination ('Palestine Expl. Soc. Rep.,' Oct. 1883). Robinson identified this pool with "Solomon's Pool" of Josephus and "King's Pool" of Nehemiah, and thought it might be the original pool of Bethesda. Neander and Tholuck incline to agree with him. The observations of Robinson have been confirmed by Tobler, and at least show that what certainly happens now in some of these fountains may have been phenomena constantly expected at some other fountain bearing the name now before us, on the northeastern side of the Haram area. Within the (sheep gate) St. Stephen's Gate the traditional site of Bethesda is pointed out. The modern name is <span class="accented">Birket lsrael</span>, and this tank, from the accumulation of rubbish, does not now show its original extent; neither does it now hold water, but receives the drainage of neighbouring houses (Colonel Wilson in 'Plot. Palestine,' vol. 1, pp. 66, 106-109). A church, near that of St. Anne, was built by the Crusaders over a well, in this immediate vicinity - a spot which was supposed to be the site of the angelic disturbance. Colonel Wilson prefers this traditional site to that fixed upon by Robinson. So also Sir G. Grove, in Smith's 'Bible Dict.' <span class="accented">The five porches</span>, or porticoes, may have been a columnar structure of pentagonal form, which sheltered the sick and the impotent folk. At present no indubitable relic of this building has been discovered. Alford (7th edit.) quotes a letter which makes it probable that Siloam was Bethesda, and the remains of four columns in the east wall of that pool, with four others in the centre, show that a structure with five openings or porches might easily have been erected there. <span class="accented">Bethesda</span>, which is said to be the Hebrew (that is, Aramaic) surname of the pool, is very doubtful. Probably this is the correct form of the text, though there are many variants, such as <span class="accented">Bethzatha</span>, in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, 33, Tischendorf (8th edit.); <span class="accented">Bethsaida</span>, in some versions and Tertullian. It seems generally allowed that its significance (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) is "house of grace or mercy," and that it derived its reference from the dispensation there of God's providential gifts. The healing virtue of waters charged with iron and carbonic acid and other gas is too well known to need reference, and the remarkable cures derived from their use may account forevery part of the statement which was here written by John. Eusebius speaks of these waters as "reddened," so he thought, with the blood of sacrifices, but tar more probably by chatybeate earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In these</span> (porches) <span class="cmt_word">lay a multitude of sick folk, blind, lame,</span> <span class="cmt_word">withered,</span> [<span class="cmt_word">waiting for the moving of the water; for an angel went down season by season into the pool, and troubled the waters: he then that first stepped in after the troubling</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the water became whole of whatsoever disease he had].</span> The interesting gloss discussed below conveys the idea of magical cure, without moral significance, and attributes such cure to angelic ministry. This is the natural and popular explanation of the Bethesda healings, and would easily occur to a copyist who has not taken pains to use New Testament diction. Wunsche quotes from 'Chullin,' fol. 105, <span class="accented">b</span>, a testimony that "deadly qualities of water were attributed to demons, and healing ones to the angels." The crowds which gather in all countries round medicinal and intermittent springs are still unable to explain their curative quality by scientific analogies; and there is nothing more likely to have suggested itself to the mind of a copyist than the intervention of an angel. The absence from Scripture elsewhere of non-moral miracles is powerful internal reason for the lack of authenticity for the poetic gloss. The text. when deprived of this dubious gloss, loses all character that is inconsistent with the authenticity of the narrative. The close of ver. 3, "waiting for the moving of the waters," is far better attested than ver. 4, and, moreover, is  consistent with John's manner, and with well ascertained matters of fact; and the clause would give authentic ground for the gloss that fellows. Hoffmann and Hengstenberg defend the passage, and believe that the angel at "the waters" in the Apocalypse betrays the same hand. But there can be no fair comparison between an historical fact and a symbolical figure.

The length implies the inveteracy of the disease. Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, Westcott (in part), imply a marked correspondence between these thirty-eight years and the similar period of time during which Israel was compelled to wander in the wilderness. It is not said how long the man had lain in the five porches waiting listlessly for healing, but that the malady was of old standing, and to all human appearance incurable. Thoma finds allegorical meaning in "Bethesda" - a synonym of the metropolls, and keeps up a series of comparisons with <a href="../../par/acts/3.htm">Acts 3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-6.htm">John 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case</i>, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus saw him lying there, and perceived</span> (came to know by his searching glance and intuitive knowledge of the history of others) <span class="cmt_word">that he had during a long time already been</span> (<span class="accented">in that condition</span>, or <span class="accented">in sickness</span>,) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>said unto him</span> - spontaneously, in the royalty of his benefactions, not demanding from the man even the faith to be healed, and dealing with him almost as he did with the dead - Wilt thou be made whole? The leper came beseeching him, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." The leper was quite sure of his own intense desire for cleansing, and all he questioned was the <span class="accented">will</span>, not the <span class="accented">power</span>, of Jesus. The admission of the power was a tacit cry for healing. The questioning of Jesus on this occasion involved an offer of mercy. "<span class="accented">Dost thou veritably wish</span> for health and strength?" The question implies a doubt. The man may have got so accustomed to his life of indolence and mendicancy as to regard deliverance from his apparent wretchedness, with all consequent responsibilities of work and energy and self-dependence, as a doubtful blessing. He whined out, with professional drawl, his oft-told story, reflecting very much upon his lovelessness and quarrelsomeness, and ugly temper. There are many who are not anxious for salvation, with all the demands it makes upon the life, with its summons to self-sacrifice and the repression of self-indulgence. There are many religious impostors who prefer tearing open their spiritual wounds to the first passerby, and hugging their grievance, to being made into robust men upon whom the burden of responsibility will immediately fall. In this case the sign of his palsied nature was written upon his face, and was probably known to every passerby. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sick</span> (impotent) <span class="cmt_word">man answered him:</span> <span class="cmt_word">Sir,</span> <span class="cmt_word">I have no man, when the water has been troubled, to put me</span> <span class="cmt_word">into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me</span>. This implies that some special advantage accompanied the troubling of the water. The sudden escape of the medicinal gas may have soon subsided, and, with it, the special virtue of the well. The difficulty which the sick man found in reaching the point of disturbance may be accounted for in many ways. The steps which led into the water; the weakness of the sufferer, which made it an impossible task without help; the eagerness at many other impotent folk to take advantage of the supposed cure, jostling one another with selfish haste; or the absence of any personal friend to fight his battle for him, and cast him (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span>) with the required plunge into water. The last point may be explained on the supposition that he was a comparative stranger in Jerusalem, and had made no friends; or by another, which several other allusions justify, viz. that he was a man who, from some reason or other, could neither make nor retain friendship. The melancholy recital of his frequent disappointment is given with an air of mendicant resignation - a kind of morbid satisfaction with his lot. The phrase, "while I am coming, another," etc., implies that he could move, if slowly, without help. The moroseness of self-dependence characterizes some sufferers, who rather glory in isolation than lament it. Still, the words express the hopelessness of thousands who, for lack of human help, are jostled out of life, peace, and salvation.

He did not touch him or use any other means than his own life-giving word to confer the cure. He put forth, in royal might and spontaneous unsolicited exertion, the miraculous force.  The energy of the Lord's will mastered the palsied will of the sick man, and infused into him the lacking energy. Archdeacon Watkins supposes that the man did possess incipient and recipient faith, moved by the generous tenderness and sympathetic interest of the Stranger in his ease. The very striking fact mentioned in the synoptic cure of the paralytic, viz. that he was borne into the presence of Jesus by four friends, ought to have prevented Thoma's caricature of criticism, which makes this narrative a mere idealization of that. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-9.htm">John 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">immediately</span> <span class="cmt_word">the man became whole</span> (well, sound in health), <span class="cmt_word">and took up his bed, and walked.</span> This act of obedience was an act of faith, as in every other miracle upon paralyzed nerves and frames. The imagery of the sign explains the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of faith. The impotent man, the paralytic, and the man with withered hand, were severally called by Christ to do that which without Divine aid seemed and was impossible. The spiritual quickening of the mind was communicated to the ordinary physical volition, and the bare act was a method by which the palsied sufferer took hold of God's strength. Faith always lays hold thus of power to do the impossible. The words and the result are similar to those adopted on the cure of the paralytic. This is another instance of the identity of the Christ of John and of the synoptists. The various efforts of Strauss, Baur, and Weiss to identify this miracle with that wrought on the paralytic is, however, in defiance of every condition of time, place, character, and consequences. The energy of faith and love which led the Galilaean sufferer to secure the services of four stalwart friends, not only to carry him, but to make strenuous efforts to bring him into the presence of Jesus, contrasts powerfully with the loneliness and friendlessness of the impotent man; and the method adopted by the Lord to convey his grace, and the discussion that followed on that occasion touching the power of the Son of man to forgive sins, all suggest profoundly different circumstances. Nothing but the claim of the critic to be entirely superior to the document he is interpreting can account for so wild a conjecture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-10.htm">John 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9b-16.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The outbreak of hostility due to the breach of the sabbatic law.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it was the sabbath on that day</span>. The form of the expression implies that it was one of the festival sabbaths rather than the weekly sabbath. These days, however, received the same reverence, and were observed with nearly the same rites and restrictions, as the ordinary sabbaths. This statement is the keynote of the great discourse which fellows, and it is made to prepare the way for the subsequent incidents. <span class="accented">The Jews</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the authorities, either the rabbis or Sanhedrists who were present in the crowd which gathered round the pool of Bethesda, or filled the neighbouring courts, are to be distinguished from "the multitude," or from the people generally. The designation evidently means the leading folk, the social censors, the hierarchy, who very soon displayed in marked fashion their jealousy and hatred of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore said to the man who</span> <span class="cmt_word">had been healed, It is sabbath,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</span> Judging by the letter of the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a> and Exodus 35:3), and by the precedents of Scripture (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-35</a>), and by the special injunctions of the prophets (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>, etc.), the man was infringing a positive command. Rabbinism had indeed declared that, in cases affecting life and health, the law of the sabbath was legitimately held in abeyance; but this relaxation was so hedged about with restrictions that the poor man and the layman were unable to apply the rules. The rabbinic interpretations of the sabbatic law concerning burden bearing were so intricate and sophistical that the entire majesty of the law, and the merciful intent of the prohibition, were concealed and vitiated. Apart from these complications, the man was <span class="accented">prima facie</span> disobeying the letter of the law. 'Shabbath,' fol. 6, <span class="accented">a</span>, declares that if unwittingly a burden was carried on the sabbath, the transgressor was bound to bring a sin offering; if with knowledge, he must be stoned.

The Prophet-like Healer must know what was right, and upon his shoulders the responsibility must rest. There was a rabbinic saying, which the cured man may or may not have heard, that conferred a dispensing power upon a prophet; but the marl could not have known with any certainty that such was Christ's official character. It is, moreover, clear that he did not know at this moment either the face, the voice, or the  name. Meyer hears a ring of defiance in these words. The other hints we obtain touching the man's character do not sustain such an idea.

Saving men by questionable methods is not to be endured. "Who is the man?" "Men and women lying in moral helplessness, not helped by God's priests and rulers, are now standing and moving in the strength their new Teacher has given. They cannot deny it; but can they prevent it? The rabbinic precept which he has crossed shall be applied to stamp out his work and kill him" (Watkins).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> (see ver. 1).

The Lord's habit of visiting the temple, and the penetrating glance which he casts over all the frequenters of his Father's house might then fairly be deduced from the passage; but the motive of the man is quite conjectural. From the words of Jesus one might as reasonably suppose that the man was treading at the time on dangerous moral ground, making some kind of gain from his notoriety. The healing was, at least, imperfect until the man had learned its spiritual significance. Every gift of God is doubled in value when its source is recognized. God's signature on his own mercies gives them their true meaning. Christ found the healed man in the precincts of the temple, whether his motive was pure or mixed in going thither. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Beheld, thou art made whole</span> (hast become sound and healthy throughout thy physical system; cf. for the form of this description of his case, the query, ver. 6): <span class="cmt_word">no longer continue to sin.</span> The form of the sentence points to something special and persistent in this man's habits, rather than to the general corruption of human nature. Christ's penetrating glance discovered all the hidden misery and bleeding wound and putrefying sore of the man's soul. Apart from the obliteration of the consequences of his bad life, and without a clean and free condition of things, the future would have proved hopeless, and deliverance from the yoke of fear and concupiscence impossible; but now this new chance is given. He was made whole, born again physically. As Naaman's flesh became like that of a little child, so this man - once bent, crippled, distorted by his self-indulgence, and now made whole - is to "sin no longer." It would not be  reasonable to conclude from this that Christ's doctrine, like that of Job's friends, involved the indissoluble connection of sin with sickness, or made the amount of pain in any case the criterion of individual sin. Our Lord repudiates this position in <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a> and in <a href="../../par/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-5</a>; but special calamities have unquestionably followed wrong doing, and can, in many instances, be referred to obvious transgressions, to specific acts, or inveterate habits. The man's own conscience would respond to the charge. Jesus added: <span class="cmt_word">Lest a worse thing befall thee.</span> There is, then, something worse than thirty-eight years of apparently hopeless wretchedness! Jesus said, even as reported by the apostle of love, the most terrible things that ever fell from human lips. The "sin no longer" makes it seem as though man's will could accomplish much (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>, "Cease," etc.), and as though all the future of our life were, so far as human responsibility goes, dependent upon ourselves. We are to act as if it were. Let it be noticed that he who said, "Sin no more," said, "Rise up, take thy bed, and walk." Three things, which appeared utterly beyond the power of the impotent man, were, nevertheless, done by him through the grace of Christ, which he then and there appropriated.

He <span class="accented">may</span> have sought to win from his interlocutors some reverence for his Healer; but everything points the other way. He was a loveless being; he seems to have been nettled by the charge and warning he had just received, and went with the name of his Benefactor on his lips to those who in his hearing had already condemned the Saviour's conduct. The connection is close between the two facts, viz. the man's eager implication of his Healer in the responsibility of his own act, which was said by "the Jews" to be unlawful; and the course of cruel persecution and deadly hate which was there and then inaugurated against the Saviour of the world. The sixteenth verse represents a course of conduct on the part of the Jews which led to open conflict with the dominant party. Christ's view of the sabbath lay, indeed, in the heart of the old Law, and was even recognized by some of the wisest and noblest spirits of Judaism; but it ran counter to the current traditionary interpretation, and cut as with a sharp sabre through the knots and entanglement of the schools. It was the unpardonable sin that ideas and rules which sustained and fed the authority of the hierarchical party should be swept away as valueless and perilous accumulations, and as fungoid encrustations upon the Law of Moses. Weiss justly remarks that there is no colour for the charge that the fourth evangelist antedated the sabbath controversy, for Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>) shows that it had already commenced in Galilee. In <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-3</a> we see that the Pharisaic party distrusted Jesus; here we see that the authorities are in arms against him.

Some critics, eager for disparaging comment, have said "this is point blank denial of the sabbath rest of the Creator as exhibited in <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1, 2</a>, and <a href="../../par/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>. But, on the contrary, it is the true exposition of those grand utterances. God through his Logos, the Father through his Son, did bring his strictly <span class="accented">creative</span> works to an end with the six days; but then he entered on the seventh day, the rest of his preserving, protective, reproductive energy; then he began to pursue his redeeming and quickening operations in all regions of his dominion. My Father worketh, energizes, until now. His "rest" is an infinite activity of wisdom and power, of righteousness and mercy. The true sabbath is this rest of God. Man has to enter into this rest, and cooperate with and utterly abandon himself to the will of God. Sabbath keeping is the great symbol of such entire satisfaction with God. The activities from which man has to cease on the holy day are man's own, man's self-centred labours; but he, too, may combine the highest activity with profound repose. "<span class="accented">My Father worketh until now, and I work</span> - I, who am his Instrument, his Word, his Manifestation, his Messenger, abstaining from all mere self-originated, self-poised, self-centering toil, I <span class="accented">work with him for him.</span> I work obviously and visibly that you may see for yourselves what he has ever been doing silently and unobserved." Philo had said ('Leg. All.,' 1:3) "that God never ceases to create, nor takes a holiday from his works;" and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> had grasped, as an echo of Christ's own teaching, the perpetuity of Divine rest through all the ages of work; but the naked thought here soars far above them both. The dawning of every clay, the opening of the flowers, the flowing of the rivers, the sustenance of vegetable, animal, and human life, reveal through every moment of the agelong sabbath rest, and on every sabbath day, his intense and constant activity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On this account</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is still further defined by the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">therefore the Jews were seeking the more</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. more than</span> they had sought before he made use of this sublime expression) <span class="cmt_word">to slay him, because not only</span> in their opinion, though very falsely, <span class="cmt_word">he was violating</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. dissolving the authority of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the sabbath.</span> Jesus was actually placing the sabbatic law where it has remained ever since, giving it sanctions, beauty, and hold on conscience it had never known before. He was abrogating the petty restrictions and abolishing the unspiritual somnolence by which it had been characterized and misunderstood. But there was  another and more staggering charge which they were not at that moment able to condone. They sought the more to slay him <span class="cmt_word">because he</span> <span class="cmt_word">was calling God his own</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Father, making himself equal to</span>, on a level with, <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. He did use the phrase, "my Father," with a marked emphasis. He did not say, "<span class="accented">our</span> Father, or <span class="accented">your</span> Father;" he assumed a unique relation to the Father. The inmost centre of the Divine consciousness in him thrilled through the human. Though he did not wear now the "form of God," but the "form of the Servant," yet the Servant knew that he was Son and Lord of all. The Divine Personality which had always wrought out the eternal counsels of the Father's will was working now on identical and parallel lines in the human sphere. There were senses in which the Lord Jesus was the own and only begotten Son of God. This was a hard saying. This placing of himself on a level with God was the blasphemy which the Jews resented. Jesus knew what he said, and saw the impression his words produced, and took no steps to correct it. Two classes of result naturally followed. Some said, "He blasphemeth," "He hath a devil," and the high priest subsequently, in reply to a similar utterance of the Lord, rent his clothes; but other some felt concerning him that the relation between him and the Father was, so far as they knew, absolutely unique. The author of this Gospel exclaimed, "He who 'was with God and was God' has been manifested in the flesh, and we saw his glory, the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-29.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">Christ vindicated his equality with the Father.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19, 20a.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">He declares himself to be</span> "<span class="accented">the Son</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore answered and said to them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> replied to their secret thoughts, and to the sentiments of animosity and hostility which they did not conceal. He spake in language of extraordinary solemnity and august claim. The <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily</span>, with which he prefaced the opening sentence, and which he repeated (cf. vers. 24, 25, as in <a href="../../par/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a> and elsewhere) on subsequent occasions, denoted the high ground of authoritative revelation on which he took his stand. He proceeded, without a break or interruption, to assert, on the authority of his own consciousness, the true relation subsisting between <span class="accented">the Son</span> and <span class="accented">the Father</span> - the deep, eternal, sacred link between them; in essence and in affection, in work and function; and gave several illustrations of these matters, the verification of which was not beyond the capacity of his hearers. These he made the basis of the argument of ver. 23, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." What did he wish "the Jews" to understand by "the Son"? Did he identify himself with the Son of whom he here speaks? Surely this is unquestionably the case, for the "answer" here given is one addressed to those who were seeking to slay him because he claimed for himself that God was "his own Father." He had said," My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." He justified the true reverence he felt for the Father when using this language, by describing in various ways the functions, privileges, and work of "the Son." Is "the Son," however, here the Eternal Son, the Logos, before and independently of his incarnation? and are the doctrines here announced an appeal to a pre-existing belief in such a sonship on the part of his enemies, so that he is dealing, at least from vers. 19-23, with the internal relations of the <span class="accented">Godhead</span>? The references to the recent <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and the moral effects which are to be produced upon his hearers by further activity, make this view doubtful. Does he here speak simply of "the Son of man" in his purely dependent, servile capacity, and earthly manifestation? (Watkins). We think not; for the deeds and functions of "the Son" are here so lofty and far reaching that this interpretation is inadmissible. Therefore we conclude, with Meyer and others, that by "the Son" he did mean "the whole subject, the God-Man, the incarnate Logos, in whom the self-determination of action independently of the Father cannot find place." This view of "the Son" involves the continuity of the Logos-consciousness, and not its obliteration; nor is this (as Reuss urges, and even Godet appears in part to concede) incompatible with the Logos-doctrine of the prologue. <span class="cmt_word">The Son is not able to do anything from himself,</span> in the great work of healing, life giving, and redemption, <span class="cmt_word">except that which he seeth the Father doing.</span> The Logos made flesh, the Son who has taken humanity up into his own eternal being, is ever in full contemplation of the Father's activity. He is in intimate and continuous and affectionate relations with the Father, who in this capacity has sent his Son to be the world's Saviour. He sees the Father's healing grace and omnipresent energy and ceaseless activity in regions where "the Jews" fail to discern them. The incarnate Son does not set up a rival throne or authority. He moves, lives, has his being, from the Father and not from himself.

"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee." So stupendous a claim was never exceeded or transcended. "All things that himself doeth," shown and visible to One walking this world. The mind either rebels against or succumbs before such sublime and all-embracing knowledge. No neutrality is possible.

It becomes the recognized phrase by which Christ describes what the world regards as "signs and wonders," "miracles" of power or grace; but it actually connotes the simple activity of God, the normal operation of his hand. Greater manifestations than physical quickening or revival namely, the mighty changes of thought and life, the gifts of grace and peace, eternal life itself, are evermore proceeding. The Father will so show them that the Son will see and do them, and so bring them by revelation to your consciousness <span class="cmt_word">that ye may marvel</span>. Christ will not say here that ye may believe, but that ye may look on confounded and astonished. This was the first effect of Christ's work - Christ's revelation of the Father's heart, Christ's demonstration of the Father's nearness and character. Westcott quotes the apocryphal saying of our Lord preserved by Clement of Alexandria, 'Str.,' 2:9. 45, "He that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest." The wonders of grace will never be exhausted. New combinations, new transformations, new discoveries, new insight into the eternal love, will be effected by him whom God hath sent, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world (but see ver. 28). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-26.</span> - <span class="accented">Greater works: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"></span>(1)</span> <span class="accented">the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> introduces an illustration, a proof of the previous assertion. viz. that the eternal love of the Son would issue in such new marvels) <span class="cmt_word">as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span> This is the most exhaustive expression of the Father's love and revelation to the Son. This thing the Son sees, and this same thing he will do, whether these Jews attempt to put any arrest upon his will or not. The majority of commentators regard vers. 21-27 as descriptive of the moral and spiritual resurrection of dead souls, and hold that a transition is made in vers. 28, 29 to the resurrection of dead bodies and the final consummation. There are some, however, who regard the whole passage - even vers. 28, 29 - as referring, with the previous verses, to <span class="accented">moral</span> resurrection, although the words, "in their tombs" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are there added to give distinctness and explicitness to that future resurrection; and though "now is" of ver. 25 is not there predicated or repeated. Others (with many of the older expositors) refer the entire passage to the <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, which, however, is incompatible with ver. 20 and with the "now <span class="accented">is"</span> of ver. 25. Others, again, see in ver. 21, in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>,, the whole process of resurrection and renewal, both physical and moral, bodily and spiritual. They suppose that in ver. 25 Christ refers first to the spiritual renovation, to be affirmed and consummated in the universal resurrection and judgment of the last day. The generality of the terms <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, attributed to the Father, makes it possible that the Lord was referring to the numerous events of uplifting from the pit, from the lowest <span class="accented">sheol</span>, which formed the staple religious nutrition of the Jewish race. The history of Divine revelation is one lengthened series of interpositions and deliverances, of resurrections of the people of Israel, and of the theocracy from bondage, exile, and spiritual and civil death, and of references to the wonderful transformations of saints and prophets and kings from the depths of despair to the light of life and Divine favour. Ezekiel (37) had likened the most memorable of these resurrections to the uprising of a huge army from a valley of vision, strown with the dry bones of both houses of Israel. "So also," says Jesus, "the Son quiekeneth." including  under this term, it may be, the physical healing which is often the precursor and condition of spiritual awakening and moral health and vigour. The Son, the incarnate Logos, revealing himself on earth, both as Logos and Son of man, <span class="accented">is now quickening after the same fashion whom he will.</span> The will of Christ is in such entire harmony with the Father's will that there is no rivalry here. The will of the Son is in spontaneous accord with the Divine purpose of resurrection and quickening. He is already doing thus here on earth, as the great organ of the Father, that which makes his will the revelation of the Father. There is no arbitrary decree, such as Calvin found here, nor such as Roues insists upon. The emphasis is simply upon the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; and we have in the expression a vindication of the nineteenth verse, "The Son doeth that which he sees the Father doing." His own <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> being the origin and revealed centre on earth of Divine manifestations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - That <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is the point of connection with what follows, and that the Son quickeneth whom he willeth, is more clear, <span class="cmt_word">seeing that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Father even judges no man</span>; judges no man apart from the Son. "Pater non judicat solus nec sine filio, judicat tamen (ver. 45; <a href="../../par/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>)" (Bengel). The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> does not mean exclusively either "condemn" or "acquit," but the exercise of judicial functions which will either acquit or condemn. As in <a href="../../par/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, the "condemnation" is rather <span class="accented">inferred</span> than asserted. Moreover, we are there told that the Son was not sent into the world for the purpose of judgment, but for the larger purposes of salvation, and "to give eternal life." Nevertheless, "life" to some is judgment to others, and judgment even unto death is the obverse of the gift of life when the conditions of life are not found, in <a href="../../par/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a> Christ declares that one solemn <span class="accented">consequence</span> of his coming was <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "unto judgment" - to reveal the final decisions of the Judge. How, then, shall we reconcile these apparently incongruous statements? Judgment unquestionably results from the rejection of the proffer of mercy. The judgment rests on those who say, "We see." Their sin remaineth. Those who are not willing to be made whole remain unhealed. Those who love darkness rather than light abide in the darkness. This is the judgment, but this judicial process was (not the end, but) the consequence of his mission. The Father's ordinary providence, which is always passing judgment upon the lives of men, is now placed in the hands of "the Son." <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit he hath given the whole judgment</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="cmt_word">the judgment in all its parts</span> - <span class="cmt_word">to the Son</span>. He has made the entire juridical process which brings to light the essential tendencies of human hearts, issue from the reception given by man to the Son. The whole question of right against wrong, of life <span class="accented">versus</span> death, acquittal against condemnation, is determined by the attitude of men towards the Son. In many passages this plenipotentiary endowment of "the Son" with functions, powers, authorities, is expressed by this same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>), "he hath given" (ver. 36; <a href="../../par/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-29.htm">John 10:29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2, 4</a>). Meyer limits the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> to "condemnation," and Slier includes in it the separation of sin from the life of believers; but surely the judgment of the world is effected by the light that shines upon it, and the essence of the judgment (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is the discrimination which infailibly follows the revelation of the Father through the Son.

It is surprising that Weiss should declare it "impossible to find any statements here as to the metaphysical unity and equality of the Son and the Father, although current apologetics believe it has succeeded in doing so" ('Life of Christ,' vol. 2:326, note). Luthardt asks, "What other form of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> than that which calls him 'Lord and God' shall belief now assume, than that which the Christian Church cherishes toward Jesus?" Thoma points to <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>, and other great parallels in the New Testament. We gladly accept them, not as proof that the Johannist framed Christ's discourse from them, but as proof that the ideas of St. Paul were not originated by him. but came from the direct assertions of Christ, of which we have the historic trace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a></div><div class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - In this verse the discourse turns from the relations between the Father and the Son, to deal with the relations of the living Christ (the "I," who is speaking throughout) with men. In vers. 21-23, indeed Vers. 19-23, the Lord had been speaking prominently of the ideal sonship, of "the Son" on the Divine side of his  consciousness. The use of the first person, which is here resumed, calls more express attention to the consciousness of his human manifestation, which again reaches its climax in ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you -</span> I, whose voice you now hear, whom you are misunderstanding, rejecting, and seeking to slay. <span class="accented">I say</span> with most solemn emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">He that heareth my word</span> - this term, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, suggests moral as well as physical hearing, and means whosoever allows my thought to penetrate his nature, hears and understands, hears and acts accordingly (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> 5; 13:9, 18; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-22.htm">Revelation 3:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="accented">further <span class="cmt_word"></span>believeth him that sent me;</span> believeth <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that he has borne and is continually bearing true witness concerning me.

To believe on a person, or in one, conveys a different idea from believing that person with regard to any special assertion he may make. Here the belief of God has emphatic reference to the testimony the Father is bearing to the claims of Jesus. Such a hearer, such a believer, <span class="cmt_word">hath eternal life</span>; even here he has entered into the "eternal now;" on earth he is in possession of the blessed consummation. Such belief in words authenticated by the Father's commission is eternal life (cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It lifts a man out of the reach of corruption and condemnation, it ushers him into eternity, it is an eternal blessedness in itself; <span class="cmt_word">and he cometh not to judgment, but has passed from the death, into the life.</span> He is already translated from the death state to the renewed, quickened state. The decision and discrimination between him and the world have taken place. The judgment is over, the books are closed, the condemnation is no longer possible. He will not perish, he has eternal life. "The believer is tree from the judgment which executes itself in the exclusion inflicted on the unbeliever, by the revelation of Jesus as the Light, because he is already in possession of the saving blessing" (Luthardt). Judgment, being completed, does not require repetition" (Godet). "When that confidence in Christ has illumined the heart wherein we recognize that we have been verily accepted, listened to, ruled, and defended by God, peace follows, and high joyfulness, which is the realization of eternal life, and which covers the sins that erewhile had clung to our weakness" (Melancthon). In this life of faith "we taste the powers of the world to come," "our citizenship is in heaven." "This eternal life is a veritable resurrection of the dead" (Augustine). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a></div><div class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - Once more the solemn asseveration, <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you</span>, is repeated, when our Lord still further emphasized the authority of his own word, the Father's confirmation of its accuracy, and the Divine signature and testimony to its power. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is coming, and now is.</span> There will be more wonderful attestations to the truth than any which as yet have broken the silence of the grave. Not only will the physically dead rise from their bier or their grave in the fulness and strength of resume, life, but the spiritually dead in vast multitudes will pass from death into eternal life, will know that the bitterness of death is over, and that there shall be no more condemnation for them. The Holy Spirit was, when Jesus spake, about to convict the world of sin, and to unveil the glory of Christ to the eye of faith. Pentecost would confirm the word of Jesus, for the Spirit will bear witness to the reality of the risen Lord. But whereas that hour was only "coming," that marvellous day had yet to dawn upon the world, Jesus added it <span class="accented">now</span> <span class="accented">is</span> - while I am speaking the reality of this vast spiritual change is taking place. There are proofs enough already. "Now," already, at this very moment, <span class="cmt_word">the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God</span>. The spiritually dead shall be disturbed in their slumber and roused from their indifference, be made to know that the summons of supreme power and authority is addressed to them. Emphasis is laid upon the <span class="accented">Divine</span> force which is at work upon heart and conscience. "The Son of God," not "a son of man" merely, is uttering his voice. <span class="cmt_word">And they that have heard</span> - accepted the summons, "heard the word," and believed, not merely him that sent me (the teaching of ver. 24), but that he who has been sent is none other than the "Son of God" - these, said Christ, shall live. The form of the expression <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> can only designate those who <span class="accented">give ear</span>, and by this the literal resurrection of all the dead is excluded. The teaching of this verse reasserts the teaching of ver. 24, and adds to it, and clothes the truth in the imagery of the general resurrection. The awful suggestion is involved that many of these dead ones will hear the voice of the Son of God, and not give heed to it. Hengstenberg endeavours to overthrow this  general interpretation of the verse, making it equivalent to vers. 27, 28 rather than an expansion of ver. 24. The "now is," according to him, covers the whole period to the second advent, and the future <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> points to a future epoch in the <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. But the emphatic omission of the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the later and more explicit statement is against such a view, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is best explained by its adaptation to the whole clause. "The hour is coming" as well as "now is." The <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> "shall live," rather than shall be "made alive," is far more applicable to the resurrection of dead souls than of defunct bodies. It is equivalent to "have eternal life" of the previous verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a></div><div class="verse">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - This verse, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, shows that the statement about to follow will sustain some portion of the previous one. Which portion? As it seems to me, the coming clause justifies the alteration of the term "the Son" <span class="accented">into</span> "the Son of God;" and declares, more fully than any other passage in the New Testament, the lofty and unique character of the Sonship which he claimed. <span class="cmt_word">For even as the Father hath life in himself</span> - the sublime assumption of the self-existence and eternal being of the Father, the absolute Possessor of life <span class="accented">per se</span>, the Source ultimate and efficient of all that is connoted by life, the eternal Fountain of life - <span class="cmt_word">in like manner also he gave to the Son to have Life in himself</span>. "He generated," as Augustine has it, "such a Son who should have life in himself, not as a participator in life, but one who should be as he himself is - Life itself." It is the <span class="accented">bona fide</span> expression of community of nature, attribute, quality, and possession of Godhead. In virtue of this utterance, the evangelist, learning from the consciousness of Christ through long years of meditation, under the power of the Spirit, eventually formulated the doctrine of the prologue, "In him was life." "The Son," or the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>, is, so far as this Sonship is concerned, the veritable Son of God with such a fulness of life power and such a fountain of life flowing from him, that his voice is the voice of the Eternal Son. This is the primary meaning, though since the Lord returned to his use of the word "the Son," and since the word "gave" is also employed to denote the stupendous conception, there is also involved in it the declaration that the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>, seeing he is both Son of God and Son of man, is endowed with all the functions of both. In his incarnation he has not lost the infinite fulness of life giving power. "He quickeneth whom he will," having life in himself. His voice is the voice of the Son of God. The glory of the Word who became flesh was the glory of the Only Begotten. The part which this great passage took in the Arian controversy is well known (see Athanasius, 'Discourses against Arians,' 3:3, translated by J.H. Newman). Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the position that the Lord here speaks of "life in himself," which was given to the Son (God-Man) in virtue of, and as the reward of his sacrificial work. He points to <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>, etc. But Jesus here speaks of a gift already made. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a></div><div class="verse">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-29.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Second</span> "<span class="accented">greater work"</span> - <span class="accented">judgment of the world.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gave him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Son, the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>authority to execute judgment,</span> <span class="cmt_word">because he is Son of man.</span> He has vindicated his power to confer life upon the dead by asserting the possession by "the Son" of the Divine Sonship. He now adds, so far as the relation to man is concerned, his fitness and authority to administer justice, to preside over the entire juridical process, to lift the scales, to determine the destiny of the human race. The fitness is seen in this, that he, "the Son," is "the Son of man." The one term, "THE SON," entirely covers the twofold Sonship. The proof of his humanity is assumed to be complete. The fact of it is the ground that he who knows what is in man should be the Judge of men. By personal experience of man's temptations and frailties; by knowing every palliation of our sins, every extenuation of our failures, every aggravation of our weakness; by gazing through human eyes with human consciousness upon our mysterious destiny, he is competent to judge; whereas by being Son of God as well as Son of man, he is entrusted with power to execute the judgment of the Eternal. The principle involved is based upon perfect justice. The honour thus conferred on the God-Man is infinite, the consolation thus held out to man unspeakable. We are being judged by Christ, not by impersonal law. The entire incidence upon every individual of the Law is in the hands of the Redeemer. The Saviour, the Life-giver, the Voice which quickens the dead, assigns the judgment. We must be careful, in any inference we draw from this grand utterance, to avoid all suspicion of schism or rivalry between the Father and the Son. The Son is not more merciful than the Father. For the Father  of the Old Testament pitieth his children, and knoweth their frame (<a href="../../par/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13, 14</a>), and the Father of Jesus Christ loves the world, and counts the very hairs of our heads. The Son will not exercise this judgment with less regard to the claims of eternal justice than the Father; but his knowledge of humanity is, by the nature of the case, a guarantee of such application of the justice of God to the case of every individual, that man's knowledge of himself will be able personally to justify and verify it. The Divine judgment will go forth from the heart of man himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28</a></div><div class="verse">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - It is impossible not to draw a distinction between the theme of these verses and that of vers. 24, 25. The Lord announces an event which is in the future altogether. The "and now is," which characterized the first resurrection of which he spoke, is here omitted. The description of the subjects of the resurrection as those "in their graves," contradistinguishes them from "the dead" of ver. 25 - a phrase which will suffer several interpretations. The universality of the summons, and the impossibility of neglecting it or ignoring it, form another marked contrast to the resurrection already referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not at this!</span> At what? Clearly at the entire statement that the resurrection of dead souls will be the undoubted issue of accepting Christ's word and identifying it with the word of God. <span class="accented">Marvel</span> not that the judgment of the world is entrusted to "the Son," because he is both Son of man as well as Son of God. "Marvel not" is a relative word. It means obviously that there is a greater marvel still in store. <span class="cmt_word">Because the hour is coming;</span> always coming, though it seemeth long - coming swiftly, measured on the great clock face of the universe. Geological time, astronomical aeons, should before this have rebuked our impertinence about the delays of God, and our shallow criticism of the fulness of the times. "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." As compared with geological annals, still less with God's eternities, it is only the day before yesterday when Adam fell; it is only yesterday that Jesus died and rose again, and tomorrow that he will come in his glory. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is coming when all who are in the graves shall hear his voice.</span> The same voice that wakes the spiritually dead shall pierce the clods, shall find the buried dead, shall bring once more into the world of the visible and tangible the long forgotten lived. Every solitary life lives with him and before him. The organic clothing of the spirit, which goes on, as St. Paul suggests (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>) from the death of the physical body till the coming of the Son of God with glory, does not render this statement more difficult, but more comprehensible. As far as this world is concerned, those who are clothed upon with the house not made with hands - those who are with Christ, are to all appearance dead, and in their "graves," in their memorial places; but they will all hear the voice of the Son, <span class="cmt_word">and they will come, forth; they that have</span> <span class="cmt_word">done</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> <span class="cmt_word">things, to the resurrection of life; they that have practised evil things, to the resurrection of judgment</span>. They will come forth from these hiding places of fading memories. Even tombs of prophets and kings are themselves buried, covered by the graves of the many generations that have followed. The grave hidden will come forth into what we call the reality, visibility, tangibility, of things. The hour is coming on apace when Death himself shall be dead, and the mystery of time be finished. They that rise will divide themselves into two classes. The anastasis will have two forms. There is a "resurrection of life" and a "resurrection of judgment." Those who have indeed passed from spiritual death to life will not come into "judgment" (not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) when their anastasis is complete, their judgment is over, their life is secure. When those who have not heard the voice of the Son of God, have not come to the light, who are not of God nor of the truth - men who have deliberately practised "evil things" without compunction or amendment, - when these are called from their tombs, from their shadowy hiding places, into the presence of him who executes judgment, it will be to undergo the (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) judgment (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). We must, indeed, all be made manifest before the judgment throne of Christ, to receive the consequences of "the doing of well" and "the practice of evil." The issue of the one is <span class="accented">life</span>, and of the other is <span class="accented">judgment.</span> The suggestion seems to be that such judgment may issue unfavourably, but the thought is centred upon the process of the judgment. The effort of Reuss and others to draw a marked distinction between the eschatology of the synoptists and of John fails. Christ does not represent the spiritual resurrection as "greater work" than the physical resurrection. On the contrary, white he speaks of the <span class="accented">marvelling</span> of his hearers at his claim to quicken the spiritually dead, yet the ground of their  marvel is emphatically arrested (see ver. 28) until they should recognize to the full the fact that, as Son of God and Son of man, he would call all the dead from their graves. Thoma finds admirable justification for this representation by the Johannist of the Messianic Judge, alike in the Book of Daniel, in the synoptic Gospels, in the Pauline Epistles, and Apocalypse!

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a></div><div class="verse">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-40.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="accented">The witness borne to these claims.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - The Lord, still preserving the consciousness of his own <span class="accented">ego</span>, continues to speak through human lips to human ears. He deprecates the criticism, "Who and what canst thou be, that thou shouldst execute judgment, or bring us to thy bar, or compel us to come from our hidden places to thy judgment seat?" It is not as mere man that he will judge the world; God will judge through trim. Moreover, the equality of "life" and "honour" and "authority" that he has with the Father, as the veritable Son of God, is nevertheless a life derived, a being generated, an honour given. He here opens up on this basis a new class of instruction, and proceeds to explain the threefold nature of the testimony borne to his present claim to be the Representative and coAgent of the Father. He goes back in these words to the great text of the discourse, viz. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" (ver. 19). I (the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span> is very emphatic, the individual standing before them associates himself, and is identified, with the one Being who, as Son of God and Son of man, has done, is doing, and will yet do, wonderful things) - <span class="cmt_word">I can of mine own self,</span> from any separate or self-originating source in myself, apart from the Father, <span class="cmt_word">do nothing.</span> He subsequently said to his disciples, "Without me ye can do nothing." He claims a higher source than himself for all his own power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). When referring to the same subject (vers. 19, 20), he drew his illustration from the sense of sight. The Father "shews" to him, and he "sees" all things that the Father doeth. Here he adds, with special reference to the last and consummating manifestation of relation with the Father, <span class="cmt_word">As I hear, I judge: and my judgment of men is righteous; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him</span> <span class="cmt_word">who sent me</span>. Christ refers to his judgments of absolution or condemnation upon things or men, positively declaring them to be either right or wrong; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> he claimed the power to say, "Thy sins be forgiven;" "The faith hath saved thee;" "It is better for this man that he had never been born;" "Come unto me;" "Depart from me;" "I never knew you." These and all his other judgments on scribes and Pharisees, on devils and hypocrites, on Pilate and Herod, on Jerusalem and the world, are revelations of the Father's mind - are in themselves just judgments, absolutely free from any selfhood, from any reflex influence or reaction from men to himself. They are the true and infallible expression of the Divine will. Because of the entire conformity of his will and himself to the Divine will, the judgment must correspond to that which is, in its very nature, right and true. If this be so, we can scarcely refrain from asking, "Wherein, then, lies the consolation and encouragement derivable from the fact that the execution of judgment is placed for man's sake in the hands of the Son of man?" It lies here, that the Incarnation is perfect; that the manhood has not obliterated the Divinity, nor the Godhead absorbed the manhood, of the Christ. The human consciousness of the Son becomes the basis for the Father's judgment, which is uttered thus absolutely and finally through human lips. It is impossible to imagine thoughts like these arising in the mind of some thinker of the second century. Great as the prologue to this Gospel unquestionably is, this unveiling of the heart of the Son of God incarnate is immeasurably greater. The consciousness of Christ is unique. Neither legend nor imagination, to say nothing of history, has ever transcended it. Here, too, the enormous difference between the Johannine Christ and the Philonic Logos comes into startling prominence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31</a></div><div class="verse">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - At this point the Lord proceeds to meet the clamour which most probably arose, the doubt and questioning which broke the silence with which his solemn defence had been received. We can hear between the lines the cries of an excited crowd, declaring that these words are simply his own. Such testimony as this to himself must be sustained and sanctioned. Why and how can this Teacher take such ground as to assert about himself what no prophet, no rabbi, no chief priest of the people, not even the greatest man of men, Moses himself, had ever dared to claim? Christ admits that such assumptions as these need justification and approval over and above his <span class="accented">ipse dixit.</span> The words that follow are startling: <span class="cmt_word">If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true.</span> At first sight this is in direct contradiction to <a href="../../par/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>, where, in reply to the Pharisees' "Thou  bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is nor true," he replied, "<span class="accented">Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true</span>; because I know whence I came, and whither I go." The absolute unison with the Father, which he was not only conscious of, but had also revealed to the Pharisees, lifted his own word to the grandeur of a word of God. The Divine beamed through the human, the infinite through the finite. Here he says, "<span class="accented">If I bear</span> - if I and I alone were bearing <span class="accented">witness</span> to myself," then - supposing a case, which, as a matter of fact, is impossible - "<span class="accented">my</span> <span class="accented">witness is not true."</span> If he were acting alone, which is an inconceivable supposition, seeing that in the depths of his consciousness he knew that he was one with the Father, then for his human nature to break away thus from the Father and disdain his testimony would nullify and falsify his witness. He is not bearing witness alone. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-32.htm">John 5:32</a></div><div class="verse">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 37, 38.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">The witness of the Father.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is another that witnesseth concerning me; and</span> <span class="cmt_word">I know that the witness which he witnesseth concerning me is true</span>. It is a mistake, with Ewald, De Wette, and many others, to suppose that this refers to the testimony of John the Baptist. By Augustine, Hengstenberg, Luthardt, Godet, Meyer, etc., it has been perceived that the "other" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) refers to the Father. Jesus expressly declines to receive John's testimony as his justification or sufficient vindication, and he contrasts it with the higher confirmation which in three distinct ways is already and continuously vouchsafed to him. The present tense, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, is in striking contrast to the testimony of John already silenced by imprisonment or death. The methods of this testimony are subsequently analyzed and described. The Father's witness includes -

The sending to John was probably a reference to the official transaction described in <a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>. This is not the "other" whom he referred to, for in the next clause he made solemn disclaimer of resting his claim upon John or upon any individual man. The witness of the forerunner was a true one. The function of the prophet is to bear witness to the Light, to strip off the veils which hide it, to call attention to its most solemn realities, to quicken vision, to stimulate conscience, to disturb apathy, to discern the coming and prepare the way of the Lord (see <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5</a>, notes), He was not the Light; but he did call attention to a testimony immeasurably more precious than any word proceeding merely from human lips. The testimonies of John, both before and after he came into contact with Christ, were very wonderful and were adapted to exert and did produce a deep impression upon the people for a time; but by themselves they would not have given sufficient ratification to the Lord's words. We may welcome still all Johannine, ministerial testamonies to the Lord. but the power of God himself must assert itself to the inner consciousness bet, re any man receives the gospel. No mere human testimony to such claims as these rises to the dignity of the occasion. Unless the Father's witness can be discerned, supreme, convincing, and final, John's witness would be insufficient. It may arrest attention, it may impress the apathetic, it may overawe the gainsayers; but it is not final, nor does it leave the hearers without excuse. All the rhetoric, all the threatening, all the irony, of Elijah would have failed if the fire of the Lord had not fallen to consume the sacrifice.

But this is unnecessary, for emphasis is laid on the article, "the witness," which is real, infallible, convincing, commanding, must come from the highest source of all. Yet, though Christ cannot depend upon John's testimony, it ought to have had weight with his hearers. It called them to repentance, to holy living, to faith in the Coming One. It discounted their pride in Abrahamic birth, and their false notions of race purity; it made personal and individual that which had been looked at as a national monopoly of privilege. Nay, more, it had testified that he was the "Lamb of God" and the "Son of God" and the "Bridegroom of the Church." Therefore he continued: <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit, these things I say -</span> I call attention to the sum total of his message, the testimony he bore to truth - <span class="cmt_word">that ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">may be saved;</span> for all that John said was true. "John did no miracle: but all things that he said concerning Jesus were true" (<a href="../../par/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a>; see notes). If the Jews had accepted the testimony of John, they wound not now be cherishing angry and rebellious thought, and have been so blinded to the truth and reality of things. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a></div><div class="verse">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was the lamp</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that burneth and shineth.</span> He was not the Light, but came to bear witness to  the Light (<a href="../../par/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8</a>). The glory of his appearance was a derived or kindled illumination (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>). (It is not against this inference that in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> the Lamb is the Lamp of the New Jerusalem.) The household lamp or torch, when kindled, burns with more or less brilliance, but burns itself out, exhausts itself. One may walk in the light of it, see the way one should take, discharge duties that would otherwise be impossible, avoid perils that might without the lamp prove disastrous or destructive; but the capacity of the torch is soon reduced to a minimum. Bengel, Stier, Alford, think that the celebrated passage in Ecclus. 48:1 may be referred to: "Then stood up Elijah the prophet like as a fire, and his word burned as a lamp." This is not impossible, though it would stand alone as a distinct reference in the Gospels to any apocryphal book. Lunge has given a long series of the lamp and fire symbols of the Old Testament; the group of events in which the Lord appeared in flames of fire and clouds of glory, from <a href="../../par/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> to <a href="../../par/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, affirming John to be "the flame signal of Messiah, the last Old Testament form of the pillar of fire and candlestick of the temple, therefore the lamp at once flaming and shining." More than this, and more to the point, we find that, under the figure of lamps of fire, the messengers of God, the activities of the Church, here repeatedly set forth (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). John was <span class="accented">the burning lamp</span>, not the archetypal Light. <span class="cmt_word">Ye desired for a season to rejoice in his light</span>. Many interpretations have been suggested, such as the exultation of a wedding party in the brief light of the torch bearer, announcing the approach of the bridegroom; or the dancing of ephemerides in the glitter of a lamp. The metaphor is lost in the solemn memory of the high gratification for a season which the populations of Judaea, Galilee, and the wilderness had manifested on the apparition of the great prophet. The universal acclaim soon subsided. The leaders of the people fell back when they heard John's call to repentance. Publicans and harlots pressed into the kingdom before the scribes and Pharisees. "The generation of vipers" did to John "whatsoever they listed." The secular power hushed his voice and crushed the man. "For a season" only did they listen to his word or respond to his challenge. His great testimony, though given to him by God, and by no means proceeding from his mere human consciousness, had been in the main unheeded. Wunsche quotes from 'Sota,' fol. 21, <span class="accented">a</span>, "Rabbi Menahem said that Solomon (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>) compares 'prayer' with 'lamp,' and 'teaching' with 'light,' because the one flashes for the twinkling of an eye, comforts in the moment during which it shines; while the other, like the shining of the sun, burns evermore, and leads to eternal rest." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a></div><div class="verse">But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> <span class="accented">The witness of the works. <span class="cmt_word"></span>But the witness which I have is greater</span> <span class="cmt_word">than</span> [that] <span class="cmt_word">of John</span>. The testimony of John was memorable and uoteworthy in many respects. If the people had accepted it, they would have admitted the Divine authority of One who was "mightier" than John. The synoptic Gospels show that Jesus made a similar appeal to the conscience of his critics on a later occasion (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-25.htm">Matthew 21:25</a>, and parallels). Though John's baptism was "from heaven," and though John's testimony was "great," yet that which accompanied the ministry of Jesus was "greater" still. The words of John were not merely John's words, or they would have been valueless. Moreover, "the testimony that I have" is in itself convincing; it has a Divine, self-evidencing force, which, added to my word, confirms and establishes my claim. The proof or illustration of this is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">For the works which the Father hath given me that I should bring them to completion, the very works, which I am doing, bear witness concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.</span> The works of Christ are his normal activities - the deeds which express the nature and compass of his will, and indicate the qualities of his Person. They would be <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, should any other perform such things or live on such a platform of exalted activity. They are his "works." This term is often used for the special manifestations of his alliance with the supernatural, Divine realm (<a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25, 32</a>, etc.; John 14:10; 15:24). They are in their fulness and summation the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Lord (<a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>). They are, moreover, "given" to him to "do" or to "finish." This idea is frequently expressed. "All things are <span class="accented">given</span> into his hand" (<a href="../../par/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>), all judgment is <span class="accented">given</span> him to execute (<a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22, 27</a>). The Father hath <span class="accented">given</span> him self-existence (ver. 26; cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2, 6, 9, 12, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-9.htm">John 18:9</a>). It is impossible to dissociate these "works "from those great miracles which ought to command assent to his claims, even if, alas! his bare words are not sufficiently convincing. John's Gospel makes numerous references to these proofs of the Divine commission, these illustrations as well as evidences of his right to speak. But the "works" are  not limited to the miraculous healings, to multiplication of breed and wine, and resurrection from the dead. The whole of his work, from his baptism and temptation to his own resurrection from the dead, was his <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. This was made up of all the self-revelation of his life, of all his consecration and sympathy, of all his character, of all the resuscitation of dead souls, of all the joy he was pouring into broken hearts, and all the life he was evoking in moribund humanity. "These works that I am doing bear witness concerning me, that the Father hath sent me." They are of such a character that he confidently declares about them that they proclaim his Divine commission. The entire work, reaching special expression in certain typical acts and deeds, was greater than the verbal testimony which John bare to his mission. All that John said was true, but Christ's "works" prove it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a></div><div class="verse">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - <span class="accented">The witness of the Father further elucidated.</span> (See ver. 32.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Father</span> (<span class="cmt_word">himself</span>), <span class="cmt_word">who sent me</span>. (<span class="cmt_word">he</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hath borne witness concerning me</span>. If the "himself" be the genuine reading (and it is defended by Godet, M'Clellan, and Meyer), there would seem to be a special or direct and additional form of the Father's testimony. And several ancient and modern critics (Chrysostom, Bengel, Paulus, Godet) have seen in it a reference to the special "voice and shape" which were heard and teen by John and Jesus at the baptism, when heaven was opened, when a voice from heaven proclaimed him to be the well beloved and only begotten Son of God, and when the Spirit of God descended as a dove and abode upon him. This testimony was only given to the world through the consciousness and word of John, who, after receiving it, bore record that this was the Son of God. Meyer and many others, rather following the suggestion of De Wette that the inward drawing of the Father to the Son was that to which the Lord referred, would thus complete the testimony of the "works." This testimony, then, which is cited against the challenge, "Thou bearest witness concerning thyself," would be a purely subjective one. Westcott thinks it refers to the whole of the Old Testament ministry and prophetic and typical anticipation of the Christ, culminating in John the Baptist. This particular series of testimonies is referred to in vers. 39 and 47, etc. Moulton, who rejects the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> sees no new, no direct, testimony in addition to that of the works, but the assertion that they are the voice of the Father - in a sense the very form of the Father, for the conviction of those who might if they would come to him. If the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> must be retained, I think that we must suppose our Lord referring to the whole of those objective manifestations of the Father's will and mind concerning Christ which were outside of his own act or work; and all that shining through his face, that whispering through his word of what was the eternal Father's face and voice, and plainly distinguished from the work of the Son; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the angels' song, the miraculous providence which protected his childhood, the opening of heaven at his baptism, the Divinity which attended him and which made his ministry so strange and strong an influence. Nor could he who had the whole of his life before him fail to be conscious of further testimonies from heaven and from Providence which, though unrecorded, would continue to set their seal upon his character and work. We must never forget that our Lord himself was a revelation of <span class="accented">the Son.</span> But the revelation of the Son in his <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> was accompanied throughout with another manifestation - that <span class="accented">of the Father.</span> The glory of the Lord shone round about him. Nevertheless, a difficulty is conceded as arising out of the unsusceptibility and limited opportunities of his hearers. <span class="cmt_word">Never have ye heard a voice of him, or seen a form of him.</span> These voices and these sounds need opened ears and unsealed eyes. You (says Christ) have not heard that which you might have heard. You have not seen that which you might have seen. On a subsequent occasion he said to one of his disciples, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. How sayest thou, then, Show us the Father?" So that there was, indeed, the condition of adequate revelation of the Father provided for the disciples in the life of Christ, in the ministry of the Son of the Father. Moreover, it far exceeded the vision of God which was granted to patriarchs and prophets under the Old Testament dispensation. Doubtless the voice of Jehovah had been heard (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>), the face of Jehovah had been seen (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4, 24</a>). Isaiah saw the glory of the Angel of the Lord (6; cf. <a href="../../par/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>), and Ezekiel likewise by the river of Chebar (Ezekiel 3:23). Nevertheless, the evangelist, on the credit of the great utterance before us, has laid down, as the very climax of the prologue, "No man hath seen God at any time (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared  him." This language of the <span class="accented">prologue</span> shows that the true revelation of the Father's heart was not even granted to the noblest of the seers and patriarchs. Such manifestations as the visions of the Old Testament saints were not the veritable voice or form of the Father. Should mankind ever obtain vision or audition of the Father, it must be through the presence among them of him who had been forever in the bosom of the Father. Though these captious critics were in a position to have received this revelation of the Highest, they had not done so. "<span class="accented">Ye have neither heard a voice of him, nor seen a form of him.</span> You might have seen and heard and handled if you had chosen, but You will not come to me, you will not believe me, you will not yield to my claims as One sent to you from the Father!"

The reason given is, <span class="cmt_word">Because him whom he</span> (the Father) <span class="cmt_word">sent, him</span> (this One) <span class="cmt_word">ye believe not.</span> In other words, "Your lack of faith in me accounts for your perverse misconception, for your inability to see and hear all that there is of the Father's personal testimony to me." Some suspect a <span class="accented">petitio principii</span> in this argument, but the reasoning seems to be this; there is abundant evidence, corroboration, and cooperative glory, affirming the truth of all that Christ has said about himself as the Source of life and Judge of man; but the moral susceptibility of his hearers is paralyzed, and their faith in the most fundamental facts of their own experience is at fault. They seem impervious, not only to Christ's Word, but to the corroborative testimonies themselves. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a></div><div class="verse">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39, 40.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> <span class="accented">The witness of the Scriptures.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye search the Scriptures.</span> A large number of commentators, from Chrysostom and Augustine to Luther, Tholuck, Hengstenberg, M'Clellan, Luthardt, and Ewald, with the Authorized Version, regard this as an imperative command. This is grammatical, and corresponds to the language of <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; but with Cyril, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Godet, Lange, Westcott, Plummer, Watkins, we think the whole context demands the indicative. The second clause, "because in them," etc., follows far more obviously upon an assertion than upon a precept. The "ye will not" that follows is far more in harmony with the indicative than with the supposed command. The Lord says, "You have a third great testimony to my claim, and yet you are not prepared to accept it." <span class="accented">Ye search the Scriptures.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is used (<a href="../../par/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) for minute, prolonged search. The kind of investigation which the rabbis spent upon the text and letter of the Holy Scriptures is a proverb, and led to the allegorical mystical meanings of the Genesisaras and other Hebrew literature. "Ye search the Scriptures" rather than the living Word, rather than the Divine meaning and message from the living God which they do contain. This is one term out of many which the Lord employed for the sacred literature which was the great heritage of the Hebrew people. Elsewhere he called it "the Law," "the Law and prophets," "Moses and the prophets," "your Law," "the wisdom of God." He admits their study, prolonged and eager, of the sacred writings, and he justifies the ground and motive of such search, viz.: <span class="cmt_word">because ye think in them ye have eternal life</span>; or, <span class="accented">ye shall have</span>, or <span class="accented">shall find, eternal life.</span> Some powerful critics, like Meyer, urge that our Lord agrees so far with the Jews, that he sympathizes with their search, and that censure or ironical language would be inconsistent with the Saviour's reverence for the Scriptures. But the expression is very unusual on that hypothesis, "Ye think [or, 'imagine'] ye have in them," rather than "ye have through them." Surely our Lord is here condemning the superstitious idea that, in the mere possession of the letter, they were possessors of the eternal life; that, apart from the indwelling Word, apart from the heart of the message itself, some magical advantage was springing. Hillel, whoso view of Scripture may be expressed in a saying ('Aboth,' 2:8), "He who has gotten to himself words of the Law hath gotten to himself the life of the world to come," here differs utterly from the Lord, who, on the doctrine of Holy Scripture, takes ground similar to that which he had taken with reference to the temple and the sabbath. It is not the bare possession of the Scriptures, nor the prolonged examination of its mere letter, that is the condition of eternal life. "Search" which is originated and stimulated by a vague idea of the life-giving force of the letter, is illusive. We may <span class="accented">think</span> that in them we have eternal life, but our Lord would undeceive us. Moreover, from the depths of his own consciousness and knowledge of his own mission, he adds: <span class="cmt_word">And they are they which testify concerning me.</span> This is one of the keynotes of New Testament teaching, viz. Christ's idea of the Old Testament, that it  was a sketch or portraiture drawn in successive ages and on various material of himself - that it was an outline of great principles which he was about, <span class="accented">not</span> to rub out, but to fill in, not "to destroy, but to fulfil." The histories, the experiences, the ceremonial, the dynasties; the offices, the songs and prayers, the predictive and typical sorrows there depicted, were all prelibations and unconscious prophecies of himself. "They testify concerning me," and, together with my works and with my forerunner and, more than all, with my Father's own voice speaking and my Father's own face shining through all, they complete the manifold testimony to the fact that I have come to do his will, to work with him, to deliver, to restore, to give life, and to execute judgment also, when my hour is come. If this be so, then strange, inconsistent, and tragic is the ultimate issue - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a></div><div class="verse">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</span> This fearful conclusion of the whole matter is charged upon the responsibility of man. Doubtless, elsewhere, the will is described as itself made willing by the Divine attraction, by the grace of the Father. "He that <span class="accented">hath seen and heard of the Father</span> [seen, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his shape and heard his voice - seen his shape and heard his voice in my ministry and manifestation], <span class="accented">cometh unto me."</span> Yet the grace of God working directly on character or indirectly by other revelations, never obliterates the sense of responsibility. The appeal of God is made to the will of man, whether we consciously or unconsciously are made "willing in the day of his power" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44, 67</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). The sad tone of this solemn charge corresponds with and does much to explain the pathetic cry, "O Jerusalem... how often would I have gathered thy children...  and ye would not!" while the entire passage suggests that this appeal was only one specimen out of many such discourses, one hint of the numerous sayings and self-manifestations, one of many accumulated proofs of his Divine commission, out of which the belief of the evangelists and the invincible assent of the Church arose, that he was indeed "the Word made flesh," "the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."

"They would not come." Everything was prepared, but none were ready or willing to accept even so rich a blessing as life itself. This is the refrain of the whole Bible: "Ye will not; .... Ye would not;" "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" "I called, and ye refused;" "I wrote the great things of my Law; ye have counted them as strange things." Our Lord proceeds in the closing words to account in some respects for this unwillingness. <span class="cmt_word">I receive not glory from men, but I know you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, I have come by experience or intuition to such knowledge of you), <span class="cmt_word">that you have not the love of God in you</span>. The love of God is the principle of all obedience; and Christ elsewhere declares it to be the first and great commandment of the Law. But love is the principle of all knowledge. "He that loveth not knoweth not." This principle reaches its fullest expression when we learn the greater truth that "God is love." It is true of all objects of love, the highest kind of knowledge is not possible without love. This is pre-eminently the case when we think of knowing God. Since God is essential Love, without experiencing love we cannot realize that Divine essence. Again, there is an elementary faith that precedes elementary love, but when love is once awakened, faith again deepens, and love grows by what it feeds upon, until the faith becomes vision and the love rapture. But why the opening words, <span class="accented">I receive not glory from men</span>? Probably they intimate opposition and questioning to some such effect as this: "Thou hast declared thyself the Giver of life and resurrection, and charged our lack of spiritual life upon our unwillingness to believe these claims and to submit ourselves to these exalted assumptions or to go to thee for life. Thou art eager, after all, for our approval and glory." To this Christ replied, "<span class="accented">Glory from men I receive not.</span> It is not for my sake, but for yours, I say, 'Come unto me and live;' but, alas! having searched you through and through, I discern no love, none of the spirit out of which the forces of faith can be evolved. The reason why you are unwilling to come to me for life is that you are measuring me by yourselves, and have not that self-emptying and abnegation and distrust out of which faith and love, love and faith, must ever spring."

Christ did not profess to have come in his own name. He was not a mere evolution of humanity, or of Israel, or of the house of David. He was the Only Begotten of the Father, born from above, sent down from heaven. The language of the world was, "This is not Divine;" "It is too gentle, too gracious, too sympathetic for  God!" The religious world listened eagerly for some echo of the trumpet peals of Sinai. It desired a king greater than Solomon, a prophet more terrible than Elijah. When he came with the real glory robes of the love of God, and with the majesty of the Name of the Lord, there was widespread disappointment and cruel rejection of his commission. <span class="cmt_word">Should another come in his own</span> (proper, peculiar) <span class="cmt_word">name</span>, that is, with no testimony from heaven, seeking "honour (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, glory) from men," creating a sovereignty by enlisting the voices of men, compromising with evil, making no warfare against the power of the world, allowing the legitimacy of the throne of the prince of this world; - should he come in his own name, alas! <span class="cmt_word">him</span> (that one) <span class="cmt_word">ye will receive.</span> The eagerness on the part of the Jews to find the Messiah has led them to accept in some sort no fewer than sixty-four false Christs (Schudt, 'Judische Merkwurdigkeit,' 6:27-30; Bengel and Meyer). Nor must the Christian Church take the flattering unction that it is free from this charge. The teacher that can utilize to the widest extent the fashionable worldliness, and can mingle the pungent human condiment with the princely food of the King's banqueting house, is he who at the present hour meets with the loudest response and the readiest reception. There is solemn warning here for statesman and author, artist and preacher.

First, he insisted that he had searched their hearts, and found there none of that elementary "love of God" which is the prime condition of knowledge or faith. Then he showed that an appreciation on their part of the type of character antithetic to his own, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the man who comes in his own name and seeks his glory from men, must blind them to that which is most characteristic of himself. They will receive the prophet, the pseudo-Christ, for the very reason that makes his own mission so unpalatable. He strikes right across their taste, their passion, their prejudice. He now lays down a new or modified statement of one of the prime conditions of spiritual faith. There is a universal desire for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, glory, of some sort. The original meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> here almost forces itself into the text. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> "opinion," thought, and the good opinion which one person may entertain with reference to another. The glory of a Greek citizen was the good opinion of his fellow citizens or fellow countrymen. God's "glory" is the universal judgment of all intelligences, including his own concerning himself. The highest "glory" of man is the approval of Almighty God; the "opinion" which is absolutely true and is not mingled or contaminated with any flattering fictions. The minds which deliberately ignore this highest and only true source of glory, and substitute for it the glory of the ignorant plaudits and unreal approval, and unhesitating homage of the clique to which they belong, are m a moral condition incapacitating them to believe in the Christ. How should they? How can they? It is not possible for that man to believe Christ at all whose mind is so befogged, whose moral judgments are so dislocated. "The only God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), (see <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>). The use of this epithet in the Fourth Gospel is of singular value. Moreover, in this very connection the Son is so exalted above the world, and the Father comes so close to man in Christ, that we cannot wonder that Gnosticism and Arianism rapidly evolved a Ditheism of great peril to the conscience. The Lord, notwithstanding the lifting of his humanity to the throne of universal judgment, and the lifting of his Sonship into the bosom of God, on more than one occasion reminds his hearers of the unity, the solity, of Almighty God.

They were snapping up worthless pretenders, and drinking the flattery of men rather than the approval of God.

The form of the conditional sentence shows that the protasis is a supposition of an event contrary to the fact. They were <span class="accented">not believing</span> Moses, though they were putting a vain and illusive confidence in him; and hence they were not believing in Christ.

The old saying contains Christ's utterance: <span class="accented">Novum Testamentum in Vetere latet, Vetus Testamentum in Novo patet.</span> Reference is made to the great place which Moses gave to the first promise, to the typical deliverances of a fallen world, to the hopes of a redeeming Seed. Christ referred to the Mosaic type involved in the spirit willing to sacrifice the Only Begotten, to the creation of the birthright blessing, the visions of the dying Israel, to the blessings on Judah; to the significance of the Law, of the tabernacle, of the Passover, of the Day of Atonement, of prophet, priest, and king, and the very special prophecy concerning a Prophet like unto himself. More than this, Moses had set forth in the Decalogue the portrait sketch of the perfect Man, of the Divine life which the Lord Jesus proceeded to fill out, to fulfil. He awakened by the Law that sense of sin and sinfulness which the Lord Christ had come to soothe and obliterate. but if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? "They are easier for you to understand; you have them ever on your tongue. If their meaning is missed, the deeper truths of my words will be more inaccessible to you." The antithesis is rather between the "his" and "my" than between the "writings" and "words." "This charge of not believing Moses, addressed to people who were put in a fury by the pretended violation of one of the Mosaic commandments, recalls other words of Jesus (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29-32</a>), '<span class="accented">Ye build the tombs of the prophets, wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are children of them that killed the prophets</span>" (Godet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Chronological difficulties beset our  treatment of this miraculous narrative with its varied consequences and results. Many curious and even violent measures have been resorted to with a view to solve them. Some have supposed that ch. 5. and 6. have been inverted in order, and that thus the presence of our Lord in Galilee, mentioned in ch. 4, would account for the statement of ch. 6:1 and the journey to Jerusalem of ch. 5:1, be brought into closer relation with ch. 7. We cannot see the faintest indication or evidence whatever of any such treatment of the Gospel by the authors of the manuscripts or the quotations or versions. The evangelist has just completed his record of the conflict between Jesus and the recognized leaders of the people in Jerusalem. He had introduced our Lord's own vindication (based on the highest grounds) of his own right to deal with the rabbinical restrictions upon sabbath duty. These grounds were the eternal relations of his own inner nature and consciousness with the Father's. On no occasion had Christ made the uniqueness of his personal claims and powers more explicit. He called for entire obedience to his word as the condition of eternal life, and as the key to the Scriptures of God. If we had no synoptic tradition to give a closer historical setting of the narrative which here follows, we might take Meyer's view, and say that the "after these things" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) of ver. 1 referred to the discourse of the previous chapter, and that the "departed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) referred to Jerusalem as its starting point; and, notwithstanding the extreme awkwardness of the expression, we might have supposed that "the other side" of the sea was the other side of it from Jerusalem (cf. <a href="../../par/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). Some commentators appear to have a morbid fear of reducing a difficulty, or seeing a harmony, between these four narratives. One thing is dear, that they are independent of one another, are not derived from each other, do each involve side views of the event distinct from the rest, and yet concur in the same general representation. The synoptists, however, place the "feeding of the multitudes" in the midst of a group of most remarkable and varied events. It is for them one page out of many descriptive of the Galilaean ministry, and which ultimately led to grievous departure from and diminution of the temporary popularity of the great Prophet. It would seem that bitter hostility, as well as excited enthusiasm, was checkering his early ministry. The synoptics take pains to show the combined effect of his self-revelations <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on his own fellow townsmen (<a href="../../par/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> upon his own family (<a href="../../par/mark/3-19.htm">Mark 3:19-21, 31-35</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> upon the populace (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-31.htm">Matthew 15:31</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> upon Herod Antipas (<a href="../../par/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14-16</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> upon the twelve disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-28</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> upon John the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> upon the Father in heaven (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-13</a> and parallel passages). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The canvas is crowded with scenes, the signs and wonders of healing and teaching are abundant. The blind see, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the daemons are exorcised. The twelve apostles are chosen the sermon on the mount is delivered, the twelve are sent forth in every direction with the proclamation of the coming of the kingdom and with the call to repentance, and an excitement produced by the mission of the twelve had proved to be extensive. The crowds throng him; they have no time even to eat bread. And we judge from <a href="../../par/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10</a> that this very excitement, amounting to feverish self-glorification on their part, appears to have been one at least of our Lord's motives for the temporary withdrawal of his disciples from the multitudes. Another event of singular significance contributed to the same result. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-12.htm">Matthew 14:12</a>) takes the opportunity of describing the tragic close of John's imprisonment, and relates how John's "disciples came to tell Jesus" of the bloody deed. A sudden panic was felt by the multitude. A crisis had arrived. The great Prophet must avenge his forerunner's death or lose his hold upon the affections of the fickle mass. The people appeared to the eyes of Jesus (<a href="../../par/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>) "as sheep without a shepherd." He had compassion on them, but he must make them understand the nature of the royalty as well as of the realm of the Messianic King. The true grounds for Christ's retirement are not incompatible, but mutually explanatory. The death of the renowned forerunner, of the idol of the multitude brought vividly to the mind of the Lord his own death - the  foreseen sacrifice of himself. The conviction that he must give himself to a violent death - give his flesh to the hungry and starving multitude, made the decadence of his popularity in Galilee a certain consequence of any right apprehension of his mission or claims. This mastery over the powers of nature which his compassion for others prevailed on him to manifest would be misunderstood. The moral and mystic meaning of it was far more important than the superficial inferences drawn by the Galilaeans. The real lesson of the miracle would grievously offend them. But it sank deeply into the apostolic mind, and hence the various aspects which it presents in the fourfold narrative. John selects this one specimen of the Galilaean ministry on account of its typical character, and records the high and wonderful results which the Lord educed from this high and striking manifestation of his power. There is, moreover, remarkable correspondence between the fifth and sixth chapters in this respect, that Galilee, like Jerusalem, recoils from the highest claims of Jesus, and developed an antagonism or an indifference as deadly if not as malignant as that which has displayed itself in the metropolis. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> (see note on John 5:1; not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which would mean after this particular scene in Jerusalem) - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. after a group of events, one of which may have been this visit to the metropolis, but which included also the early Galilaean ministry as presented in the synoptic narrative, and with which John and his readers were familiar - Jesus departed from the side of the sea on which he was, and as we may judge (ver. 24) from Capernaum, now known to be his chief resting place, most probably the home of his mother, brothers, and nearest friends, <span class="cmt_word">to the other side of the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias</span>; or, <span class="accented">of the Galilaean sea of Tiberias</span>. It does not follow that the evangelist had the southernmost portion of the lake in his mind (as Meyer suggests). Tiberius was the showy city built by Herod Antipas on the western shore of the lake. Herod called the place after the name of Tiberius Caesar, and conferred upon it many Gentile characteristics. From the time of Antipas to that of Agrippa it was the chief town of the tetrarchy. After the destruction of Jerusalem it became for centuries the site era celebrated school of Hebrew learning, and one of the sacred cities of the Jews. Jewish tradition makes it the scene of the last judgment and the resurrection of the dead. It was a modern city, which may account for the omission of its name in the synoptic narrative. Christ never visited it that we know cf. He preferred the fishing village of Bethsaida, or the more thoroughly Hebrew aspect of Capernaum. Nevertheless, "Tiberias" gave to Gentile cars the best and least dubious designation of the lake. So Pausanias (5, 7, 3) calls it the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> ("the lake Tiber"). Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a>) calls it the "Lake Gennesaret<span class="accented"></span>," and Matthew and Mark "the Sea of Galilee" without any other epithet. John (<a href="../../par/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a>) calls it "the Sea of Tiberias." This multiplicity of lake names, due in the first instance to some peculiarity of the including shores, finds easy parallels in Derwentwater and Keswick Lake, and in the "Lake of the Four Cantons," called also" Lake of Luzern," etc. Christ sought retirement from the surging crowd, and for himself and his excited disciples a time of rest and communion with the Father, who had accepted, as part of his Divine plan, the awful sacrifice of the life of John the Baptist. He went "by ship," says Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>) to a desert place. In Luke's account this solitary place was towards or near (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) a city called "Bethsaida." It is difficult to believe that this is the familiar Bethsaida or "fishing town," situated a little south of Capernaum, because we are met in the account of Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>) with the statement that, after the miracle, the disciples were urged to go to the other side of the lake (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>) towards Bethsaida. This, compared with ver. 17, is obviously in the same direction as Capernaum. Indeed, the term, "Bethsaida of Galilee," referred to in ch. 12:21 (as the Apostle Philip's residence), seems used with the view of distinguishing it from some other place of the same name. Now, Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02, 1) mentions a <span class="accented">Bethsaida Julias</span> situated on the northeastern extremity of the lake. The "ruins of this city may be still seen on the rising hilly ground which here retires somewhat from the river and the lake. It was situated in <span class="accented">Gaulonitis</span>, in the tetrarchy of Philip, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of Herod, yet not far from the road into Peraea by which the Galilaean pilgrims to the metropolis might be expected to travel. The silence of these hills provided the opportunity of retirement. But it was frustrated by the eager excitement of the multitude.

Their "following" had not been by ship, but round the head of the lake, and across the ford of the Jordan, which is still situated about two miles from the point where the river flows into the Sea of Galilee. The multitudes would easily learn the direction of the well known boat with its solitary sail, and would be, some of them, ready at the landing place, to greet the Lord on his arrival. Many hours might elapse before the crowd had reached such vast proportions as we subsequently find. It may easily have been swollen by curious and inquisitive pilgrims, or by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, intent on a sight of the Prophet who had preached the sermon, who had spoken in wondrous parables, who had given such striking proof that "God was with him."

This last passage is an interesting confirmation of our text. The usage implies on the part of the four evangelists familiar acquaintance with the scenery. <span class="cmt_word">And there he sat</span> <span class="cmt_word">down</span> <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">his disciples</span>. From this elevation they would see the gathering multitudes streaming from different points and meeting on the pebbly beach, asking each other where was the Master? and whither had the Prophet, the Healer, fled? Women and little children are in the crowd (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>). Weiss, who argues that the main features of the narrative are deeply imbedded in all the traditions, summarily disposes of the later accounts of the similar event recited by Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/8-1.htm">Mark 8:1-11</a>) and Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32-38</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</span> The ordinary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> need not be departed from (cf. <a href="../../par/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>). This valuable note of time is confirmed by another hint incidentally dropped. A month later than the Passover it could not be said that "much grass" was in the place. In the late spring such a phrase would most inadequately represent the scene that was indelibly impressed on the fourfold tradition. Whatever the unnamed feast was (<a href="../../par/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>), whether Trumpets, Purim, or Passover, we have reached the month Abib, when the crowds of pilgrims were gathering for their southern journey. If the Purim were the unnamed feast, then the suggestion arises that Christ's reception at Jerusalem had prevented his remaining until the Passover of that year. If the Passover be meant (<a href="../../par/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>), then a year has passed between ch. 5. and 6. Nor is this a day too long for the crowd of events and teachings recorded by the synoptists as having taken place before the death of John. The note of time may be recorded as implying the dominant sentiment in the minds of the people. The great deliverance from Egyptian bondage was burned into the national conscience, and the fanatic desire for a second Moses to lead them out of Roman servitude was at such seasons fanned into a flame. The Lord had his own thought about the Paschal lamb, and knew that God was preparing a Lamb for sacrifice. In mystic, parabolic sense he foreknew that men would and must consume the flesh of this sacrifice. He was ready, moreover, to show them that he could supply all their need. The great Prophet who had said of himself, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" had just fallen beneath the executioner's axe. The people were bereft of a great prophet and leader, and to Christ's eye they were "as sheep without a shepherd." Verily he was preparing to lay down his life as a good Shepherd for these sheep - to provide for them in the future a feast of living bread. All this may rationally be admitted, without for a moment conceding that second-century <span class="accented">ideas</span> like these were the formative causes of the narrative. The miracle that follows stands on an entirely distinct basis, and is more powerfully attested than any ether miracle, except the resurrection of Christ. If it stood in John's record alone, there might be some colour for the supposition that we have merely a parable of great beauty. But the threefold tradition long anterior to John's Gospel deprives even the pseudo-John of the possibility of inventing it. On the other hand, the appearance of the narrative in John's Gospel deprives it of the <span class="accented">mythical</span> character which some have attributed to the authors of the synoptic Gospels. Thoma, in the spirit of Strauss, here imagines that the synoptists were busy in fashioning a miracle of sustenance and a portent upon the waters - a sign on land and sea - to correspond with the manna and Red Sea marvels of the Book of Exodus. "The  mountain" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is, as he thinks, a similitude of the Mount Sinai, and, as the latter represented the giving of the Law, this was associated with the mountain of Beatitudes. He goes further, and sees in the Johannine narrative the Christian (<span class="accented">agapae</span>) feasts, and the deliverance of the Apostle Paul from shipwreck! He is even more ingenious still, and suggests that the "five thousand" fed at the first miraculous meal, with twelve baskets of fragments, correspond with the results of the first preaching of the twelve apostles, and that the seven loaves among the four thousand reflect "the many hundreds" who were benefited by the seven evangelists. He endeavours by a most elaborate process to make it appear that John has here combined into one tableau minute traces derived from the five several accounts of the two miracles. The old rationalistic theory was that the miracle was only an exaggerated poetical statement of the fact; that a good example of charity on the part of the apostles was followed by others, and so food was found for the entire multitude. This hypothesis breaks on the rock that the authors of these Gospels intended to convey a perfectly different idea. The effect of such cheap philanthropy and pragmatic travesty of a royal act would not have been that the multitudes would have rushed to the conclusion that he had done a kingly deed, or one in the least way calculated to suggest the notion that he could feed armies at his will. All efforts to extirpate by such theories the supernatural character of the occurrence fail, and force the reader back upon the plain statements of the fourfold narrative.

The first approach of the multitude was the occasion of a suggestion which Jesus made to Philip. The other evangelists record the reopening of the conversation on the same theme, stimulated by the question already put to Philip in the forenoon, and on this occasion originated by the disciples. The company arrived by the head of the lake (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/6-33.htm">Mark 6:33</a>, "They ran afoot out of all the cities"); and the first compassionate thought is attributed by John to the Lord himself: <span class="cmt_word">Whence are we to</span> <span class="cmt_word">buy</span> (bread) <span class="cmt_word">loaves, that these multitudes may eat?</span> This very question shows the intimate relations between our Lord and his disciples - the touch of nature. The identification of his interests with theirs is in the "we." Why should Philip be selected for the questioning or suggestion? Luthardt argues that it was a part of the needed education of that apostle that he should have been submitted to the searching anxiety. It is indeed added - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-6.htm">John 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This he said to test him;</span> but it is doubtful whether more is involved than an endeavour to entice from Philip the answer of faith, such <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, as "Lord, all things are possible to thee." Philip of Bethsaida was, moreover, in all probability, present at the wedding feast at Cans, and might have anticipated some such sign of the resources of his Lord. The other hints of Philip's character are severally consistent with this. Philip had said in the first instance to Nathanael, "Come and see." "Seeing is believing;" and Philip, on the night of the Passion, after much hearing and seeing of Jesus, said, "Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;" for he had even then not risen to the loftiness of the perception that the Father had been and was being revealed in Christ's own life (ch. 14.). Philip's personal acquaintance with the immediate vicinity is more likely to be the reason of his being put to this proof; while the tact of the inquiry as addressed to him is an undesigned note of the identity of the Johannine Christ with that portrayed by the synoptists. Bengel's suggestion, that Philip was entrusted with the commissariat of the twelve, is hardly consistent with the fact that Judas kept the common purse. We are expressly told that Jesus did not put the question in consequence of any deficiency of knowledge or resources on his own part, but to test the character and tone of Philip's mind. <span class="cmt_word">He himself knew what he was about to do.</span> Thus, by a slight touch, we see the blending of the distinctly human with the consciously Divine elements of that unique personality of his. There were to his Divine consciousness no gaps of reality, but he so threw himself into human conditions that he could ask the question and pass through the experience of a man. The whole <span class="accented">kenotic</span> controversy is, of course, involved in the solution of the problem offered  by this verse. Perhaps no greater difficulty is involved in imagining the union of the Divine and human in one personality, in which at times the Ego is the Son of God and at other times purely the Son of man, than there is in the blending of the flesh and spirit in the Divine life of our own experience. John saw this, felt this, when the question was addressed to Philip. He saw by intuitive glance, as on so many other occasions, what Christ "knew" absolutely (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) or came to know by experience and observation (<a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-19.htm">John 16:19</a>). The "trial," not the "temptation," of Philip was obvious in the form and tone of the question. The use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> shows that it frequently means "test," "prove," as well as "tempt." If God tempts, it is with the beneficent intention of encouraging the tempted one to succeed, to resist the allurement, to show and prove his power to bear a more serious assault. If the devil tempts (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), it is with the hope of inducing the sufferer to yield and fail. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Philip took a calculating method of meeting the difficulty, and looked at the question as one which their entire resources were unable to solve. He did not so much as think of the "whence," or from what quarter the loaves could be procured, as how much money would be required to meet the ease. <span class="cmt_word">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of loaves are not sufficient for them, that each</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> <span class="cmt_word">may</span> <span class="cmt_word">take a little.</span> The <span class="accented">denarius</span> was equal to about eightpence halfpenny of our money; so that the sum spoken of, probably representing the entire contents of their common purse, was only six pounds fifteen shillings, and was utterly insufficient for the purpose. The conversation preserved by Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/6-35.htm">Mark 6:35-37</a>) cannot well be made part of this language of Philip, but rather follows when the short afternoon was coming on, and the long shadows indicated the near approach of darkness. Philip had told the other disciples of the Lord's question, and they had discussed the possible perils of the case and the intentions of the Lord. It is interesting to see, in Mark, that the same sum was mentioned as being insufficient for the needs of the great multitudes. John has not only abridged the narrative of the synoptists, but added a feature which is of interest, and shows how for some hours the disciples had meditated on what they fancied would be necessary, and had come to the somewhat unwelcome conclusion that they must sacrifice their entire stock of funds. The Lord had first of all made the suggestion. They now go to him, to beseech his influence to send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and <span class="accented">buy themselves something to eat</span>. When the enigmatic words burst from his lips, "Give ye them to eat," the two hundred pennyworth of bread is once more referred to by the disciples as insufficient (<a href="../../par/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15-17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then saith one of his disciples to him, viz.

On other occasions Andrew is singled out as the brother of Simon and friend of Philip (<a href="../../par/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a>). This repeated reference to the illustrious brother of Simon is a refutation of the ill-natured charge against the author of the Gospel, that he aimed at the depreciation of the character of the great apostle. Moreover, it is interesting to remember that in the <span class="accented">Muratorian</span> fragment on the Canon, "Andrew" is specially mentioned as being one of those present with John in Ephesus, who urged him to write his Gospel (see Introduction, IV. 2 (3)). <span class="cmt_word">There is</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">lad</span> <span class="cmt_word">here</span> (possibly a lad who was brought with themselves, or who had attached himself to the twelve) <span class="cmt_word">who has five barley loaves</span>, the bread of the poorest classes. Of this there is ample proof ('Sotah,' 2:1, quoted by Edersheim, vol. 1:681): "While all other meat offerings were of wheat, that brought by the woman accused of adultery was to be of <span class="accented">barley</span>, because, as her deed is that of the animals, so her offering is of the food of animals." If this lad was conveying the food stock of the Lord and his apostles, it is an impressive but accidental hint that "for our sakes he became poor," and classed himself socially with the humblest. <span class="cmt_word">And two fishes</span>. The use of this word is peculiar to our Gospel (Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>; Mark, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the ordinary word for "fish; "but John uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the diminutive of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which means "savoury," eaten with bread). This opsarion mostly consisted of small fishes caught in the lake, which were dried, salted as "sardines" or "anchovies" are with ourselves for a similar purpose. This habit belonged locally to the neighbourhood of the lake, and reveals the Galilman origin or associations of the writer. The Aramaic word, <span class="accented">ophsonim</span>, is derived from the Greek <span class="accented">opson</span>, and that of <span class="accented">aphjain</span>, or <span class="accented">aphiz</span>, is the name for a small fish caught in the lake, the drying of which was a lucrative source of industry.  Edersheim reminds us that the fish laid on the charcoal fire (<a href="../../par/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9, 10, 13</a>) was "<span class="accented">opsarion</span>," and that of this the risen Lord, on the shore of this very lake, gave to his disciples to eat, though he guided them at that time to a shoal of <span class="accented">great fishes</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and bade them add some of these to the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which he was content to use still. The use of this word on these two occasions shows that, at the last, our Lord reminds his disciples of the miraculous feeding by the shore of the lake; and both narratives breathe the air of the northern parts of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">But what are these among so many?</span> The same lesson of the insufficiency of human resources to meet great human needs is suggested by <a href="../../par/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21-23</a>. Our resources at the very best are quite exhausted. Our best, our all, avails little - an expression which would apply to the numberless offers of our poor humanity and of our limited faculties to meet the moral starvation of the world. Take the Old Testament: how can the dispensation of all its provision satisfy <span class="accented">per se</span> the need of mankind as a whole? Greek philosophy, even if it satisfy the few, the leisurely, the cynical, the learned, the wise men of the West, what will it do for the poor, the broken hearted, the consciously guilty? The good things of this life are equally powerless, and the proposals of even truth itself, apart from the gracious operations of the Spirit, would fail to meet the wants or necessities of the unbelieving.

The image of the garden plots, with different divisions between them, forced itself on the eyewitness (see Trench, "Miracles," p. 205).

This is not incompatible with the language of the synoptists, that he gave to the disciples, they to the multitude, an undoubted allegory of the method in which all his greatest gifts have been diffused over the world; but John calls special attention to the part, the supreme part, taken in this proceeding by the Lord himself. Advantage has been taken of this to show that the narrative is a glorification of the Eucharistial meal, at which Jesus gave to his disciples the bread which he brake. <span class="cmt_word">Likewise also of the fishes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">as much as they wished.</span> This is, doubtless, the place or moment when the mighty miracle occurred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Twas seed-time when he blessed the bread,<br />Twas harvest when he brake."</span> This pretty couplet, with Augmstine's and Olshausen's remarks that the processes of nature were hastened by the great organ of the Divine Creator, does not throw any light upon the phenomenon. It makes it more  inexplicable, for ground corn and baked barley loaves afford no parallel with living seeds, and dead and salted fish create even greater difficulties. "Frugality exaggerated into a miracle" (Renan) is far more thinkable, though it leaves the sequel unexplained. We must either reject the narrative, notwithstanding its wonderful confirmation by two or three separate eyewitnesses, or we must accept it. If we do the latter, we see in this (and the following) miracle an assertion that the creative will of Christ is the sole cause of the additional food that was provided for the sustenance of this multitude. The Son of God added to the sum of things, to the quantity of matter, or called together from surrounding air the elements needed for the purpose, just as in hushing the storm he met force by that will of his which is the ultimate source and ground of all force. He spake in the power of Heaven, and it was done. <span class="accented">He gave thanks, and he distributed</span>.

This sacred economy of Jesus is in harmony with and illustrative of the ways of the Creator with his universe, and of the wisdom recommended to his disciples. The other evangelists describe the facts, but do not attribute the order to the wise words of the Lord himself. Paulus, in the endeavour to make this statement confirm his rationalistic interpretation, makes sad havoc of the grammar, and, instead of translating -

The number "twelve" naturally suggests that each one of the twelve apostles had been employed in the collection of the fragments. There is no need, with Luthardt, to imagine an unconscious reference to the twelve tribes of Israel, further than that the twelve apostles themselves were at first chosen with that reference. The number twelve points to the fact that the apostles had already been selected, though this Gospel is silent about that fact. Again, the word used for "basket" is that which is used in the three synoptic narratives, and contrasts with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the word used in the later account of the feeding of the four thousand. It means the ordinary wallet, or <span class="accented">corbis</span>, in which Jews, on the march, were accustomed to carry their food. In <a href="../../par/matthew/16-8.htm">Matthew 16:8-12</a>, where the two miracles are compared with each other, the two words are again used. The "fragments," the superabundance of provision of love for all mankind, was an idea specially conveyed by our Lord as antithetic to the monopolizing doctrine of the scribes and Pharisees. It is unsatisfactory to suppose that the author of this Gospel manipulated the story as given in Mark, adapting it to his own purpose. John's narrative is full of fresh life, though not so pictorial as that of the Second Gospel. The incident of Philip and Andrew is calculated to throw much light upon the event without conflicting with the synoptists. The mythical hypothesis suggests that we have here a Messianic reproduction of the story of Elijah and the cruse of oil (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-16.htm">1 Kings 17:16</a>), or the augmentation of the oil by Elisha (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1-7</a>), and still more the feeding by Elisha of a hundred men with twenty loaves of bread and fresh ears of corn (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a>). The suggestion simply shows that there were anticipations in the prophetic career of the great prophets of the northern kingdom of that which the greater than Elijah. accomplished in vindication of his own mission. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>, <span class="cmt_word">when they saw the sign which he</span> <span class="cmt_word">wrought</span> - when they witnessed the marvel, admitted that it was a testimony to what was special and authoritative in the great Healer and Life-giver, a "sign" of his higher nature - <span class="cmt_word">said, This is</span> <span class="cmt_word">verily the Prophet that is coming into the world.</span> This was probably in reference to the great prediction (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>) to which such frequent and solemn reference was made. From <a href="../../par/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21, 25</a>,  we learn that the Sanhedrists distinguished between "the Christ," "the Elijah," and "that Prophet;" but these verses show how the two ideas were blended in the minds of the people. As Jesus fulfilled one or more of the predictions of the Old Testament, and embodied the foreshadowings of his entire career which were given in the temple and the sabbath, in the ritual and the priest, in the prophet and the king, it was gradually revealed to the world that in him all fulness dwelt. At all events, just as in the case of Nathanael, the prophetic gifts of Jesus suggested to the guileless man that he was King of Israel, so here we find a similar connection of ideas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore knowing</span> (having found, perceived (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>), by ominous movements in the crowd, or in any other way still more explicit) <span class="cmt_word">that they were about to come and</span> by violence, or force, <span class="cmt_word">seize him in order that they might make him King.</span> This movement was not an unnatural one. They were on the way to Jerusalem, and they were thirsting to throw off the yoke of Rome and of Herod, and probably indignant to the extreme with the "deep damnation" of John the Baptist's death. In such a frame, the display of power and resources which they had just witnessed pointed Jesus out as their popular idol, and encouraged the belief, which did not die out till it was quenched in blood. The bald suggestion would clash absolutely with the Lord's own plan, with the Father's design concerning him. It would seem that the disciples manifested great reluctance to leave Christ or the crowd; for both Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22</a>) and Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>) imply that Jesus had to use special means to induce them to depart (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He compelled them to do so. If we had nothing but the synoptic narrative to guide us, we might suppose that Jesus had difficulty in resisting the desire of the disciples to remain always at his side; or that the intensity of their affection was interfering too much with the need in which he felt of retirement and solitude. John's statement here illumines the language of the other Gospels. The disciples themselves were strongly moved by the passions of the thousands; they were sharing in the general enthusiasm. To quench such an unholy or unspiritual view of the true Prophet and King, the disciples must be separated from the crowd, and Christ had to overcome by some special utterance of his authority the reluctance of the twelve to embark in their ship. Having done this, and without their help, he sent the multitudes away. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">withdrew</span>, <span class="cmt_word">for the second time, to the mountain</span> (cf. ver. 3), and this time <span class="cmt_word">himself alone.</span> These occasional separations from the apostles were undoubtedly part of the discipline to which they were subjected. They were taught that, when he was no longer visible to them, he might still be spiritually present and able to succour them.

The first evening (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) lasted from three to six p.m., the "second evening" stretched from sundown to darkness (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>).

This occasions no difficulty to those who remember that there were two Bethsaidas - one, "Bethsaida <span class="accented">Julias</span>," on the northeastern end of the lake; and the other near to Capernaum, called "Bethsaida <span class="accented">of Galilee</span>." The two towns were so near that the latter Bethsaida might reasonably he regarded as the port of Capernaum. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-17.htm">John 6:17</a></div><div class="verse">And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.

This thrilling touch in John's narrative makes it more than evident that the beloved disciple was on board. He had been expecting the Master to make his appearance in some form. He had looked long and eagerly to that point on the mountainside whither he knew that Jesus had retired. The dreary and disappointed expectation, the long and weary waiting, left an indelible impression. Their natural course towards Capernaum would have been almost parallel with the shore of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> lake; but it was dark and tempestuous, they could not steer. <span class="cmt_word">And the sea was being roused</span> from its slumber <span class="cmt_word">by reason of a high wind which was blowing.</span> If the wind came from the north, it would drift  them out into the darkness and the middle of the lake, which is there, at its widest, about five miles broad, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. forty stadia, or furlongs. The statement of the next verse comes then into undesigned coincidence with <a href="../../par/mark/6-47.htm">Mark 6:47</a>, which shows that they were "in the midst of the sea," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. halfway from shore to shore. This would exactly correspond with the following statement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-18.htm">John 6:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a></div><div class="verse">So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they had</span> <span class="cmt_word">rowed</span> <span class="cmt_word">about</span> <span class="cmt_word">twenty-five or thirty stadia;</span> or, <span class="accented">furlongs</span>. When they had rowed with a northwest wind, one "contrary to them," about three miles and a half, they would be in the midst of the broadest portion of the lake, and exposed to the force of those gales which often sweep down with astonishing fury upon lakes similarly guarded on all sides by high hills. While the wind was tossing the little lake into angry waves, it was not silent on the mountain side or summit, and Jesus (says Mark) "saw them toiling in rowing." He loved them to the uttermost. Now, Jesus never went out of his way to work a miracle, but he never went out of his way to avoid one. It seems as natural to him to make his will the cause of events as to submit to the arbitrament of circumstances. The miracle, however, was always for the benefit of others, not for his own advantage and comfort. <span class="cmt_word">They beheld Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship</span>. Paulus, Gfrorer, and Baumgarten-Crusius suppose that Jesus was walking "along the shore" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is the phrase used for this movement in <a href="../../par/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16</a>; not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as here), and that they had miscalculated their distance, and that there was no manifestation of special power on the occasion, nothing less than one of the most ordinary of all coincidences. The three narrators, each in his own manner, convey a profoundly different impression. The discovery of their Lord thus in near proximity would not have made them "cry out for fear," and say (Matthew and Mark), "It is a phantasm," an apparition, a herald of immediate destruction. The loud cry (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) is the especial note of Mark. John simply says, <span class="cmt_word">They were affrighted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). They might have eagerly longed for his presence, remembering his recent display of power when "the winds and sea obeyed him." But when the deliverance came, the manner of it was unexpected, and the symbolism ineffably sublime. They could not have been ignorant of the Psalms which spoke of Jehovah walking on the sea, and mightier than its waves (see also <a href="../../par/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>, "He alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth on the heights of the sea"). This visible nearness to them of the mighty power of God is enough to have startled them into cries of fear; but it is quite incompatible with the rationalistic interpretation of the event. Matthew and Mark both relate that the Lord came to them at or about the fourth watch (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. between three and six a.m.), when the first gleams of light were breaking over the eastern hills. Consequently, their peril had been prolonged and perplexing. The whole of the narrative lends itself to symbol, and suggests the impressive analogy of the calamities to which the ship of God's Church has been exposed in its long history. Often has the Church been chastised for its secular tastes and worldly passions, buffeted with the storms of the world and tormented by the waves; but in the direst extremity it has seen the deliverer approach, and at first cried out for fear, trembling at his nearness. Individual believers have often seen, in this picture of the storm and the Saviour, an <span class="accented">image</span> of the sore travail and victory of their faith. The disposition on the part of numerous expositors to press these analogies has strengthened the hands of the critical and rationalistic expositors. We can grant that the idea which is so fertile is more important than the narrative <span class="accented">per se</span>, but apart from the historic fact itself, who can say that the idea would ever have dawned on human minds? We make no further attempt to think out the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> of the miracle, nor can we with that view accept the <span class="accented">docetic</span> conception of the body of Christ, which some have attributed most unfairly to John's Gospel. It is enough that the will of Christ thus faced the forces of nature, and prophesied the ultimate victory which the will of glorified humanity will likewise win. The great <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> of Christ include his power over nature, in its physical elements and forces, in the regions of both animal and vegetable life, over human nature, diseased, crippled, devil ridden, and dead. The highest realm over which he reigned was his own Divine-human Person, as recorded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">in this event,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in his transfiguration, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his resurrection and ascension.

The Church has ever since regarded them as veritably  sacramental. In the darkest hour of men and Churches, in the throes of persecution in the furnace of temptation, on a million death-beds, the same voice has been heard. tits Divine Personality, his infinite power and perfect sympathy, the conviction of his specialized regard and veritable nearness (as we count nearness), have scattered doubt and fear. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-21.htm">John 6:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they were willing to receive him into the ship: and straightway the ship was at the land whither they were going</span>. Some expositors, who find discrepancy between this statement and that of the synoptists, say, "they were willing, but did not do it," <span class="accented">because</span> the vessel is said by some remarkable process to have been miraculously propelled to the shore (so Lucke, Meyer). There are many passages, however, where a similar expression is used, and where no doubt arises that that which the actors were willing to do they actually did (see <a href="../../par/mark/12-38.htm">Mark 12:38</a>; certainly scribes were not only willing to, but actually did, wear long robes). Chrysostom felt this difficulty, and actually proposed to read <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which would remove the difficulty; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> veritably contains this reading, but it has every appearance of an unauthorized correction. The imperfect tense implies a lengthened willingness supervening on fear and outcry - a willingness or wish increased by the sound of his voice, following his first action, his apparent resolve to pass by them; and, still more, by the incident described in Matthew's Gospel, of Peter's desire to display the strength of his faith and the eminence of his position among the twelve. This occupied time, during which the wind may have been bearing them briskly in their true direction. They willed, wished, to take him into the ship, and did so, and the calm supervened as described in Matthew and Mark. Their wish is not frustrated by the fact now mentioned, but accompanied by it. "Straightway," etc. Most expositors confess this to be an additional miracle, that the twenty furlongs or thereabouts (two miles and a half) were suddenly traversed and miraculously abolished. There would be a greater miracle in this than in the two events which preceded. The annihilation of space and time is the obliteration of the very categories of thought, and would, if conveyed by the statement, suggest a <span class="accented">stupendous</span> and, so far as we can see, a useless portent. It would strongly tempt us to accept the rationalistic interpretation. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not always mean "instantaneously," but simply that the next thing to notice or observe was the fact described. Take <a href="../../par/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21, 29</a>. It does not mean that any miraculous rapidity characterized the movement of Christ to the house of Simon and Andrew (<a href="../../par/mark/4-17.htm">Mark 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a> 3John 14 <a href="../../par/john/13-32.htm">John 13:32</a>; and many other passages). The author of the "Christian Year" has consecrated in sweet lines the supposed addition to the miracle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thou Framer of the light and dark,<br />Steer through the tempest thine own ark;<br />Amid the howling wintry sea,<br />We are in port, if we have thee."</span> But there are so many ways in which this "straightway" may be reconciled with an ordinary disembarkation, that there is no necessity to regard it as implied in John's narrative. John so often leaves gaps unfilled in his chronology and horology that no peat emphasis need be laid upon the annihilation (save in his adoring thought) of the hour before the dawn.

The discussion does unquestionably alter its scope as it proceeds, and at vers. 41 and 52 "the Jews" take up a controversy which had previously been conducted by a portion of the crowd who witnessed his mighty works.

Before the evangelist proceeds to relate this great discourse, he portrays the historical platform, the audience to which it is addressed, and this in a sentence which is unusually involved and perplexed in its construction. The first clause with its verb, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is not completed until two or three parenthetical ideas are introduced; and then in ver. 24 the sentence is taken up or recom-menced, after which the main affirmation follows, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, etc. The whole sentence is intended to explain the regathering of the crowd on the seashore at Capernaum,  and that excited state of baulked curiosity with which they encountered the Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The next day, the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea,</span> near the site of the great miracle, amazed at the departure of the disciples and the separation between them and Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">and saw that there was only one little boat</span> <span class="cmt_word">there</span>  - or "none other little boat there save one," and this was too small for it to be the boat which brought Jesus and his disciples thither or took the latter away - and saw <span class="cmt_word">that Jesus did not enter with his disciples into the boat</span> in which they were accustomed to move about the lake, <span class="cmt_word">but that his disciples departed alone</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span>  <span class="cmt_word">there came boats from Tiberias,</span> the principal station on the lake, the boatmen hoping to secure numerous ferry freights, <span class="cmt_word">near to the place where they did eat bread after that the Lord had given thanks,</span> associating the marvellous gift with the holy thanksgiving of the wondrous Host). He does not say that Tiberias was near to the place where, etc., but that the boats from Tiberias came near to the place, etc. This parenthesis makes it clear that this one little boat was the only one belonging to the desert place, and could not have conveyed Jesus away. <span class="cmt_word">When then the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples</span> - the latter had gone and not returned, and Jesus could not be found on the mountain side or summit or hollows (not until we reach this statement does the writer give the principal verb of the sentence) - <span class="cmt_word">they themselves embarked in the little boats, and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus</span>. This does not mean that the entire multitude took shipping. Such an exaggeration, contrary to the nature of even the most extravagant legend, some (Strauss) have tried to foist into the story for the sake of discrediting it. The geographical relation of the two places shows that there were other ways of passing from one spot to the other than by ship. That some should return by the head of the lake, and others should cross its northern are by boat to Capernaum, reveals a simple and interesting fact, which is incidentally conveyed by the synoptists, viz. that Capernaum was the customary dwelling place of our Lord during his Galilaean ministry (cf. <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a>; and see also <a href="../../par/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>).

The first group of healings drew some of you to my side, not for my word, but for more healing; and though some others of you who ate off the bread said (ver. 14), "This is the promised Prophet that is coming into the world," you did not get beyond the outward seeming, the superficial phenomenon, you revealed by thus rushing to the couclusion that I was your Prophet and King, that you did not really discern the sign I gave, and ye are seeking me now, not because you have really seen "signs" - <span class="cmt_word">but</span> <span class="cmt_word">because ye ate of the</span> (those) <span class="cmt_word">loaves, and were filled up</span> by this temporary supply of your daily want, expecting today some new, some more impressive, characteristic of the Messianic kingdom than yesterday.

Christ did not mean that these multitudes were not to toil for their daily bread, which could only be secured for them by labour and the sweat of the brow; <span class="cmt_word">but to labour for the food which endureth</span> (or, <span class="accented">abideth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto eternal life</span> (this last clause Moulton would separate from the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and considers to relate to the principal verb of the sentence; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "labour for the abiding food," <span class="accented">with a view to, or unto, eternal life</span>). The bread that abideth unto eternal life, however, corresponds very closely with the water of life (<a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), which, when once appropriated, flows and springs up with perennial energy within the soul, conferring the consciousness and the beginning of eternal life. There is a food which is imperishable and incorruptible, feeding the heavenly life within the soul, and which, if once assimilated, becomes Divine life itself. Labour for that life <span class="cmt_word">which the Son of man will give to you</span>. This grand idea, viz. the gift of eternal life in and by Christ himself, was one of the main themes of the Gospel of John. Christ knew himself to be the Giver of eternal life - a life of perfect blessedness, irrespective of time, and sense, and flesh, and the world, and death. The Lord here calls himself "Son of man," rather than "Son of God." The whole of the subsequent discourse expands and rests upon this gift of the perfect and blessed life in and by his <span class="accented">humanity</span>. In the previous chapter attention was called to the Divine Sonship and the Divine activity. Here equal emphasis was laid upon the <span class="accented">human</span> sonship and on the acceptance and assimilation by man of this supreme gift. The power or function of the Son of man to bestow this life is sustained by the assertion, <span class="cmt_word">For him</span> (this very one) <span class="cmt_word">the Father, even God, hath sealed.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>  (see <a href="../../par/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>)means here to ratify and accredit as worthy and competent to discharge such duties, to render indubitable, to confirm by outward visible sign. or seal, as one empowered to do so Divine a thing. The Father has made "the Son of man" the steward of his bounty. The Son of man has the key to this boundless treasure, this eternal blessing. Men, however, must labour to receive so great a gift. It will prove to be a gift, even if they put forth the most strenuous energy to receive it. This first dialogue contrasts the carnal and spiritual reasons for seeking Jesus, and brings into sharp relief the Galilaean conception of the Christ, as Miracle worker, temporal Potentate, prophetic Leader of some vast host of triumphant enthusiasts, and contrasts with it the Lord's own conception. of himself as the Giver, the Medium, the divinely appointed Almoner of a spiritual blessing, for which, while the Father-God freely and lavishly gives it, the sons of men must eagerly toil. The next question and answer bring out the moral condition on which alone the gift can be dispensed.

There is a breadth about the question that may cover the ground involved in Christ's declaration, but it reveals, at the same time, the self-complacency, the carnal conception on the part of these Galilaeans of their being able, competent, to fulfil along certain lines to be specified, all the required conditions. But we must not be too hard on these Galilaeans, brought up as they were to believe in the efficacy of certain rounds of specific and arbitrary duties, methods of purification, forms of service and of abstinence, pilgrimages and fastings and feastings, as well as obedience to a specific moral code. They ask quite rationally, "What must we do?" and in various forms the same question bursts from the heart of all who have, starting from utter indifference, made any progress towards, or in the direction of, holy living or of Divine pleasing.

There is "one work" which God would have man do. Jesus admits that there is something to do (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) - there is a labour, an effort of the will needed to do what God requires; and this is evident enough as soon as this great work is described, viz. <span class="cmt_word">That ye believe on him whom he</span> (the Father) <span class="cmt_word">sent</span>; or, <span class="accented">hath sent</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, here preferred by the R.T. to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (see <a href="../../par/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>), marks the simple fact and continuous act of believing with the effort tending to such result; while the aorist would have pointed to one definite act of faith (see Westcott).. To "believe on him," to habitually entrust one's self to the power and grace of Christ, to make a full moral surrender of the soul to the Lord, includes in itself all other work, and is in itself the great work of God. "It is the Christian answer to the Jewish question" (Thoma). "Faith is the life of works, works the necessity of faith" (Westcott). "Faith is the highest kind of work, for by it man gives himself to God, and a free being can do nothing greater than give himself: St. James opposes work to a faith which would be nothing but intellectual belief. St. Paul opposes faith, active faith, to works of mere observance. The 'faith' of St. Paul is really the 'work' of St. James, according to this sovereign formula of Jesus, 'This is the work of God, that ye believe'" (Godet). Luther says, "To depend on God's Word, so that the heart is not terrified by sin and death, but trusts and believes in God, is a much severer and more difficult thing than the Carthusians or all orders of monks demand." Schleiermachcr says, "This is the most significant declaration, that all eternal life proceeds from nothing else than faith in Christ." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-30.htm">John 6:30</a></div><div class="verse">They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore to him</span>, <span class="cmt_word">What then doest thou as a sign that we may see and believe thee?</span> There is a kind of irony in the inquiry, "What doest <span class="accented">thou?"</span> There is at least some ironical mystification of the words of Jesus, "If we have not seen, as thou sayest, the sign, which we thought sufficient to induce us to hail thee as our Prophet-King, what sign wilt thou give us now? If we are to believe on thee, what sign art thou ready to show now that we may see it, and believe thee, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. take thy word as trustworthy, and so begin to consider whether it will be safe to believe in, to entrust ourselves to, thee?" It has been the peculiarity of the Jewish mind in all ages to seek after a sign, to desire some irresistible reason for invincible faith. In certain stages of immaturity and states of unrest we passionately ask for signs even now - for something more than silent words, for more than past memories, for some voice out of heaven, some gleams of glory, that "we may see and believe." These frames of mind are no whit more reprehensible than the Greek demand for unanswerable argument, for logical harmony, or for sure demonstration. They said to him, <span class="cmt_word">What dost thou work?</span> How wilt thou vindicate thy demand for such implicit trust? This very question has been made into a reason for breaking all historic connection between the miracle of the feeding and the dialogue and discourse before us (Grotius, Kuinoel, B. Bauer, Weisse, and Schenkel). It is, however, clear that they were still revolving the work of the past day, which Jesus had depreciated <span class="accented">per se</span>, and which, apart from the higher lesson it might have conveyed to them, and apart from the wrong conclusion they had been drawing from it, grievously perplexed them, and seemed insufficient to establish the new claim of Jesus. They, too, begin to depreciate it in comparison with a corresponding sign which Moses had wrought for their fathers. Verily if Moses had been the mediator of the portentous sign of the manna, if Moses had been its real anther, it was a much greater sign than what they witnessed at Bethsaida. For forty years the miraculous bread had been lavished upon them. Daily and weekly it proved its supernatural character. In quantity, quality, prolongation, and renewal day by day, and in its cessation when they ate the fresh corn of Canaan, they not unnaturally saw something immeasurably more vast and imposing than the offer of a single meal to a little company of five thousand men. Christ had wrought a <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but they had not seen the real <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> involved in it. He himself suggested that something entirely different from that meal, and different from their conclusions concerning it was the true "sign." Let him work the same adequate sign. They are not repudiating all knowledge of the feeding of the five thousand, nor revealing their ignorance of it. They are thrown back on their ingrained passion for supernatural proof, not as yet satisfied by what Christ had done.

The  manna (see <a href="../../par/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>.) appeared like the hoar frost out of heaven. It was gifted with numerous qualities - perishable if not immediately used, respecting in mysterious way the sabbath sanctity, attending the Israelites through their forty years" wandering, terminating when no longer wanted, utterly unlike, in quantity and quality, to what is the Oriental manna of commerce (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "Manna"). The psalmists spoke of it (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>) as virtually coming down out of heaven, as "corn of heaven," as "angels' food." The Targum of Jonathan, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>, says, "God caused bread to descend from heaven upon the sons of Israel," and a rabbinical commentary on Ecclesiastes, quoted by Lightfoot and Wettestein: "Redemptor prior descendere fecit pro iis manna; sic et Redemptor posterior descendere faciet manna." Consequently, they make the challenge, not as though Jesus had done no sign, but as though he had not done enough to put himself on an equality with Moses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said to them,</span> with the tones of special emphasis, Verily, verily, <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you, It was not Moses,</span> of whom you are reasonably thinking with due reverence, <span class="cmt_word">who</span> <span class="cmt_word">gave</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span> <span class="cmt_word">the bread out of heaven.</span> There are two assertions here.

There is a richer and more nourishing food than that, which alone deserves to be called Bread from heaven. The "corn of heaven," though God's gift, was not that of which I speak, nay, it was only the shadow and type of that. <span class="cmt_word">But my Father is giving you</span>, even now, <span class="cmt_word">the veritable bread out of heaven</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); that which fully answers the description of the term - food for your spiritual sustenance, bread which will save your souls alive, which, if assimilated by you, will convey the consciousness and reality of eternal blessedness. The kind of strength which will arise within you when once appropriated, is an eternal possession, an abiding advantage; the satisfaction is not exhausted by a short interval, it remains forever. The Son of man is entrusted with power to bestow it. He is sealed and sanctified and sent into the world for this purpose. This bread is veritably from heaven. Moses did not even give, nor was he the almoner even of, the manna. All the giving then was God's work, but he whom God has sent, on whom you have to believe, is a veritable Giver of this true bread from heaven.

(The latter is the view of Hengstenberg, Lange, Meyer, Westcott, Moulton; the former translation is partially urged by Godet, who thinks our Lord here spoke amphibologically, meaning both ideas, but by the form of the expression reserving the solution of the problem.) It certainly does not follow that, if he was speaking of himself, the expression <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> would have been used, because, in ver. 50, after he has removed all ambiguity, he still uses the present tense, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. The present tense is that of quality rather than of time. These characteristics of the veritable bread of God must hold good. It must have a heavenly origin, life-giving power, and universality of application to human need. <a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> is here repeated. The whole world is the object of the Divine grace and love. The bread of God must be a Divine gift, mysterious and heavenly in its origin, and must at once demonstrate its vitality, its Source, and its Giver. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-34.htm">John 6:34</a></div><div class="verse">Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said therefore to him, Lord!</span> His hearers have clearly been more impressed than ever with the extraordinary claims of the speaker. They have risen from the "Rabbi" of ver. 26 to "Kyrie," which implies, as the "Kyrie," or "Sir," or "Lord" of <a href="../../par/john/4-15.htm">John 4:15</a>, some advance in their tone of deference. The request that follows is neither ironical nor sarcastic, nor need it be as carnal in its spirit as the similar language of the woman of Samaria (<a href="../../par/john/4-15.htm">John 4:15</a>). They have some dim notion of "doing the works of God," and of some heavenly satisfaction given to their earthly wants. It may be that they imagine some material thing coming down out of heaven, more potent and lasting than the historic manna. <span class="cmt_word">Lord, evermore</span> - "at all times,"  "continuously" - <span class="cmt_word">give us this bread,</span> of which you speak, and which as Son of man you are able to bestow, which will not be limited in quantity, which will prove to be the elixir of life, the food of the eternal life, and which will satisfy all our hunger, abolish our poverty, make us indifferent to death. A great prayer this, which Christ showed himself not unwilling to answer in his own way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - [<span class="accented">But</span>, or <span class="accented">then</span>] <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to them,</span> now dropping all disguise, and gathering up into one burning word all the previous teaching, which they might have fathomed, but did not. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am the Bread of life;</span> or "that which cometh down out of heaven, the veritable life-eternal-giving Bread, which I, as the steward of the Divine bounty, am giving, is my very self, my Divine humanity." On other occasions the Lord said, "I am the Light of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), "I am the good Shepherd" (<a href="../../par/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>), "I am the Resurrection and the Life" (<a href="../../par/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>), "I am the veritable Vine" (<a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>). He claims here to be giving himself to the world, as the Source of its true life. The mode in which any human being can so assimilate this Bread that it should accomplish its purposes and transform itself into life, is by "coming" or "believing." The two terms are parallel, though in "craning" there is more emphasis laid on the distinct act of the will than in "believing." The process is very impressively conveyed. He who has started to come, <span class="cmt_word">he that is coming to me, shall by no means hunger; he that is believing on me -</span> endeavouring to effect such inward approval and surrender - <span class="cmt_word">shall never thirst</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> responds here to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). There is no special significance in the two-foldness of the parallel. "Coming" does not stand in any more immediate relation to "eating" than to "drinking," to the satisfaction of hunger than to that of thirst, nor does "believing" connote exclusively either the one or the other. The parallelism is a strengthening of the same idea. Approach to himself, believing surrender to the reality of his word, will satisfy the most pressing spiritual need, and do it in such a way that the hunger and thirst shall not, shall never, return. There is an invincible and unalterable assent produced by a real apprehension of Christ, which cannot be shaken out of the soul. Satisfaction of hunger may possibly (as Godet suggests) point to the supply of strength, and the appeasing of thirst to the supply of peace. The deeper idea is that the desire of the soul is satisfied, and it is not a recurrent desire. There are certain realities which, if once perceived, can never be unknown afterwards. There are consolations which, if once supplied, absolutely stanch and heal the wounds of the soul. Christ, in "coming down from heaven," by revealing the Divine Sonship in a Son of man. brings all heaven with him, opens all the Father's heart. To come to him and to believe on him is to feed on the corn of heaven and drink of that river of life, clear as crystal, which is ever issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.

Some difficulty has arisen from our not being able to find, in the previous dialogue, the exact words here quoted. Some have supposed it to refer to an unrecorded conversation (Alford, Westcott), or even to some written sentence which is now a lost fragment of the discourse. Meyer says (without answering the suggestions of Olshausen, Hengstenberg, Godet, and others), that there is no such statement in the context, and proposes to translate <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as he says it is not unfrequently found in Greek tragedians, as if it were equivalent to <span class="accented">dictum velim</span>) "I would have you told;" but there is no such usage in the New Testament, and <a href="../../par/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a> does not seem a parallel ease. It is not at all probable that Jesus was referring to the language of <a href="../../par/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>, words which were addressed to a different audience - to "Jews" at Jerusalem, and uttered many months before (Lucke and De Wette). But ver. 26 shows that Galilaeans had come to see him, and had come without belief in the great sign of his spiritual nature and claims which he had already granted. They had <span class="accented">seen</span> him and his great miracles, it is true; but they simply longed in consequence for "more bread" and "more healing," not for himself. In ver. 30 he draws from them a confession that they had not seen enough to believe him. This thought recurs not infrequently. "Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known <span class="accented">me, Philip?"</span> "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed" (<a href="../../par/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>). The setting forth of himself ought to have induced belief apart  even from works. He is so intensely conscious of the Divine reality himself, that he marvels at the unbelief of his hearers. Let them think as he does, and immediately the lifelong hunger and thirst of their souls would be satisfied. Seeing, however, is not believing in their ease; and he has already urged them to consider this lamentable spiritual blindness of theirs. The exclamation of this verse recites the obvious inference of the verses we have referred to, condenses into a sentence the spirit of what he had said, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>).

Vers. 39, 40 would seem to have been addressed more directly to the disciples, the less susceptible hearers retiring from him or engaging in eager conversation (cf. ver. 41). Nevertheless, the Lord takes up the continuous line of his self-revelation, and ver. 37 clearly refers the "non-coming" and "non-believing" in their case to their <span class="accented">moral</span> obliquity, and to the apparent inadequacy of sufficient proof to induce the faith which will satisfy spiritual hunger. This spiritual dulness on the part of all suggests some internal and necessary condition, which is, though yet absent, not said to be inaccessible. Seeing ought to issue in believing, but it does not; therefore there is something more than the manifestation of the Christ absolutely necessary. To that Jesus now reverts. <span class="accented">All</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, the neuter is also used of persons in <a href="../../par/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a> and John 17:2, used concerning the whole body of real believers, the whole mass of those who, when they see, do come - the entire company of believers regarded as a grand unity, and stretching out into the future) <span class="cmt_word">all that which the Father giveth me.</span> The subsequent descriptions of the Father's grace (vers. 44, 45) throw light on this. The "drawing of the Father," the "hearing and learning from the Father," are there declared to be conditions of "coming to Christ." All those influences on the soul, all the new-creating and spirit-quickening energies of the Holy Ghost, the new heart and tender conscience, the honest, serious desire for holy things, are broadly described in this passage as God's method and act of <span class="accented">giving</span> to the Son of his love. There is no necessity (with Augustine) to suppose that our Lord refers to an absolute predestinating decree. For if God has not yet given these particular men to him, it does not say that he will not and may nut do so yet. The Father's giving to the Son may indeed assume many forms. It may take the character of original constitution, of predisposition and temperamerit, or of special "providential education and training, or of tenderness of conscience, or of a truthful and sincere and unquenched desire. The Father is the Divine Cause. "The giving" implies a present activity of grace, not a foregone conclusion. <span class="cmt_word">All that which the Father giveth me shall reach me</span> - all souls touched by the Father in a thousand ways to the point of making a moral surrender to my claims, will reach me <span class="cmt_word">- and him that is coming to me</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. is on the way to me, is drawing near to me - I for my part will not cast out. Thus authority to refuse is claimed by Christ, and power to exclude from his fellowship and friendship, from his kingdom and glory. (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>). Admission is not the working of some impersonal law, but the individual response of him who has come down to give life. As far as man is concerned, it turns on his voluntary coming, on his bare willingness to be fed with heavenly food. It is impossible, so far as responsibility is concerned, to get back of personal wish and individual will. The process of genuine coming to Christ does show that the Father is therein giving such soul to his Son. Archdeacon Watkins says, "Men have now seized one and now the other of these truths, and have built upon them in separation logical systems of doctrine which are but half truths. He (Jesus) states them in union. Their reconciliation transcends human reason, but is within the experience of human life." The greatness of the self-consciousness of Christ appears in the further proof that he proceeds to supply of this relation to the Father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a></div><div class="verse">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I came down from heaven</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), <span class="cmt_word">not that I might do my own will, but the will of him that sent me</span> (see <a href="../../par/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 30</a>, notes). The practical, ethical force of this statement is to shape and defend the previous assurance. Christ's gracious reception and benediction is in willing harmony with, and not in opposition to, the Father's heart. There is no schism between the Father and Son. A separate will in and of itself assigned to the Son is not inconceivable, nay, it is imperatively necessary to posit, or we should lose all distinctions whatever between the Father and Son, between God and Christ. But the very separateness of the wills gives the greater significance to their moral oneness. "Not my will, but thine be done," "Not as I will, but as thou wilt," involve submission, voluntary surrender, to the Father's will; but here the Lord insists on absolute harmony and free cooperation. The bare idea of the Incarnation suggests  the conditions of freedom which might conceivably issue in divarication of interest and aim. Christ declares that the Divine commission of his humanity is the spontaneous and free, but perfect, coincidence of his will with the Father's. Christ's embodiment of the Father's will, and coordination with it, make all his attractiveness to the human soul. His healing, feeding, and satisfying powers become a revelation of the Father's heart. If he will not cast out the coming ones, it is because he came down out of heaven to fulfil the Father's will (see further, vers. 44, 45), to explain the world wide hunger, to meet and execute the will of the Father. The frequent assertions by our Lord in this discourse (and in <a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>) of his descent from heaven as One charged with a full knowledge of the Divine will, implies that the Lord was conscious of pre-existence in the very bosom of God. This was language which, with more of the same import, led St. John to the overwhelming conclusion that the Jesus whom he knew in the flesh was the Only Begotten of the Father - was the Logos made flesh. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a></div><div class="verse">And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this is the will of</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span> (the Father) <span class="cmt_word">that sent me, that</span> (with reference to) <span class="cmt_word">all that he hath given me</span> I should not lose (<span class="accented">sc</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span>) anything, any fragment of it; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the entire mass of humanity thus given to me as the guerdon of my sacrificial work, given by the inward working of Divine grace which issues in their coming and reaching me, no solitary soul should be plucked out of my hand - should be let slip away into perdition or destruction. The claim of a Divine authority and absolute power could not be put more strongly. The care with which the Divine hand can protect every fragment of his universe, and hold it by its everlasting laws and keep it in the career assigned to it from the beginning, illumines this passage. Should the speaker not sustain this stupendous assumption, it is only too certain that he was giving utterance to the most reckless raving. These words cannot be honestly watered down to the language of the influence of an ethical reformer or prophetic messenger. Jesus proceeds to clinch his argument and reassert his claims as follows. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> in proof of the very opposite of the supposition that I can drop one atom of this great charge, <span class="cmt_word">I will raise it up</span> <span class="cmt_word">at the last day.</span> Reuss applies this to the resurrection of each believer on the "last day" of each life, for he seems unwilling to find in the Fourth Gospel any such idea as that of the general resurrection. But cf. <a href="../../par/john/5-29.htm">John 5:29</a>, and observe the repetition as in a wondrous refrain, vers. 40, 44, 54, in which he again speaks of the "last day" - the final consummation of his redemptive work. The next verse shows that the Lord did discriminate between eternal life already bestowed here and now, and the great consequence of such possession in the complete restoration of body as well as life. It is in the continuity and perpetuity of the eternal life that we find the condition of the resurrection life. The "when" of this "last day" is not positively asserted here.

This is the sublime law of Divine arrangement, and the fullest expression of the will of the Father (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>, "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life"). "<span class="accented">Behold and trust</span>." These are the conditions. The steady gaze, the full perception of the Divine Son-ship that is adequately expressed in the Son of man, issues by a Divine arrangement in life eternal. The blessedness of the life of faith, its elevation above the conditions of corruption and decay, are not all which he promises, for he added, <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (perhaps the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is carried on to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, and so the word is in subj. aor. rather than fut. indic., and, if so, the sentence may express the fact), <span class="cmt_word">that I should raise him</span> (not "it;" cf. ver. 39) <span class="cmt_word">at the last day.</span> It is not improbable, as we have seen, that  our Lord uttered these verses (37-40) to the innermost circle of his followers. The first discourse closes with ver. 36. The disciples looked with eager and inquisitive glances at each other and at their Lord, and received these teachings of the Lord concerning the relation he was sustaining to the Father, and the claim he made to be the Almoner of the mercy and minister of the judgment of him that sent him. This great utterance corresponds with the celebrated synoptic recital (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26, 27</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-41.htm">John 6:41</a></div><div class="verse">The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41-51.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="accented">The murmur of the Jews met by additional claim that his</span> "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> <span class="accented">is the</span> "<span class="accented">living bread</span>." The passage here following resumes the narrative of the impression produced by the extraordinary discourse that had preceded. The question of "the Jews" does not turn at all upon the explanation he had just given to his <span class="accented">disciples</span> in vers. 36-40, but goes back to the theme of vers. 29-36. "The Jews" need not be restricted to the Jewish or the aristocratic or bigoted portion of the Galilaean <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but rather to the Jewish authorities of the towns of Bethsaida and Capernaum, who had been stirred up into active opposition by the report of the miracles and of the explanation which the Lord had put upon them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore murmured concerning him</span>. Perhaps in <a href="../../par/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means simply "whisper;" but throughout the New Testament (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-30.htm">Luke 5:30</a>, with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-11.htm">Matthew 20:11</a>, with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>; Wisd. 1:10) it has the malevolent meaning conveyed in the LXX.

"The Jews" did not misunderstand his meaning. They understood it perfectly, and rebelled against it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-42.htm">John 6:42</a></div><div class="verse">And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) - the one to the other, murmuring in critical and angry mood, and not necessarily in his hearing; for he did not reply to their express assertion, and proceeded rather to enlarge and reiterate the great theme which he had already deduced in the hearing of his disciples. Weiss (vol. 3:6) thinks that John has here introduced an amplification which belongs to a totally different connection. <span class="cmt_word">Is not this Jesus, the Son of Joseph</span> - (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>). We cannot argue from this passage whether Joseph was living still or had died. The murmuring is explicable on either hypothesis. The traditionary impression is that "Joseph" had fallen asleep. Either hypothesis is compatible with the language - <span class="cmt_word">whose</span> <span class="cmt_word">father and mother we know?</span> They may have merely meant "whose reputed parentage is well understood," without implying that either one or other no longer lived. The fact of his parentage was admitted. This is an apparent point blank contradiction to the descent of his humanity from heaven. The supposition of the truth of the immaculate and supernatural birth of Jesus is perfectly compatible with the ignorance of the "Jews" about it. This deep mystery of love could not be made matter of public discourse, nor do our narratives suggest that the fact itself was promulgated until after the Resurrection. Whatever was apprehended by the sacred society of the hill country of Judaea, or laid up in the breasts of Joseph and Mary and of the few who pondered these strange things in their holy circle at Nazareth, we know not. The synoptic narratives, though they assert the mystery, do not give the smallest indication that it was ever referred to. or made an article of faith, by Jesus himself The difficulty that besets this passage is rather the silence of John, both here and elsewhere, concerning the manner of the Lord's birth. He, who knew the mother of Jesus, and must have been acquainted with the language of Matthew and Luke, says nothing in vindication of the words of the Lord. Here was an opportunity for putting the "Jews" in the wrong, by endorsing the synoptic account which he did not embrace. We have already seen (cf. notes, <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1-6</a>) that the underlying presupposition of the miraculous birth is the best explanation of his own words. Still his silence is remarkable. It is best accounted for by the fact that he was evermore looking to the moral, spiritual significance of all the miracles he records, as well as of those to which he vaguely refers. He is content with the words of Jesus. They are the surest explanation of the synoptic narrative. The Jews, on the basis of their general knowledge, are struck with consternation. <span class="cmt_word">How</span> (now) <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span> <span class="cmt_word">doth he say, I have come</span>  <span class="cmt_word">down out of heaven?</span> This was not an irrational nor a malignant criticism. This question must have been asked by those who heard for the first time the stupendous claim. It would not seem that these interrogations were put in the heating of our Lord. His "answer" goes back to the "question" as it shaped itself in the hearts of the disciples, and involves some of the deepest truths which he had previously communicated to Nicodemus. He demands and must have a new humanity, a regenerated audience, subjects for his kingdom who are born anew or from above. He who came down from heaven insists that his true disciples must become what he is - heaven born, must have a life out of heaven. They must be "of God," they must "hear" and "learn of the Father," must be drawn by Divine hands, if they would or should come to him. No lip-homage, no fickle desire for the Messianic kingdom, would satisfy him.

In the previous utterance "all" which the Father "gives" to the Son "comes" to him, reaches him, enters into close relationship with him. Here "no one is able" by the nature of the case "to come" except this process and method of a Divine giving is realized. The Father's "giving" to him is described in new terms, as "the drawing" by the Father who hath sent him. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> almost always implies resistless or at least successful force, in the stretching of a sail, the dragging of a net, the force applied to a prisoner, the drawing of a sword (<a href="../../par/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>). It is used also in Attic writers for the internal drawing of desire towards pleasure (Plato, "Phaedr.," p. 238, <span class="accented">a</span>; cf. Virgil, "Ecl.," 2:65, "<span class="accented">Trahit</span> sua quemque voluptas"). Our Lord also uses the word for his own attractive force, for the Divine magnetism of his cross, "If I be lifted up, I will <span class="accented">draw</span> all men to me;" I will counteract all the power of the prince of this world (see <a href="../../par/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>, note). This drawing of the Father to the Son by an internal operation on the heart must be interpreted by the attractive force of the love and sacrifice of the Father which is seen in Christ's being lifted up; and still further explained by his own subsequent assertion in ch. 14, "No man cometh unto the Father but by me." So that, while the whole action centres in Christ, the process begins and ends in the Father's heart. The Father loves the world; the Father would have all men come to him, have access to himself. To secure this Divine result he sends forth his Son with all the attractive force of love and death. This Divine humanity is a sufficient revelation of the perfect will and infinite love of God. The drawing of Christ to <span class="accented">himself</span> is nothing less than the drawing of the Father to <span class="accented">Himself</span>; for Christ came to do the will of him that sent him. Nor is this all, for all the "internal pressing" and revelation of need and peril, the conviction of sin and righteousness and judgment by the Comforter, is at once the Father's drawing and also the attraction of the Son, and the veritable "coming" of a soul through Christ to the Father. The Father "gives" to the Son by this double process: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he manifests his own fatherly heart in Christ; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he opens men's eyes to see the Father in the Son. <span class="accented">No man can come to me except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him</span>: <span class="accented">and I will raise him up at the last day</span>. I, says Christ, "will complete and consummate his life at my great day of coronation and triumph." The several thoughts must be taken together, and they explain one another. The coming of men to the Father, access to God himself in the glory of the resurrection life, is the sublime consummation. Christ is sent, the Only Begotten is given, he is lifted up to draw men by the revelation of the Father's heart to himself, and thus in seeing and knowing that Christ is in the Father and the Father in him, the soul is drawn by the Father to the Son - is drawn by the Son to the Father. Yet the subjective work of the Father in the mind, moving it even to see the full meaning of the Christ and to yield to his attractive force, is strongly suggested. The direct contact of God himself with each soul that seeks, finds, and comes to him through Christ is made evident. There is, as Reuss says<span class="cmt_word">,</span> "la base mystique de la theologic Chretienne," rather than the announcement of a predestinating decree. Even Calvin says, "As to the kind of drawing, it is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful influence of the Holy Spirit which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling."

If the discourse was uttered in the synagogue of Capernaum, this is not impossible.

And they shall all be taught of God; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. direct teaching by God is the prime requisite of any spiritual apprehension, even of the mysteries of Christ the Revealer. This solemn truth is affirmed by the entire history of Christ. The vision of his majesty, even contact with his ineffable love, the sight of his humiliation and of the shedding of his precious blood, did not, by any necessarily acting law of mind, induce faith. Divine teaching by the Spirit of the Father and Son is the preliminary (see notes on John 16:5-8, on the mission of the Comforter) to believing on Christ. "Taught of God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), translated in Vulgate, <span class="accented">docibiles Dei</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>), means more than the reception of one lesson in the school of God, and suggests a prolonged experience and a rich communion between the Teacher and the taught. <span class="cmt_word">Every</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (therefore)  [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, referring to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 45<span class="accented">a</span>, and to the quotation, is not so much every human being, as the "all" of the Messianic kingdom - the "all" of God's "sons" and "<span class="accented">children</span> "] <span class="cmt_word">that hath heard</span>  <span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, and hath learned</span> (<span class="accented">of him</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>cometh unto me.</span> Hearing may end in heedlessness, even when the Lord God Almighty speaks with us. His revelations at great epochs, his inner voice at special moments in our religious history, may be disregarded. The voice of God may be heard, yet not obeyed; the voice of conscience and revelation and inspiration, the sacred monitions and warnings of the heart, may all be slighted. But every one that hath heard the Father, and has also accepted the lesson - has felt the Divine drawing; being willing to do the will of the Father, he knows of the doctrine, whether it be of God, and he comes to Christ. Later on, Christ said, "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." It is one thing to "hear," another to "learn," another to "come." These three stages still further illumine the "drawing" of the Father, and the method which the Father has adopted of so giving men to Christ that he may ultimately fold them in his arms and press them to his heart. Lest, however, the hearers of Jesus, then or now, should conclude that the kind of direct teaching of which the prophets spake, and which he endorsed, was of that immediate kind which himself enjoyed, and which alone justifies this language, he continued -

These words bring our Lord's teaching back to a full justification or reassertion of the statement that he had come down from heaven.

The full acceptance of Christ provides "living water" for the thirsty, "living bread," "bread from heaven," for the hungry - an inward refreshment, a Divine nourishment, an inexhaustible supply. "He that believeth on me" (whether the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;</span> were in the original text or not, they are involved in the sense)has entered on the possession of an eternal blessedness of being, superior to death, transcending time and sense - he "hath eternal life."

The Heaven-given manna by which Jehovah sustained the temporal life of the fathers in the wilderness did not convey the antidote to death. "The carcases [of these fathers] fell in the wilderness." He does not say, "perished out of God's sight forever," or were condemned, but that there was nothing in the eating of manna which arrested, or averted, or triumphed, over death; yet he added: <span class="cmt_word">This</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Bread</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">life</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is the Bread which cometh down from heaven, in order that</span> <span class="cmt_word">any one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">may eat thereof, and may not</span> die. The eating of the Bread of life (the life-giving Bread), which I myself am, the thorough assimilation, the entire acceptance of me as God's Gift of life to the world, confers the very principle of life; and, though a partaker may seem to perish, he does <span class="accented">not die</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51-11:26</a>, notes) - he will not "taste of death," "he will never die." The life will be stronger than death; it will survive apparent extinction. Meyer says that here Christ reserves to ver. 51 the positive offer "of his own concrete Personality, and is exhibiting the true Bread, according to its real nature." Still he has said, "I am the life-giving Bread," and is undoubtedly preparing for the following announcement, which adds a new and startling thought, calculated to sustain the former one.

With this verse We see, instead of monotony, a threefold advance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In place of the life-giving Bread, he declares himself to be as Bread, yet a living Person, possessing therefore in himself the essential principle and energy of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Instead of <span class="accented">coming down</span>, used characteristically or universally, he points to a definite, concrete, historic fact - "that has come down out of heaven." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Instead of saying, "he may not die," we find the glorious assertion, "he <span class="accented">will live forever</span>." The kind of eating of which he speaks becomes clearer; the kind of food, the kind of death, the kind of life, all burst into light which points back to the first great word of this discourse, viz. "Labour tot that food which endureth unto eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for this one the Father, even God, hath scaled." "The miraculous feeding of yesterday was but the metaphor by which I was conveying this thought, that I was providing an inexhaustible supply for the eternal life of that humanity which I have assumed." In the last clause of the verse he made a yet further advance: <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and the bread which I shall give is my flesh</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which I shall give</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for</span> <span class="cmt_word">the life of the world.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of the commencement of the clause show a continuation of the thought with a new departure, coordination, and progress, "Yea, and the bread which I shall give is my flesh." Though the word "flesh" is often described by some of its frequent characteristics and qualities, and might be and has been regarded as the bodily and sensuous nature, and also as the seat of sin, it is,  both by Paul and John, used for the <span class="accented">nature of man</span> as a creature - its totality regarded on its earthly side, the entire "humanity" which Christ assumed, the common antithesis to "spirit" viewed as the Divine supernatural gift to man. He was (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>) "manifest in the flesh," in "the likeness of sinful flesh" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>) - in a flesh free from all sin. He came "in the flesh" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>). This humanity of his he gives, or rather, when he spake these words, he would give, <span class="accented">to be eaten</span>, to be assimilated by faith; and, having reached this point, he added (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if we retain the questioned clause, which, with Meyer and Godet, we see no sufficient reason for discarding), which flesh,which humanity of his, he will further give to be slain and sacrificed for the sake of, or on behalf of, the world. This clause, which the Vatican Codex, etc., reject, proceeds clearly on the supposition that Christ advances here to the prediction and promise of his death. It is so worded as all the more to justify the emphasis he subsequently lays upon the death itself as essential to a full participation in himself. In this verse and closing utterance he prepares for further disclosures, and the flesh of Christ receives explanation from the rich and varied reference to it in the final words of the discourse, where the <span class="accented">flesh</span> is the great metaphor of his Divine humanity, and the <span class="accented">blood</span> is the expressive description of his awful sacrifice. He, the Life-giver, the Living One, the Bread of life, the living Bread, will give himself to what men call death, that they, apprehending fully, adequately accepting the greatness of the Divine gift, may, like himself, transform death (so called death) into the portal of eternal life. These words are the new starting point for this great disclosure. The very inner thought of Jesus seems to shape itself as we read. The Paschal sacrifice, eaten at that season as the sign that the theocratic nation had been chosen to covenant and eternal relation with Jehovah, must have been present to his mind. His own approaching death and sacrifice, by which he would bind those who receive him into an eternal covenant with himself, his relation to the whole world, the gift of the Father to him, the gift of himself to the world by the Father, - all are presented to him, and the movements of his great heart reveal themselves as he proceeds.

They were not unanimous in their judgment. Some said one thing, and others said another. The "Jews" had not yet come to a unanimous opinion that this wonderful Being was talking sheer heresy or incomprehensible mystery. They knew his habit of metaphoric speech, and that underneath common imagery he was in the habit of conveying doctrines the full purport of which was not at once apparent. Some denounced him as uttering an intolerable riddle. Some saw, in a measure, through it, and hated the doctrine that was thereby conveyed. How could <span class="accented">he</span> be so essential to the life of the world? and how, said the pure materialist, "how can he give us his flesh to eat?" A question of great interest arises. He has already identified, in ver. 35, "coming to him," "reaching him" under the drawing of the Father, with the transcendent blessing of life eternal, of victory, over death, and resurrection. In ver. 40 "beholding" and "believing" are cognate or equivalent conditions of life and resurrection. In ver. 47, again, "believing," <span class="accented">per se</span>, is the essential and all-comprehensive condition. Now, has Christ added, in this verse, anything fresh to the fundamental ideas? Let it be pondered that he has already equated "believing" with eating a bread that endureth to everlasting life (vers. 27-29). He has declared himself to be the "Bread of life," and to be appropriated by "coming" and "believing." He has spoken of himself as "living Bread," which, coming for the life of the world from heaven itself, is offered as food. Now, what more than this has he said when he declared that he will offer his "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> as heavenly food? The Jews undoubtedly show, by their mutual contest, that he had put some part of the previous oracle in a still more enigmatical, if not offensive, form. So far the imagery was not altogether beyond them. Here it takes on a form which excites angry controversy. If they understood him to mean "doctrine," "truth," "cause," even "office," as Head of a spiritual school - as one providing by his gracious will ample nutriment for all who would eat of the rich banquet of his words - they would, to some extent, follow him. The eating of the tree of life was a well known figure in Hebrew Scripture (<a href="../../par/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>); cf. the language of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>), the action of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>), and the imagery of Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). In the "Midrash on <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>," "eating and drinking" is said always to refer to the Law (Edersheim and Wunsche). But when he spoke of giving his "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> for the life of the world, he passed beyond the limits of their interpreting power. They did not see through his imagery; nor did Jesus exactly answer the angry query which they were putting one to another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 53, 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to them,</span>  <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and have drunk his blood, ye have not life in yourselves</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He that eateth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "eateth with pleasure, eagerness," is repeated four times, as perhaps a stronger expression than <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> This result, it should be seen, is <span class="accented">identical with the promises made to</span> "<span class="accented">beholding</span>," "<span class="accented">coming</span>," "<span class="accented">believing</span>." Life and resurrection will really follow these acts and conditions; but then it is obvious that "beholding," "coming," "believing," must veritably cover what is contained in this last statement. There is no mere tautology. These words express more fully the original condition. They are not new conditions, but a further imaginative exposition of the former ones. The believing involves an assimilation into the very substance of the believer's nature of that which he here specifies as "flesh and blood." Reuss and Luthardt, and to some extent Moulton, admit that by "flesh and blood" he means no more than "flesh;" that under "flesh" is included "blood;" that by both he simply means "himself." Lunge urges that by "flesh" is meant "human nature" - his "manhood;" but by "flesh and blood" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>), "inherited nature" - the humanity of Christ in "<span class="accented">historical manifestation</span>." But he passes on to say that this manifestation culminates, is completed, in death, and, thus completed, the life of Christ is the nourishment of the real life of man. Tholuck: "The addition of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> only expresses, by its main constituents, the sensible human nature." The great bulk of interpreters take the additional mention of drinking of his blood to connote an entire acceptance of the atoning sacrifice, of the Paschal blood shedding, to be effected for the deliverance of the world (so Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Lucke, Neander, Keim, Meyer, Weiss, etc.). "Eating of the flesh," then, would mean acceptance of his humanity, of the manifestation of the eternal love in the Son of man; and "drinking his blood" would mean entire mental assimilation also of the terrible culmination of his mission in violent, sacrificial death. This momentous condition of life eternal is stated both negatively and positively. Without the participation in this twofold aspect of the Lord and his work, there is no <span class="accented">life</span>. Unless "coming to him," "believing on him," means an acceptance of his humanity, an apprehension of that Personality in whom the Word was incarnate, and an utter surrender of the soul to the rending of that flesh and shedding of the blood which is the life, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the death of the Son of man, it is not the coming to him and believing on him of which he has already spoken. He that does thus eat and drink will satisfy a craving after nourishment and refreshment. Unless a man consciously or unconsciously accepts, absorbs, the sublime and wondrous gift of the Divine humanity from the second Man, the Lord from heaven, rather than from the first man, he has no life in himself. Human nature apart item the new creation and the new beginning is a dying, not a living, entity. The new life quickened by the Incarnation is not all that Christ would give. The blood of the Son of man, to be accepted in the same way. is a further exposition of the object of faith. The "eating" and "drinking" are therefore phrases which portray the very intimate and close form of that contact with, and dependence upon, the incarnation and the sacrifice of the Son of God, which Christ erewhile defines in broader, vaguer metaphor. A great question has arisen on these verses - whether our Lord is pointing to, or making prophetic reference to, the institution of the Eucharist, about which the fourth evangelist is strangely silent.  Certain of the early Fathers - Chrysostom, Cyril, and Theophylact - have given it this meaning, though the great bulk of the patristic writers - Ignatius, Irenseus, Origen, Clemens Alex., Tertullian, and even Cyprian (though the passage may be applied by them to the Eucharist as <span class="accented">one</span> way or method of spiritually eating and drinking the Son of man) - do most obviously interpret the passage itself of direct and spiritual, not the indirect and sacramental manducation of the living Bread. The same view is presented by Eusebius, Athanasius, and Cyril of Alexandria. For the first four centuries all that was done was to apply the argument of ch. 6, in order to press the importance of communicating sacramentally. This led the Romanist writers to go further, and regard the participation in the sacramental body and blood as essential to life eternal. Pope Innocent I., Bishop of Rome, A.D. 402, was the first distinguished man who brought up out of this passage "the necessity of communicating infants;" and from the time of his synodical epistle (A.D. 417) the Latin Chinches interpreted the passage, "Except you receive the Eucharist, you have no life in you." The views of Augustine were vacillating or are dubious. Fulgentius shows that he had, to some extent, broken loose from this narrow view when he concluded that baptism without the Eucharist did convey all the benefits of the body and blood of Christ. Numerous Schoolmen  (see Albertinus, 'De Eucharistia,' lib. <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 30; and Wake, 'Disc. of the Eucharist,' p. 20) rejected the sacramental interpretation, and the Reformers most justly repudiated it. Luther, Melancthon, Beza, Grotius, Owen, Lampe, Cocceius, asserted that the whole construction of the passage, which treats "coming," "believing," as the complete conditions of life and resurrection, must not be held to transform an, as yet, uninstituted ceremonial into the sole method of "believing." Notwithstanding this wide protest, the opponents of the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel - Bretschneider, Strauss, Baur, Thoma, Hilgenfeld, and numerous others - see in this passage the conception of a mystically disposed second-century divine, who placed the Eucharistic ceremony in the lips of Jesus long before the institution. But while this view can be without hesitation rejected, it is obvious that there was a spiritual participation in the "humanity" and the "sacrifice" of the Son of God which Christ called upon the Capernaites to experience - one which must have been possible to Old Testament saints, to little children; to all who are acceptable to God and accepted by him. Such participation is, without doubt, aided and rendered peculiarly possible, thinkable, in the Eucharist. These words were timed, therefore, to bear the rich and twofold sense of Holy Scripture. Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, in every account of the institution of the Supper, is not without special meaning; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> meaning the whole of his humanity, and the entire fulness of the sacrifice for the world; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> suggest that organized personal life in which the Incarnation culminated, and the blood which was shed for the remission of sins. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is not without reference to the new "body" in which the spirit would be ultimately enshrined. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The phrase, "drinking of the blood," is peculiar to these verses. In the Eucharist we "drink of the cup which is the new covenant in the blood of Christ." "The hand of history," says Edersheim, "has drawn out the telescope; and, as we gaze through it, every sentence and word sheds light upon the cross, and light from the cross carrying to us the twofold meaning - his death and its celebration in the great Christian sacrament."

If we cannot assimilate food, we die. It must become part of our life blood and permeate our system; so "the coming and believing" must mean such an acceptance of the Christ that the love of God penetrates our whole being, "even the joints and marrow of soul and spirit;" unless it does so, we have no life in us. Lange, even here, presses the idea of the flesh and blood of Christ as being true food, seeing that by <span class="accented">believing historic</span> contemplation we participate in the "historic form of his manifestation," and by <span class="accented">spiritual</span> contemplation and <span class="accented">fervent faith</span> we drink in the blood which is the life. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is nearly that between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The former is the antithesis of the merely apparent food; the latter would have meant genuine food answering to the ideal of food. "The true food" is the food for the inner man - food <span class="accented">in all reality</span>. The Lord was speaking to them of a unique relation which he sustained to the human race, and which cannot be explained away into some mere euphemism for the blessedness and stimulating character of the gospel message. This is made still more evident by his next words - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-56.htm">John 6:56</a></div><div class="verse">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I</span> (dwell) <span class="cmt_word">in him</span>. This mutual indwelling is illustrated elsewhere (<a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-5</a>) by the image of the vine and its branches. <span class="accented">The vine abides in the branch</span> in the virtue of its life-giving forces. Cut away from the parent stem, it can do nothing. Fruitlessness condemns and fire consumes it. <span class="accented">The branch abides in the vine</span>, as deriving all its worth, its true place, its possibility of growth and fruit, from the vine (cf. also <a href="../../par/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>). The dwelling of the believer in Christ involves an utter self-surrender to him, a recognition of the supreme claims of the God-Man and his work, a complete trust in him as the Source of all life, a sound and abiding place of rest, a justification before God as one with Christ, as one identified with him in his well pleasing to the Father. The dwelling of Christ in the believer is the fulness and riches of the Divine life. Christ liveth in him (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>), thinks in his thoughts, moves through his will. This is sanctification. The believer is in Christ as the members are in the body. Christ is in the believer as God is in his temple. What is  the condition of this mutual indwelling? Christ puts the condition of this Divine interpretation thus: "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him."  The verb is in the present tense, implying the continuous appropriation of the Divine sustenance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-57.htm">John 6:57</a></div><div class="verse">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - Here is the grandest assertion of all. Christ began by speaking of himself as the Bread of God, as the life-giving Bread, as the living Bread of human souls. He made it then clear that he was this by reason of his Divine humanity given for the life of the world. He added to this that he was specially to be appropriated and accepted as a sacrifice, as the death sacrifice, involved in his giving his flesh for the life of the world. The power conferred by his death in life and life in death for man, enabled him to institute eternal life-giving relations between himself and those who entirely accept and make their own this central reality. And now, to meet the nascent objection as to the unique grandeur of his position, he adds: <span class="cmt_word">As the living Father sent me.</span> The phrase, "living Father," occurs nowhere else (cf. "righteous Father," <a href="../../par/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>; "holy Father," <a href="../../par/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>; "the living God," <a href="../../par/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>; and above all, ch. 5:26, "As the Father hath life in himself, so he gave also to the Son to have life in himself"). Christ is speaking of the human position he assumed before them as <span class="accented">sent</span> by the Father who has life in himself, who is more than all his laws or all his works. Not merely as the Word, but as the Word of the living Father made flesh, he stands before them. <span class="cmt_word">And I live because of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father.</span> "Because he lives, I live; my life is guaranteed by his." This is the premiss, the platform on which he now stands (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> must not be confounded with <span class="accented">per Patrem</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as M"Leod Campbell, who, in his interesting discussion on "Christ the Bread of Life," made this expression equivalent to the means and condition of the Saviour's life). From this premiss the Lord argues a corresponding relation of the believer to himself: <span class="cmt_word">So he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.</span> The points of comparison are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Father's life-imparting relation to Christ, and Christ's life-imparting relation to the believer. In both cases the life of one is the guarantee of the life of the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sending of Christ by the Father, correlated with the eating of Christ by the believer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The peculiar relation of the believer to Christ. "He that eateth me" gathers up and really comprehends all that has gone before. It is, then, possible for the believer not only to share in the Divine humanity by his faith, and also in the fulness and significance of iris (blood) death, but to have full possession of his Divine <span class="accented">personality</span>. "He that eateth me shall live because of me" (cf. "Because I live, ye shall live also," <a href="../../par/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>). This is the vindication of the previous verse, and the climax of the argument. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-58.htm">John 6:58</a></div><div class="verse">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - Here the Lord returns once more to the starting point of the discourse. <span class="cmt_word">This is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the bread that came down from</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven</span> (cf. vers. 50, 51). Already he had said, "I am the living Bread that came down from heaven," and he has expanded the statement to show how much was contained or involved in eating it. He has, moreover, emphasized the two sides of his offer of himself to the world, and shown how the twofold reception of beth sides becomes a thorough acceptance of himself, and a twofold identification of himself with his people. He forthwith returns to the original statement, and to its implied contrast with that which these sign-loving Jews had demanded. <span class="cmt_word">Not</span> <span class="cmt_word">as</span> (<span class="accented">your</span> ) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fathers</span> <span class="cmt_word">ate, and died: he that eateth of this bread shall live forever.</span> This is a strong reassertion of the language of vers. 49-51.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-59.htm">John 6:59</a></div><div class="verse">These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things</span> - probably referring to the discourse which followed upon the contest and discussion of the Jews among themselves (vers. 52-58), or it may include the entire discussion from ver. 40 onwards - <span class="cmt_word">he said in synagogue</span> (or, <span class="accented">in a synagogue</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>as</span> <span class="cmt_word">he was teaching in Capernaum.</span> Capernaum is thus distinctly verified as the place whither the multitudes had followed him. It was, as we learn from the synoptists, his second and habitual home in Galilee. In Warren's 'Recovery of Jerusalem,' p. 344, a description of <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span> and of its ruins occurs, and amongst them the remains of an ancient synagogue. "On turning over a large block of stone," says Wilson, "we found the pot of manna engraved on its face." "This very symbol may have been before the eyes of those who heard the Lord's words" (Westcott). This note of time and place is important, as showing that thus early in his ministry our Lord  proclaimed in Galilee, as well as in Jerusalem, the deepest things of his own consciousness and intentions; that the teaching in Galilee was not, as Renan would have us apprehend, nothing more than an idyllic progress of personal popularity and rapturous hosanna. The Lord knew that he must offend those who would by force constrain him to be their Messianic King, and made it by this discourse clear that spiritual communion with his inner life, as a Divine, Heaven-sent Representative, as One suffering and dying for the world, was the only and supreme condition of deriving and sharing in his own supernatural and eternal life. The effect of this discourse and the crisis that followed in his public ministry is now described. The words of Jesus led to deeper faith and to a more determined antagonism. "The light shone into the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not." "He came to his own, and his own received him not; but to as many as received, he gave power to become sons of God."

It does not mean "hard to be understood," but difficult to accept or be content with. Luthardt here reiterates his conviction that there is no reference in it to the death of Christ, and that the disciples were simply unwilling to accept the idea of his supreme claims and his constant return to the. eating and drinking of his flesh and blood and identification of this eternal life with participation in his corporality. But surely Meyer and Wcstcott, etc., are far nearer to the truth in referring the expression to their unwillingness to accept the bloody death of their Messiah, or to entrust themselves to a Divine Personality whose most distinctive act would be his sacrifice. This was the gross and terrible offence which made the cross a stumbling block to the Jew (see <a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2</a>l, etc.). Who is able to listen to him? This seems not only to be the possible, but most probable, translation of the genitive with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>. It was the language, not of "the Jews," but of "the disciples."

Some have argued that our Lord here simply refers to the "resurrection;" that he told his hearers they would have an opportunity of observing that, after death, he would return to where he was before, that is, to the conditions of earthly life. The striking antithesis between "descending from" and "ascending" almost compels the repudiation of this view. Did Christ, however, mean to ask them whether, under the new condition of things, all ground of offence would not be taken away? or to imply that their faith would have to be put to a still greater strain, and that they would stumble at length irretrievably? Lucke, De Wette, Kuinoel, Meyer, chiefly urge the latter, and on the ground: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That in John's Gospel the death of Christ is always looked at as his real glorification, and that therefore by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, he was referring in his euphemistic fashion to his death in the true Johannine phrase as a going to God (cf. <a href="../../par/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>, a return to the Father; 14; 16:5, 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That John does not describe the Ascension as a physical fact. Meyer does not allow that <a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a> and John 20:17 are sufficient with this phrase to justify such a reference to the great event referred to by Mark, Luke, and Paul, and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Against Meyer and those who agree with him it should be noticed that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is never used for "death" of Christ. The phrases, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., are used for this purpose. Moreover, when a phrase was wanted to denote the twofold idea of uplifting on the cross and ascension to the skies, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is the word twice used in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-34</a>). Moreover, if death could be realized as such a <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of glory and fulness of life, the offence of the cross, and scandal of participation in and dependence upon the flesh and blood of Christ, would be reduced  and not augmented. To Meyer's objection that these Galilaean disciples would not see the ascending Christ, and therefore the supposition would be tantalizing, it is sufficient to reply <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, in a similar sense, there was no reason to suppose they would see the Lord suffer and die upon the cross; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, as Christ Jesus was evidently "set forth as crucified" among the Galatians (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>), so these Galilaean disciples, through the vision of the apostles, would verily see the Son of man suffer, die, and ascend. Apart also from the inappropriateness of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> convey the subtle thought of the transfiguration of death as such, there was not, apart from resurrection and ascension to glory - which is the additional matter to which our Lord referred - any justification of the phrase, whereas it coincides decidedly with the expressions used of the pre-existing glory of the great Personality who, though calling himself "Son of man," yet consciously refers to his existence before the world was (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). Again, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of these words stands in imposing antithesis to the repeated use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the previous discourse. He had been sent "from heaven," "sent by the living Father," he had "come down from heaven," "to give himself and his flesh for the life of the world" and he now leads his disciples to suspend their murmuring at the form of his discourse. They may behold and see a greater marvel yet, such a losing of his humanity in God and glory, that they will be able to apprehend more fully what he means by eating his flesh and drinking his blood. Of course, there might be some who are so entirely obtuse to the conception of this close identification with him during the time of his manifestation in the flesh, that they will be still more powerless to receive the spiritual interpretation when, for believing minds, the idea would become clear. John recorded this discourse a generation after the mighty effects of the Resurrection and Ascension had been produced. We know that long before he presented these outlines the ideas presented in it had been widely diffused. St. Paul had spoken of Christ as "the second Man from heaven," as invested and clothed in a "spiritual body," as "the last Adam," as "a life-giving Spirit," and the Epistle to the Hebrews had represented him as "having passed through the heavens that he might fill all things. Whence came such august ideas about the Man Jesus, if not from himself? The offence of the cross has never ceased, and Athenians and many since have mocked at the story of the Resurrection and Ascension; but notwithstanding this, there is an ever-increasing multitude who from the day of his ascension till now have been finally convinced. They have understood, as they would never have done without such help, that it was possible, since he had passed through these heavens that he might fill all things, to hold the most entire and intimate communion with him, both as the God-Man and as the Paschal Lamb. Moreover, the prince of this world has been cast out and judged because Christ has gone to the Father. He has been lifted up, and is drawing all men to himself. When the Son of man in the continuity of his Person shall be beheld as ascending into the glory from which he in his Divine nature descended, then those who stumbled at the idea of intimate life-giving participation in himself will "come to see that the words can only be understood spiritually" (Moulton). The ascension of the humanity to the life and glory of the pre-existent Deity of the Son of God was a conception firmly grasped by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-9</a>), and must have been based on the Lord's own words. It is only by the exaltation of the man into God that we are able to participate in the Divine humanity. Weiss, unfortunately, cannot believe that there was any reference to the visible ascent to heaven, but simply to the termination of his earthly labours. The question, then, of ver. 62 is left to find its own answer and to give its own suggestion. But the interpretation here offered is strongly confirmed by - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a></div><div class="verse">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <i>they</i> are spirit, and <i>they</i> are life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is the spirit that quickeneth</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>, though omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;</span>, is retained by all the principal editors); <span class="cmt_word">the flesh profiteth nothing;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the "flesh" taken by itself, and apart from the life-giving Spirit which is its principium. The antithesis between "flesh" and "spirit" occurs frequently in the Gospel, and is one of the great points of Pauline doctrine. The Lord does not introduce the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. The statement is generalized, though having special reference to himself, or to the spirit and flesh of the Son of man. "Flesh," in neither St. Paul nor St. John, means the sensuous nature as opposed to the intellectual nature; nor does it mean the "body" as antithetic to the "soul" - the organized material frame, to which the Jews were attributing so much and felt to be the guarantee and seal of his spiritual efficiency (Meyer) - but the "creaturely nature," the "humanity" <span class="accented">per se</span> in all its parts. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." Christ <span class="accented">qua</span> his humanity was fashioned by the Spirit, and the Spirit dwelt upon him with iron measurable potence. "The Logos became flesh," but that flesh itself was so ordered and prepared by the Holy Spirit as that it should sustain this lofty companionship.  Christ's own flesh, his nature, his humanity <span class="accented">per se</span>, and apart from the fulness of the Spirit, profiteth nothing. The mere human life, however spotless and ideal, could not be "eaten," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. could not be assimilated, though to some extent it might be imitated; but imitation is not faith. The "glory" that the apostles saw "of the Only Begotten of the Father, the fulness of grace and truth," in and through that wondrous life of Christ, was the glory given to his humanity by the creative Spirit. Apart from this consideration, a manducation of his flesh, even were it physically possible, was useless. It was not possible to participate in his humanity save through the Holy Spirit which generated him and regenerates us. The sentence doubtless points back to the original constitution of man, the specialty of whose life is that it was inbreathed by the Lord God himself. The use of the saying here was to make it still more clear that he gave his flesh to eat, not through any physical process, not through any sacramental rite, but through the Spirit to our spirit. Mr. Sadler, who takes the strong sacramental view of the entire passage, says, however, wisely and forcibly here, "Even flesh cannot be given to a corpse." We receive the gift, we know the love of God, whether sacramentally or not, through the Spirit. Christ does not deny or retract the statement, "Except ye eat the flesh," etc. He simply shows in what sense he meant the <span class="accented">whole mutual indwelling of himself and his people to be understood</span>. The Spirit is the Quickener. The Spirit is the life-fashioning, life-pre-serving Energy. The flesh, the human manifestation, apart from the Spirit which makes that human life the centre of Divine effluence, the focus for its Divine energy, profiteth nothing. Some have taken these words (like Chrysostom) as a contrast between a spiritual and literal interpretation of Christ's words. Luther and many Lutherans have urged the contrast between a right celebration and a merely material use of the sacrament. So more or less Augustine and Olshausen. Canon Westcott seems to limit the original meaning of "flesh" and "spirit," the one to the visible, temporal, corporeal only, and the other to the unseen eternal order of things, and he does not give to "flesh" here the fulness of meaning which it bears in the New Testament; but he says that this utterance is not limited to either of the views just referred to, though it may include them. Archdeacon Watkins remarks, "They think of a physical eating of his flesh, and this offends them; but what if they, who have thought of bread descending from heaven, see his body ascending into heaven? They will know then he cannot have meant this.

The contact of the Divine Spirit with the human spirit is not through teeth and palate, but through mental and moral processes. "Thou hast the <span class="accented">words</span> of eternal life," said Peter (ver. 68). Christ thus works his way back again to the receptivity of the mind and heart of his disciples. Believing is not only "coming," but, as he has before implied, it is the identical process which he has called "eating his flesh and drinking his blood." Christ's words are the ministry of himself, because the chief method of communicating his life-giving Spirit. In <a href="../../par/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4, 7</a> the Lord used both expressions, "I" and "my words," in identical relations: "Abide in me, and I in you;" "If ye abide in me, and <span class="accented">my words</span> abide in you," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64</a></div><div class="verse">But there are some of you that believe not.

"Some," not many, who were following him yet felt that they could not trust - could not accept his greatest revelations, these Divine assumptions, this spiritual position of his. The Divine humanity, the offered life, the cruel death, of the Son of God, the victory over death, the return to the Father, when put into words or when taught in metaphors even, were grounds of offence. The evangelist adds: <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> introduces the explanatory clause of the disciple who testified of these things) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus knew</span> (knew absolutely, rather than came to know) <span class="cmt_word">from the beginning</span> - referring to the commencement of his public ministry, when men began to close round him (<a href="../../par/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43, 48</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24</a>), not from the beginning of time, or the beginning of their unbelief (Kling); he knew by his Divine penetration into their character, by their manner and spirit, and the nakedness and openness of all hearts before him - <span class="cmt_word">who</span> <span class="cmt_word">they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.</span> Westcott here reminds us that the first indication of the sin of Judas occurs in close association with  predictions of the approaching Passion. This foreknowledge of issues is no interference with free self-consciousness in itself. It may imply that the natures thus known contained in themselves the seeds of the future growth. He knew what would be, but he did not compel it. There was possibly some fresh manifestation of feeling, of failing sympathy, even of enmity, which led the evangelist to notice the manner and interpret the mind of the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">me, except it were given unto him of the Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is omitted by R.T. and Tischendorf (8th edit.); the authorities seem here more equally divided); see notes on vers. 37 and 44. Christ has come completely round to the fundamental principles with which he started. The coming to him, the believing on him, the spiritual apprehension of his Divine humanity, the adoring acceptance of his precious blood, the reception of the spiritual life-giving energy which went forth from him in word, depended on the Father's "drawing" - on those fundamental characteristics of appetite and capacity to receive the grace of Christ which are subjective and are referrible to the Father's good pleasure. <span class="accented">Christ</span> does not give the hunger, but the bread. From the beginning he saw the presence of the appetite after that which he came to bestow. Sometimes a morbid absence of all hunger, a moribund cessation of thirst, may be and is transformed into passionate and life-saving eagerness by The sight of food. The Father gives both the hunger and the food, the sense of need and the heavenly supply. The love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, is the drawing of the Father through the Son to himself. The drawing of the Father is the giving of souls to the Son. A fresh thought is here added. This drawing, thus interpreted, is God's gift also to the human soul The question arises - If the Lord knew, why did he choose the traitor, or call Judas into the innermost circle (see ver. 71)? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a></div><div class="verse">From that <i>time</i> many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 66.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon this</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">qua propter</span>). Not "from that time forwards," not a gradual thinning down or departure of some disciples, one today and another tomorrow, but a kind of rush and stampede took place. Those who a few hours before were ready to call him their Messianic King, were entirely disenchanted. The claims of Christ were so profoundly different from what they anticipated that <span class="cmt_word">upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</span> The fascination those felt who had seen some of the excellences of Jesus led them to put themselves at his disposal, to wait upon him, to desert their ordinary occupations. Hence part of the phraseology of redemption was derived from the method of Christ. Men "came" to him; they "followed" him; they "walked" with him; they could "go back," desert, forsake their Lord. These actions of his first disciples have created the vocabulary of the kingdom of God. Christ's teaching tested as well as attracted men. There was a repellent force as well as an infinite fascination. He sifted as well as saved. The very deeds and words that broke some hearts into penitence roused impatient and angry remonstrance in others. There is seen in this Gospel a continual departure and a deepening faith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/6-67.htm">John 6:67</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 67-71.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">The loyalty of the twelve, with a note of prophetic warning</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 67.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said unto the twelve</span>. He spake to them because of the wide defection from his ranks. "The twelve" have never been mentioned before in the Gospel, but this passing reference reveals acquaintance with the fact on the part of the evangelist. He assumes the historic number as perfectly explicable to his readers. The reference to the <span class="accented">twelve</span> baskets in ver. 13 almost presupposes that there were the same number of disciples, and this pathetic appeal is in harmony with the synoptic account of their "call." <span class="cmt_word">Would ye also go away?</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> suggests a negative answer, "Ye cannot wish, can you?" (Meyer). Godet says, on the contrary, "If you wish, you can!" Westcott, "The form of the question implies that such desertion is incredible, and yet to be feared" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/7-47.htm">John 7:47, 52</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-17.htm">John 18:17, 25</a>). The question is far from identical with that query which once more the Lord put to the twelve, after many subsequent months of varied activity and critical discourse, which showed how Jesus had at length broken with the narrow literalism of Judaic privilege, On that occasion he was summing up the varied convictions produced upon the Galilaean multitudes, and he asked, "But whom say ye that I am?" Here he is simply suggesting the possibility, but yet the incredibility, of his desertion by the twelve apostles, merely because he had affirmed the spiritual aims of his entire mission, and had made an unreserved offer of his Divine humanity to their need. The pathos of this inquiry shows how serious a crisis was being enacted. It has reference in its issues rather to himself than to the twelve. The critical school see in this verse the Johannine treatment of the great apostolic confession, and Weiss here agrees with it. Even Godet thinks that two such questions with their answers, under comparatively similar conditions, are improbable. He suggests that the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (ver. 66) points to a great scattering, and that months may have elapsed before the scene  which John here condenses. It is more likely that John omits the later scene, and prefers to give this, which stands closely related with the immediate circumstances (cf. also <a href="../../par/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a>.). The context and surrounding of the scene in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-17</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/8-27.htm">Mark 8:27-29</a> appear to differ in place, occasion, query, and answer, and in the corresponding teaching that followed. The question was "the anticipation of Gethsemane" (Edersheim).

Is there any teacher to rival thee? Can we look for another while we have thee? "Da nobis alterum te" (Augustine). The second part of this immortal reply points clearly back to ver. 63, where the Lord had declared that the words he had spoken to them were spirit and life. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast words of eternal life.</span> Not "the words," which would savour too much of the dogmatic and technical, but <span class="accented">words of life</span> - words which minister the Spirit of life; words which convey the Divine power, even the Holy Spirit, to our minds; words which bring those thoughts before us which we can believe, and believing which, we have eternal life. "Thou hast such words" (cf. for use of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>). The third item of this confession is twofold. <span class="cmt_word">We have believed, and have come to know</span>; so that we now do believe and know that, etc. There is a knowledge which precedes belief, and there are some great facts and ideas about Christ which lead to a higher and to a different belief (see <a href="../../par/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>); but again the fullest knowledge follows belief, a notional and real assent leads to an invincible assent. Faith is the womb of assurance. This richer knowledge is mediated by love. "He that loveth not knoweth not," and the faith that evokes "love" also excites and confirms the "knowledge" that is life eternal (<a href="../../par/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>). That thou art the Holy One of God  The recognition of the nature of the Lord, which fell short of the great utterance of Peter in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>. This was an ascription which the daemoniacs, or the devils, by their lips were ready from the first to proclaim prematurely (<a href="../../par/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34</a>). (On the holiness of Christ, on his entire consecration, and on the fact that he was sealed and sent into the world to do the Father's will, see <a href="../../par/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>.)

"He appointed twelve to be with him, that he might send them forth to preach, and to have power to cast out daemons" (<a href="../../par/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>). This choice was made in the full human self-consciousness and knowledge of their peculiarities. It is morally inconceivable that he, in his Divine foreknowledge, chose <span class="accented">Judas</span> to special reprobation, knowing him then to be devilish in his nature, and so that he might have his character demoralized by this close contact with Christ's holiness, and thus be trained for the damnation of the traitor's sin and doom. Yet this choice, to Christ's human nature and self-consciousness, was early seen to be one which was not softening but hardening the heart of Judas. He brought him nearer to himself, and gave him fresh opportunity of acquiring just ideas of the kingdom and its methods, and by these warnings the Lord was giving him chance after chance of escaping from what, even to the Lord's prophetic human foresight, looked like his destiny. "One of you," says he - "one is devil." Official  relation to <span class="accented">me</span> is not salvation. Even the admission that I am the Holy One of God is not eternal life. We may compare Christ's severe rebuke to Peter, when, after the grand confession (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>), he counted himself worthy to disapprove the methods of his Lord's mercy, "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence to me; thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men." Judas did far worse - he wanted to use the Divine power of his Master for his own personal ends.

Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Tabernacles, was at hand.</span> The last clause supplies a valuable chronological datum. This great climacteric feast of ingathering and joyful memories of all the goodness of Jehovah was held on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>). Consequently, according to John's own statement, six months had elapsed between the transactions at Bethsaida and Capernaum, and those which he now proceeds to describe. During these six months some of the most thrilling events in the synoptic narrative must have been enacted. The Lord "walked in Galilee." He had discussed the whole question of Pharisaic and ceremonial cleansing and food, and the entire principle of revelation and tradition (<a href="../../par/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>. and <a href="../../par/mark/7.htm">Mark 7</a>.). He had given express illustration of his own teaching by venturing even into heathen cities, and there healing the Syro-Phoenician's child. He had journeyed towards the north of Palestine, into the Greek cities of Decapolis (<a href="../../par/mark/7-31.htm">Mark 7:31</a>), and had made a great demonstration of his healing powers on the mountain heights above the Sea of Galilee. There too (<a href="../../par/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-9</a>) he had once more fed multitudes by his word, on the second miraculous meal. It is probable that the multitudes were Gentiles, whose stock of food would have been exhausted by a three days' sojourn; that at least they were not excitable Galilaeans, who might come by force and make him a King. The Pharisees assailed him, asking for a sign. The disciples, by the mouth of Peter, had confessed their faith (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-28</a>) in more explicit form and force than before (<a href="../../par/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68, 69</a>), and Christ had explained in yet more definite terms than in the synagogue in Capernaum the needs be for his Passion, death, and resurrection. The Transfiguration on the mountain, with its ineffaceable impressions, had followed, with numerous miracles, parables, and connected instructions (<a href="../../par/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16, 17, 18</a>.). Jesus walked for six months in Galilee, knowing, as we learn from these verses, that the authorities in Jerusalem were utterly hostile to him, and had neither forgotten nor forgiven the assertion of his special claims when he was on the last occasion in Jerusalem at the unnamed feast (be it the Feast of Passover or Tabernacles, the Feast of Purim or Trumpets). The outburst of  hostility which kept him so long from Jerusalem was circulating in angry vibrations to the very borders of Galilee. The hour for the final conflict was in abeyance until he had preached more explicitly the Divine gospel of love and redemption, and had left the indestructible seed in human hearts. There was malice in Galileo as well as in Judaea, but it took a different form. Thoma regards the sixth chapter as the ideal treatment by the fourth evangelist of the events recorded in the synoptic narrative, and, strangely enough, treats the wonders on the sea and on the land as parallels to the synoptic account of the temptation! The objection to this is not so much the underlying dissimilarity of idea as the chronological position assigned by Matthew and Luke to the temptation before John was imprisoned, whereas these events occur after his execution. Further, the synoptists record these two miracles in their proper place in the biography <span class="accented">as well as</span> describe the temptation. That the deep inner meaning and teaching of ch. 6. corresponds with that of the last Supper, no reader can miss; nor that this confession of Peter is the highest point of the earlier and later narratives we do not question; but their striking resemblance to each other, instead of transforming this Gospel into a philosophical allegory, appears to us to prove that we have the same historic Christ in Both narratives. The Feast of Tabernacles, the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or tent pitching, called by Philo <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, was the last great feast of the sacred year. It had its relation to the natural and providential goodness of God. Just as the Passover commemorated the opening of the harvest and the first fruits of the grain, and as Pentecost celebrated the completion of the harvest, so the "Tabernacles" implied the ingathering of the fruit of the vine and of the olive, and summed up the joyful acknowledgments for the whole year. Again, as the "Passover" recorded the deliverance from Egyptian bondage by the destroying angel who spared the blood sprinkled home, and the "Pentecost" probably (Maimonides) commemorated the giving of the Law, so the "Tabernacles" recalled in a festive form the time of Israel's wandering in the wilderness, when they dwelt in tabernacles. Joyfulness and astonishing ceremonial characterized the festival. The city of palaces broke out into booths of trees and leaves in every possible space, on walls and housetops in courtyards, and even in waggons and on the backs of camels. The people carried their palm branches and citrons in their hands, and great merriment, almost suggestive of heathen rites, prevailed. It probably gathered up about it, as some Christian festivals have done, other ancient or surrounding customs. The number of bullocks sacrificed during the seven days - one fewer on each day, beginning with thirteen - amounted in all to <span class="accented">seventy</span> (13+12+11+10+9+8+7  =   70). This the rabbis regarded as referring to the seventy nations of heathendom. Additional peculiarities were conspicuous in the immense number of priests who were required to take part in the sacrifices. The blasts of priests' trumpets which regulated the ceremonial, the great musical procession employed in brining water from the Pool of Siloam, then within the city wall, added another noticeable feature. The water was brought in a golden goblet, and poured into a silver funnel, which conveyed it by pipes to the Kedron, and was thus supposed to bless the thirsty land. This act was accompanied by singing the great <span class="accented">Hallel</span>, and the shouts and songs of Zion were heard far over hill and valley. At night time universal illumination prevailed, and huge candelabra in the temple court shed a radiance over the whole city. These peculiarities of the feast rendered it the most popular, if not the most sacred, of all the feasts ('Ant.,' 8:04, 1, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). It was a time when the national sentiment often burst into fierce flame. Various historic glories of the past were called to remembrance, and spiritual privileges were symbolized in the ritual. The fact that the feast held this important place in the affections and enthusiasm of the people explains the anxiety of the family of Jesus that, whatever his claims really were, they should be canvassed in the metropolis and decided by the only authorities adequate to the task. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His brethren therefore</span> (pointing to the high significance of this national and triumphant feast) <span class="cmt_word">said unto him.</span> These brethren were (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>) James, Joses, Simon, and Judas, and, without entering once more on the much-debated question of their actual relation to Jesus (see <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>, and notes), it may be said that this passage in a very marked manner discriminates them from the apostles or disciples, and practically negatives the "cousin" theory derived from the supposed identification of Alphaeus with Cleophas, and consequently of the sons of Alphaeus (James, Judas, and Simon) with the apostles of the same names. The lack of sympathy shown by these men, and the positive assertion of their non-belief  in Jesus, is incompatible with the great confession so recently made (ch. 6:68, 69), and cannot (with Hengstenberg and Lange) be diluted into imperfect appreciation of claims which they wished in a secular sense to press forward to full assertion. They appeared here to criticize their Brother's prolonged absence from Jerusalem, and his abstention from the Passover and other national festivals. They would, perhaps sincerely, hurry forward his public demonstration, and compel him to say to the great world what he had been saying in Galilaean villages, in the borders of Tyre, and in the cities of Decapolis. <span class="cmt_word">Depart hence, and go into Judaea</span>. "This is the time and place." Thoma sees in this advice the same idea which, on the mount of Transfiguration, was suggested by Moses and Elijah "concerning the departure which the Lord was to accomplish in Jerusalem." The Johannist has clothed the same material insinuation in a dialogue (<span class="accented">dialogische Verhandlung</span>). It has been said that this kind of advice is rather in favour of the hypothesis that these brethren were elder than Jesus, and possibly the children of Joseph by an earlier marriage, who thus took upon themselves the function of advisers. Such a hint, however (given by Westcott), seems very shadowy confirmation of the theory. Younger brothers would be just as likely to err in the same direction. <span class="cmt_word">In order that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.</span> The words "thy disciples" may (Godet, Luthardt formerly) have had special reference to the fact that our Lord had made in Judaea "more disciples than had John" (<a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>), that there were even members of the Sanhedrin who had to some extent looked favourably upon him (<a href="../../par/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>), and needed confirmation of their faith. There may also have been tacit reference to the circumstance recorded in ch. 6. that his <span class="accented">Galilaean</span> disciples had deserted him; but it is more likely (Meyer) that the brethren took it for granted that those who in numerous places had received his word would be gathered together in Jerusalem, and would have an opportunity of seeing with their own eyes and in consociation with each other the works of healing and might which were being variously reported, canvassed, and disputed in the schools of Galilee. "Thy disciples" is a wide word, and may easily refer to all who, whether in Jerusalem or Galilee, went by his name. It is a designation which, however, does not include the speakers. "The works which thou art doing" is sufficiently illustrated from the group of remarkable events which had eternalized the previous twelve months of the Galilaean ministry (see on ver. 1).

So Luthardt: "It denotes that which is <span class="accented">open</span>, in contrast to that which is <span class="accented">concealed."</span> Westcott settles the meaning of the word by the remark that "the phrase (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) is commonly used by the rabbinical writers for 'in public,' as opposed to 'in secret.'" The man who persists in quiet, secret ways of acting, and strenuously avoids publicity, is not the man who seeketh to be illustrious and conspicuous. The brethren see a palpable contradiction between the claims which Jesus is making and the comparative retirement to which he is confining himself. The crowds of the Galilaean lake are blank retirement when compared with the metropolis in the great climacteric festival of the year. The brethren call on Christ to solve the contradiction. It cannot be concealed that Jesus had (<a href="../../par/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>) repeatedly said, "No man lighteth a lamp and putteth it under a bushel, but on a candlestick," etc.; and so the brothers use Christ's words against himself. But the Lord's idea of needful manifestation, both as to degree, time, and place, was accurately realized and represented in both narratives. <span class="cmt_word">If thou doest these things</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;</span> is simply the logical premise, without necessarily throwing doubt on the facts. It is not equal, however, to the particle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "since." Admitting these works to be real, and these mighty deeds to be correctly reported, there, is from the standpoint of the brethren no other course than that which they suggest: <span class="cmt_word">Manifest thyself to</span> <span class="cmt_word">the world;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "proceed to the widest arena at once;" "thou art compromising thyself by thy retirement;" "what thou art doing with one hand thou art undoing with the other." "All the Israel world from all lands is crowding to the great feast, thy disciples amongst them;  make thyself known; claim the place that belongs to thee." It must be remembered that the disciples (Judas, not Iscariot, especially) said on the very night of the Passion, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?" This slight note of resemblance with the form of the present admonition of the brothers, is more coincident in the letter than the spirit, and received from the Lord a profoundly different reply (see <a href="../../par/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22, 23</a>, notes). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For not even did his brethren believe in him.</span> The evangelist, writing a generation later, and keenly remembering the attitude the brothers had assumed before the Resurrection, adds, "not even his brothers," who ought to have been the most prominent of his disciples, "did up to this time believe on him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entrust themselves to him, dispose of their prejudices, change their conceptions, accept his spiritual lead, acknowledge his Divine mission, or know him to be the Holy One of God. They had not come into the position of the twelve. What ideas soever they grasped fell immeasurably short of "eating his flesh and drinking his blood," of coming to him, being given to him and drawn to him by the Father. It was a world Messiah, a theocratic King, a Prophet-Captain, a royal Christ, that they sought and would have been glad to find in him. This treatment of the Lord was another striking parallel to the temptation of Jesus as described by the synoptists, "All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me" (see note on ch. 4, and Introduction, VIII. 5). The non-belief of the brothers is in remarkable unison with the widespread unbelief of the people, who were anxious to discern the Christ of their own traditional expectations, and ready to press almost any possible claimant to premature demonstrations. The Pharisees and the people sought some sign from heaven. But while the people demanded it, they expected that he would and might gratify them if he chose. The Pharisees cynically tempted him to proclaim what they believed would prove his irremediable failure (Weiss, 'Life of Christ.,' vol. 3. Eng. trans., pp. 167-188).

This language corresponds with the reply to his mother, "My hour is not yet come" to do what you blindly desire. The kind of manifestation he subsequently made on that occasion was one of love to the needy, not one of power to dazzle the world (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). The underlying thought which the postponement suggested was that the approach of Jesus to Jerusalem with the pilgrim throng would be the signal for the final outburst of bitter hostility which he knew was smouldering in the hearts of the Sanhedrists, and would also be the torch applied to the magazine of combustible passion in which he would sacrifice his life. <span class="cmt_word">But your time</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">season which is yours</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is always ready.</span> The brothers were at liberty at any time to show themselves and their works to the world. They had plans akin to those of the world. They shared the fashion of religious thought, the ideal of the Israelitish world, completely. James, for instance, Nazarite though he may have been, punctilious in traditionary ritual, and honouring the conservative passions of his order, might at any time secure the acclamations or approval of the chief powers of the world - their little world. "I" (Christ implied) "wait for the predetermined hour, for the kind of appearance in Jerusalem which will be the giving of my flesh for the life of the world. You are so much in harmony with the world that at any time you may say all that is in your heart. If I go as you suggest, it must be as Messiah; you go as pious pilgrims to share in this national celebration." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The world cannot hate you; but it hateth me, because I bear witness concerning it, that its works are evil.</span> The "world" is here used in the current Johannine sense of "humanity unregenerate, humanity without grace, or apart from God." The hatred of the world to Christ was pressing down upon his spirit like an intolerable load. He admitted that, from its own standpoint, there was some justification for the feeling. The world hates its censor; it repels the judgment passed upon it. It is satisfied with itself and its own idea of righteousness. It is satisfied with its own standards and cries and professions, so that to be accused of wrongful notions, of a depravity under the clothing of Pharisaic propriety, of a hidden leprosy which is eating into its vitals, rouses all its animosity. If Christ were to go, he must deliver his soul. Already the thunder peal of <a href="../../par/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22-25</a>, to be shortly delivered after full assertion of the nature of his work, and in the metropolis of the theocracy, was hurtling in his soul, and he foresaw the outburst of maddened rage which would follow; but with melancholy and some gentle irony he said, "<span class="accented">The world</span> against which I have to deliver my prophetic burden <span class="accented">cannot</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, moral impossibility) <span class="accented">hate you!</span> Your aim is to fall  in with its demands, to realize its corrupt and unspiritual dreams.

Not as a pilgrim, not in triumphal procession, would he go to the Feast of Tabernacles. He reserved that solemn sacrificial act for a later occasion, He would suffer as the Paschal Lamb, not go to Jerusalem to assert the completion of its acceptable year, and to foment the self-satisfaction of its religious guides. This is not satisfactory, because there is no feast the special features of which seemed to furnish our Lord with more obvious illustrations of his own work and Person. Moreover, he did make his appearance in the midst of the feast. So Godet and Meyer accepted the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span>, and urge therefrom the fact that Jesus deliberately altered his intention, so soon as a new motive sufficiently strong presented itself. With the assistance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>, or with such an emphasis upon the present tense (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>) as to make it equivalent to the introduction of a <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, the passage means. "I am not going up <span class="accented">now."</span> Chrysostom, Lucke, De Wette, see in this suggestion the solution of the problem and a preparation for what follows. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "nigh" (ver. 2), may reasonably be interpreted with more latitude than is generally done. It might easily mean a date sufficiently near to be the topic of conversation in the family circle, even were it still a month before the celebration. The preparations may have been made, the pilgrims were beginning to assemble for their long journey, and the "not yet" and the emphasis on the present tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> may easily have been conditioned by some of the special work which had still to be completed in Galilee on the way to Judaea and Persea. <span class="cmt_word">Because my season</span> - my special opportunity - <span class="cmt_word">has not been yet fulfilled;</span> or, <span class="accented">fully come.</span> Probably this clause points to the completion of the predestined hour of his consummation, of the baptism with which he should be baptized, the fire that he would kindle, the work which he would finish. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-9.htm">John 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having said these things to them, he abode in Galilee.</span> Such a respite cannot mean a few days only. Not until after this period, and possibly after the brethren had started on the pilgrimage, did "he steadfastly set his face to go up to Jerusalem." A great question arises as to the possibility of harmonizing this journey with the great intercalated portion of Luke's Gospel (<a href="../../par/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-18:31</a>). This is not the place to consider the numerous and complicated problems involved. One thing is certain - that the synoptists all describe the final departure from Galilee, which followed a period of partial retirement from the multitude, and of instructions, miracles, and advice rendered in the inner circle of his immediate followers. They also (<a href="../../par/matthew/17-24.htm">Matthew 17:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17</a>; and <a href="../../par/mark/10-1.htm">Mark 10:1</a> especially) indicate that, on our Lord's journey to Jerusalem after closing his Galilaean ministry, he went into Judaea, and thence to the land of Peraea on the other side of the Jordan. This latter statement is perfectly in harmony with John's representation (<a href="../../par/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>), where, after an extended journey in Judaea and the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, we hear that he spent three months beyond Jordan Numerous critics, whose views are well entitled to consideration, urge that on this occasion our Lord did resume his Galilaean ministry and effect his final departure as described in <a href="../../par/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1</a>. Now, the circumstantial way in which Luke describes incidents upon the last journey to  Jerusalem leads many to look for the full chronological detail of this last transaction. It contains, however, many incidents between <a href="../../par/john/9.htm">John 9</a>:51 and John 18:31, where the final events of the last approach to Jerusalem are brought into chronological relations with the other three Gospels, which could not all have been connected with the journey to the Feast of Tabernacles. Edersheim and Weiss alike infer that, since Luke says nothing of the Feast of Tabernacles, he has reckoned in this period the events appertaining to the Peraean ministry and the return to the Feast of Dedication, as well as the final determination to challenge the authorities at Jerusalem, with his assertion of true Messiahship, and the last approach to Jerusalem. Luke does not describe the route taken, but implies on several occasions Christ's growing determination to confront Jerusalem; and also implies that he had visited it "often" (<a href="../../par/luke/13-31.htm">Luke 13:31-34</a>), with the purpose of gathering it under his gracious sway and protection. There are, moreover, a few incidents mentioned which synchronize with the journey to the Feast of Tabernacles. He went through Samaria instead of by the frequented Peraean route on the other side of Jordan (<a href="../../par/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52</a>). There the Samaritans refuse to receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem, and the Boanerges are rebuked for their Elijah-like desire. The incident of the cure of ten lepers, one of them a <span class="accented">Samaritan</span>, probably belongs to the same journey; and, above all, the interesting fragment of the visit to Martha and Mary at a certain village. This village may, as Edersheim suggests, have been the retirement from which our Lord emerged in the midst of the Feast of Tabernacles. Many other of the narratives belong to the closing period of our Lord's life. The most difficult event to harmonize with the suggestions of this passage of John and with the subsequent hints of chronological arrangement, is the choice of the seventy disciples, which Weiss regards as a kind of misapprehension, but which Edersheim (<span class="accented">loc cit.</span>,vol. 2:135) believes to have been one of the great events of this journey to the Feast of Tabernacles. It must be admitted that it is strangely inconsistent with the journey which was conducted as it were "in secret." It would be more natural to believe that it was one of the incidents of the ministry in Peraea, of which Mark gives traces, and for which John provides the true place (<a href="../../par/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>). Lunge and Godet argue that between the departure from the capital (ch. 9.) and the Feast of Dedication, our Lord resumed his work in Galilee, and there pursued the abundant ministry recorded between <a href="../../par/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>. and 18. (see notes of Godet and Lunge, 10:22; 10:40); and that the final departure from Galilee was with a great convoy. Ewald and Meyer regard this as a violent attempt at harmonistic arrangement of the details before us. To resume the narrative - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-10.htm">John 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when his brethren were gone up to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">feast,</span> <span class="cmt_word">then</span> <span class="cmt_word">went he also up, not manifestly, but as it were in secret</span>. The emendation of the text is important, for it draws attention to the fact that, while the brethren went up <span class="accented">to the feast</span>, he simply <span class="accented">went up</span>, towards Jerusalem - not, however, in the pilgrim caravan, but as a quiet wayfarer, blessing lepers, comforting souls, pouring forth on a favoured few his truth, till he reached the certain village at the very gates of Jerusalem. What a contrast there was between the first visit (ch. 2.), when he appeared suddenly in the temple, and cast out the money changers, or that when (ch. 5.) he went to the "unnamed" feast as a pilgrim! The hostility has deepened; the "world" hates its Saviour, because he would save it from its sins, interpret it to itself, and offer spiritual rather than temporal benediction. The phrase, "in secret," has led some of the Tubingen school to suggest a docetic view of the Person of Christ; but the suggestion is reckless and absurd. Moulten, who conceives that the mission of the seventy disciples preceded this advent, says even this does not clash with the idea of a virtually secret and retired advance.

Those who believed in the "goodness" of Jesus were silenced, or did not proceed beyond a feeble murmur of applause, however much some may have felt the truth of their own impression. Those who came to an adverse opinion were also so much cowed by the "Jews," by the ecclesiastical authorities, that even they did not venture to express themselves save "with bated breath and whispered humbleness," lest they might err in the form of their condemnation. The section vers. 14-36 contains three discourses: one of which (vers. 14-24) describes the nature and ground of his human ministry; vers. 25-29, while treating the insolence of the multitude, portray an animated scene of conflicting opinion, in the course of which the Lord renewed the assurance of his Divine <span class="accented">origin</span>, as well as of the Divine sources of his teaching; vers. 30-36 refer to his approaching death or departure, as part of a Divine plan concerning him.

We can only conjecture the theme of these instructions. They must have been sufficiently varied and peculiar to have excited much attention. Either parable, or apothegm, or stirring appeal, or quotation and interpretation from the Old Testament, or voice from the fathomless depths of his own consciousness, may have formed its staple. In his burning summons to conscience, and his gracious offers of mercy, the people who had listened to him on the mountainside or lakeside were accustomed to say, "He speaks with authority, not as the scribes." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore marvelled,</span> <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, etc. "The Jews," as elsewhere, mean the ruling and learned class, the men of power and weight in the metropolis, who must have heard his teaching. The immediate effect of the appearance and words was great astonishment. In spite of themselves, they are moved by the command he manifested over all the springs of thought and feeling. The point of their astonishment is, not that he is wise and true, but that he could teach without having been taught in their schools. <span class="cmt_word">How doth this man know letters?</span> (not the "Holy Scriptures," <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, nor <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, but simply <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, literature, such as we teach it; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>). He can interpret our oracles; he is acquainted with the methods of teaching, <span class="cmt_word">though he has not learned</span> - has never sat in any of our schools. Saul of Tarsus was brought up at the feet of Gomaliel. And ordinarily a man was compelled to undergo a lengthened noviciate in the schools before he was allowed to assume the office of a teacher. The inherited wisdom of the past is in the great majority of cases the basis of the most conspicuous teaching of the most  original and unique of the great sages. The "Jews" were sufficiently acquainted with the origin and training of Jesus to be astonished at his knowledge of the interpretations of Scripture and other wisdom. "This tells powerfully against all attempts, ancient and modern, to trace back the wisdom of Jesus to some school of human culture" (Meyer). The attempts to establish a connection between the teaching of Christ and the hidden wisdom of the Zendavesta, or esoteric utterances of Buddha, or even the traditionary teaching of the Essenes, or the Platonizing schools of Alexandria or Ephesus, have failed. The mystery of his training as a man in the village of Nazareth is one of the evidences given to the world that there was an unknown element in his consciousness. He had not even the advantage of the schools of Hillel or Gamaliel. His own wondrous soul, by much pondering on the genuine significance of the Scriptures, is the only explanation to which even his enemies can appeal. Jesus knew the meaning, heard the murmuring of their surprise on this head, and so we read - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>  <span class="cmt_word">answered them and said</span>, etc. He met this particular allegation as follows: <span class="cmt_word">My teaching is not mine.</span> The "my" refers to the teaching itself, the "mine" to the ultimate authority on which it rests. I am not a self-taught Man, as though out of the depths of my own independent human consciousness I span it. I do not mean you to suppose that my mere human experience is the sole source of my instructions (ch. 5:31). If you have sat at the feet of those who taught you, I, too, am a Representative of another; <span class="cmt_word">but</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> is not equivalent to <span class="accented">tam...quam.</span> It introduces here the absolute source of all his teaching) it is the teaching <span class="cmt_word">of him who sent me.</span> I have not learned in your schools, but am uttering the thoughts that come from an infinitely deeper source. "He who sent me" gave them to me. I have been in intimate communion with HIM. All that I say is Divine thought. I have drawn it all from the Lord of all. I came from him, and represent to you the will of God. This is a lofty prophetic claim, more urgent, more complete, than that made by Moses or Isaiah. Special messages, oracles, and burdens were delivered by the prophets with a "Thus saith the Lord." But Jesus says <span class="accented">his</span> thoughts are God's thoughts, his ways God's ways, <span class="accented">his</span> teachings not his own, but altogether those of him who sent him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a></div><div class="verse">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The moral test is then applied to the great dictum which he had just uttered. <span class="cmt_word">If any man willeth</span> - not merely desires, but performs the distinct act of willing - <span class="cmt_word">to do his will</span> - as his will - <span class="cmt_word">he shall know;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his intellectual faculty will be quickened into high activity by this moral and practical effort. If the Divine will concerning conduct meets the spontaneous act of the human will, if a man's will is set to fulfil the Divine will, to will and do what is revealed to him by God, the eye of the soul will be opened to see other things as well, and especially will have power to discern the all-pervading Divine element in this teaching of mine. <span class="cmt_word">He shall know concerning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the teaching, whether it be of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God, or whether I speak from myself</span> - from the simple ground of my own independent, self-taught humanity. The first and natural application of this mighty dictum and condition was a test by which the Jews might come at once to the understanding of his more than prophetic claim to teach - he having never learned in their rabbinical schools. It amounted to this: Your moral harmony with the will of God as already revealed to you will be the sure index and confirmation of the great fact I have just referred to. You will discern the Divine in my words, the absolutely true in my teaching. Here the Lord again refers to the great principle, "He that hath heard of the Father, and learned, cometh unto me;" "He that is of the truth heareth my voice." This moral submission to God will quicken all your powers to discern and come to an invincible assent as to my claims. This is not the deep subjective testimony of the inner intuition of those that already believe, by which a verbal assent becomes a fall consent, an unchangeable conviction, or "the full assurance of faith;" but it is addressed to <span class="accented">unbelievers</span>, and assures those who are bewildered by the novelty and sweep of his own words that, if they are set on doing the will of God, they will become perfectly satisfied that his own teaching, such as it is, is a stream of heavenly truth bursting from the very heart of God. The text has been cited by certain writers as the sum totel of the Christian revelation, almost as though it substituted practical obedience for true thinking, as though people might well be content with holy living, and might safely leave the decision of all difficult problems of thought and revelation to shift for themselves. Nothing could be further from its real meaning, either at the time or in any of its subsequent  or universal applications. The solemn utterance has a wide outlook, and is constantly establishing its own verity. A profound and voluntary desire to do the will of God is the best preparation for intuitively perceiving the Divine authority of Christ and of his religion. The desire for holiness of principle and life sees in Christ not only the loftiest ideal of perfection, but the surest satisfaction to its conscious weakness, and casts itself upon his promises of saving power. The faith which is satisfied with Christ is not merely a conclusion drawn by logical processes from satisfactory premisses, it is the consequence of a new nature or a moral regeneration. In other words, it is the more practical and expanded form of the truth first of all addressed to Nicodemus, and also lying at the heart of the Beatitudes: "Except a man be born anew [from above], he cannot see the kingdom of God." If he is born again he <span class="accented">will</span> see it. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." "No man can come unto me except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him." The sentence presents the truth in a hopeful and positive form, and puts the criterion of the Divine informant within the reach of practical ethics. It is an appeal to the conscience as well as to the understanding. Apart from the subjective moral element, all other evidences of the presence of the Divine in nature, in history, in Christ, will be unimpressive and unimportant. A willingness to do the will of God is not a substitute for, but a condition of, true knowledge. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a></div><div class="verse">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The following sentence is perfectly general and applicable to all teachers of Divine truth, though it only reaches its highest expression in Christ himself. But while it has numerous applications, its first use is to ratify the previous statements, and prepare the way for what is to follow. <span class="cmt_word">He that speaketh from himself.</span> This was an act which he, in his own case, disclaimed. The "himself" was here the personality which then was in question as a human Teacher. <span class="accented">He that speaketh from himself</span> as the Source of all his instructions. He who would take the credit of being the primal Cause and Orion of the message which he delivers is a man who <span class="cmt_word">seeketh his own glory,</span> his own reputation, at the expense of those who instructed him. The Jewish schoolmen were most anxious at all times to found their instructions on Rabbi "This," or "That," who had himself quoted from some more ancient father of their erudition. A man who should presume to teach in his own name would be one who was manifestly not seeking any higher end than his own glory. Ambition of personal glory and renown is the very thing the absence of which the multitude condemned in Christ's case. The brethren of Jesus had tauuted him with the lack of bold self assertion. Our Lord's own position just taken was that his teaching was not self-originated, but was the teaching or message "of him that sent him." <span class="cmt_word">But whoso</span> (he added) <span class="cmt_word">seeketh the glory of him that sent him</span>, whether the sender be a mortal man and earthly teacher, or be the Lord God of the whole world, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "whoso loses his own individual purpose in the will of God, and is content to be nothing so that God may be glorified," <span class="cmt_word">this person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is true,</span> trustworthy; his message is not perverted by any of the contaminating influences of the self-hood, or flesh, <span class="cmt_word">and there is no unrighteousness</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)diki/a</span> is a stronger antithesis to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> than <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is. It is the moral basis out of which falsehood springs) - <span class="cmt_word">no unrighteousness in him.</span> The sentence is general, but has its prime application to Christ's own ease. It is a reply to the charge that "he deceiveth the people." It is a further challenge to those who are willing to do the will of God. It is a summons to proceed a step further, and recognize the fact that the glory of God, and not his own glory, was the sole end of his teaching, and that the direct command from him that sent him formed the substance of his doctrine, however much it might clash with their preconceived ideas or dominant prejudices. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-19.htm">John 7:19</a></div><div class="verse">Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Jesus was not unaware that serious charges were brought against his interpretation of the sabbatic law; that the Jews sought to kill him for his identification of his own mind and working with the Father's mind and working. On this account for a considerable time he had confined his ministry to Galilee. The old story of the sabbath healing was now rife once more, doubtless augmented with the rumors of the healing of the man with the withered hand, and other actions profoundly in harmony with the deep meaning of the sabbath rest. To the mind of the fourth evangelist; the explanation given by Christ to the authorities in Jerusalem was of prime significance in the whole sabbatic controversy; and he has recorded the defence Jesus made of his doctrine which placed him at once on the platform of the men with whom he was now beginning a life-and-death conflict. He used their methods, and, so far as the adequate grounds of connection were concerned, he was triumphant, <span class="cmt_word">Did</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> <span class="cmt_word">Moses give</span>  <span class="cmt_word">you the Law?</span> - the whole revealed Law of God concerning moral conduct and daily ritual, a violation of the real spirit of which would be <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and of which you accuse me - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> (yet) <span class="cmt_word">none of you doeth the Law?</span> Does he here call attention to the universal disobedience of mankind? Is he forestalling the declaration that "all have sinned, and come short;" that "in many things all offend"? Certainly not. He is about to show at greater length that the charge of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> stands equally against the justifiable transposition of the letter of the lower law by the incidence of a higher law. They must all know the innumerable occasions in which the letter of the law of the sabbath gave way to the law of mercy, to the law of hunger, to the exigencies of the temple services. "None of you doeth the Law," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the sense in which you are (from other motives) expecting me to do it. He said enough to strike their consciences and charge home their cherished if secret purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Why do ye seek to kill me?</span> With what right, since this is the case, do ye vent your malice against <span class="accented">me</span>?

The interpretation of many - that the intention or desire to kill Jesus is the inward proof that the conscience of the Jews would admit that they were not keeping the Law which said, "Thou shalt not kill" - is very far-fetched, and weak in its force, although, according to the entire old covenant, there was much killing which was not murder. Such a reference would not correspond with the profoundly Hebrew response made by our Lord. Calvin here makes this reply of Christ a text on which to denounce, in his own day, the corruption of the papal court.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22</a></div><div class="verse">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses on this</span> <span class="cmt_word">account</span> (for this cause) <span class="cmt_word">hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">given</span> (assigned) <span class="cmt_word">you</span> <span class="cmt_word">the circumcision</span> (<span class="cmt_word">not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers</span>). If we accept the text as above, the question arises - Does it refer to the parenthetical clause or to the principal verb? Meyer renders as follows: "Therefore Moses gave you circumcision, not because it originated with Moses, but (because it originated) with the fathers, and so ye circumcise," etc., making the precedence of the law of circumcision to the sabbatic law part of the very purport of his appointment. But many others, "For this cause" - to teach this lesson - Moses, who gave the ten commandments, one of which involved the sabbatic rest,  took up into the Law which he gave you the still older law of the Abrahamic covenant, and laid down the stringent rule that the rite must be performed on the eighth day (<a href="../../par/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>) - a principle which was seen to involve the infringement of the sabbath law. This is, in substance, the view of Moulton, Lange, Westcott, and others.

Moses did not give circumcision because it was of the fathers, - at least that is not the point; but Jesus argues that he gave circumcision as a mode of legislation which will involve a modification of his own sabbatic regimen. Stringent as was the law of the sabbath, it would have, on occasion, to yield to the more searching and stringent rule of admission into the covenant of grace. "If the sabbath could give way to a mere ceremonial law, how much more to a work of mercy, which is older and higher than any ritual!" 'Mish. Sabb.,' 19:1, fol. 128, <span class="accented">b</span>, "Everything required for circumcision may be completed on the sabbath;" and so 19:2.

The common custom of the people was to adminster this rite on that day, even if it fell on a sabbath. "None of you keepeth the Law" in its Strict integrity, said Jesus. Nay, it is certain that the older laws, which Moses endorsed and embodied in his own code, do themselves demand such violation from you. This appeal to the spirit of the Law - the closest approach that a Jew could make to the will of God - is reproduced in Paul's Epistles (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a><span class="cmt_word">).

Of the former there does not seem the faintest trace, notwithstanding the conjecture of Lampe. Circumcision was the removal of an offending portion of the human body, the sanitary purpose of which rite was strenuously believed in, but it was a partial cleansing and actual excision of one member of the body. To accomplish this purpose Moses, by his enactment, regarded even the sabbatic law as subsidiary. Why, then are the Jews wrathful with Jesus for making an entire man - a whole physical frame - healthful on the sabbath? The stress laid on the Authorized Version and R.T. translations, "every whit whole," by some commentaries is unfortunate; for it would throw discredit on circumcision altogether, which was far from our Lord's contention here, and would reduce the force of his argument. Christ does not in this argument take up the great line of defence pursued in ch. 5. Nor does he call the healing of the paralytic more than an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a "work;" but it must be remembered that he had spoken on the previous occasion of his great miracles as "works," the like to which he saw the Father ever doing.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit we know this Man whence he is</span>; that is, they knew his parentage, the place of his early life, the father, mother, brothers, and sisters (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55, 58</a>). There was none of the mystery about him which they anticipated for their Messiah. It is even intimated that it was known where he was born (vers. 41, 42), and that the Christ would be born in Bethlehem, so that the mere fact of birthplace is not the difficulty that occurred to them. A tradition had gathered, which was perhaps originated by <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> or <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, that he would make a sudden descent on the temple - a dazzling appearance at his Messianic enthronization, coming in the clouds of heaven, and that none would "declare his generation." So, according to 'Sanh.,' 97, a, "three things are wholly unexpected - Messiah, a god-send, and a scorpion" (cf. 'Mid. on Cantic. 2:9'). Justin Martyr puts into the lips of Trypho, 'Dial.,' 8, "But Christ - if he has indeed been born, and exists anywhere - is unknown, and does not even know himself, and has no power until Elias come to anoint him and make him manifest to all." So these Jerusalemites said, <span class="cmt_word">When the Christ cometh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> makes his Christwise manifestation - is in act of coming), <span class="cmt_word">no one knoweth whence he is.</span> This Messianic manifestation has been tardy and gradual, if it be one at all We know the home, the daily upbringing of Jesus - we know whence he is, or think we do; and so the whole affair clashes with a current expectation. We know enough, too much, of this Jesus for it to be possible for him to fill up this portion of the Messianic programme. This may have been the outcome of the general criticism. Other defects, according to their idea, may have been urged. The many-sidedness of the hope, the vagueness of the dream, as it shaped itself in current Jewish thought, suffered almost any amount of doubt as to the exact form of the approaching manifestation. That to which our Lord especially replied revealed the practical and ethical claim he advanced to their acceptance from himself of the word of the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a></div><div class="verse">Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore cried</span> - lifted up his voice in such a way as to cause wide astonishment. (The word is found in <a href="../../par/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a> of John the Baptist, and ver. 37 and <a href="../../par/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44</a>; but frequently in the synoptists and Acts, and very frequently in the LXX.) The trumpet peal sounded through the courts of the temple, and the crowds rushed in the direction from which it proceeded. He cried <span class="cmt_word">in the temple</span>. This clause is added, notwithstanding the statement of ver. 14, and it intimates a break in the discourse, a sudden and trenchant response to certain loudly uttered murmurs of the Jerusalem multitude. <span class="cmt_word">Ye both know me, and know whence I am.</span> Surely (with De Wette, Meyer, Westcott, Moulton) the Lord distinctly concedes to the men of Jerusalem a certain amount of superficial knowledge. It is lamentably defective in respect of that for which they imagine it all-sufficient; and yet this knowledge was highly significant and important as far as it went. Such knowledge of his birthplace and his family, his provincial training, his Galilaean ministry, were all proofs to them of his <span class="accented">humanity</span> - that he belonged to their race,  was bone of their bone, and sympathizing in their deepest sorrows, understood their noblest aspirations. Such a concession, moreover, repudiates the supposed docetic character of the Christ of the Fourth Gospel. Many commentators regard the exclamation its ironical and interrogatory (Grotius, Lampe, Calvin, Lucke, and even Godet), without sufficient warrant. Our Lord, however, soon shows that, though they are rightly informed about certain obvious facts, there were others of stupendous importance which could go a long way towards rcconciling their many-sided and conflicting ideas of Messiah, of which they were yet in ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">And yet</span> (all commentators show that there is a certain adversative force about this third <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>; see also ver. 30; <a href="../../par/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-30.htm">John 9:30</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-12.htm">Mark 12:12</a>) <span class="cmt_word">I am not come from myself (</span>see <a href="../../par/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>). I have not risen upon the wings of my own ambition. It is not my mere human whim and purpose, or my desire for self-glorification, which brings me before you. You may know the home of my childhood; and watched as I have been by your eager spies, as you had full right to do, you may know all my public proceedings, and yet you have not fathomed the fact that I have not come on my own errand, nor does my humanity as you have grasped it cover the whole of the facts about me. There is a peculiarity, a uniqueness, about my coming that you have yet to learn. I have been <span class="accented">sent</span> to you; <span class="cmt_word">but he that sent me is real</span> - a reality to me, which makes it an absolute reality in itself. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is somewhat peculiar, and, unless with some commentators and Revisers we make it equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and thus disturb the uniform usage of St. John, we must either imagine under the word a real "Sender," or one really answering to the idea already announced as of <span class="accented">One</span> competent to send. "He that sent me, the Father," of whom I spoke (<a href="../../par/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>) when last we conversed together, is the overwhelming Reality in this case. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye know not.</span> The Jerusalem multitudes were suffering grievously from the superstitious limitations of their own faith, from the traditions, the symbolism, the letter, the form, which had well nigh strangled, suffocated, the underlying truths. They had in many ways lost the God whose great Name they honoured. They failed to apprehend his awful nearness to them, his love to every man, his compassion to the world, the demand of his righteousness, the condition of seeing him, the way to his rest - "<span class="accented">Him ye know not."</span> This was a serious rebuke of the entire system which prevailed at Jerusalem. Not understanding nor knowing the <span class="accented">Father</span>, they were unable to see the possibility of his having sent to them, through the life and lips of a Man whom they knew, his last and greatest message.

If this knowledge should break as the daystar on their darkness, would they not at once see that, up to that point at least, in their experience they did not know, or had not known, whence he was, in the grandest sense. The charge of ignorance and the claim of supernatural knowledge, Divine origin, Divine commission, was too much for these Jerusalemites. They thought it blasphemy.

There were political considerations, there were lingering and coruscating fires of enthusiasm burning in the hearts of those who had seen his great works; and probably an awe, a superstitious fear, of some stroke of his reputed power held them back. The evangelist once more notices the true cause of this arrest of their malignity: "The hour" for the termination of his self-revelation, for the completion of his self-surrender, the hour which to the beloved disciple's eye was the very consummation of the ages, had not struck.

They expected Messiah to give proof of his Divine commission (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4, 5, 20-25</a>). Has not Jesus satisfied all reasonable claims? The question was like fire in touchwood. A conflagration might at any moment burst from the excitable throng which no decision of the Sanhedrin could repress. Something must at once be done to allay the excitement. In the crowd which was pressing the claims of Jesus were many Pharisees, an immensely larger element in the population than the chief priests, and therefore more likely at once to bring such information to the central religious authority.

The "chief priests" - a phrase often occurring in the writings of Luke, and here for the first time in this Gospel - cannot be confined to the official "high priest," but may include the ex-high priests, perhaps the heads of the twenty-four courses of priests and the chiefs of the priestly party, though there is no proof of it. The Pharisees and priests were often at enmity, but there were several occasions during our Lord's ministry when they combined against a common foe. The Pharisees had been his most steady opponents in Galilee. The eighth and ninth chapters of Matthew, with parallel passages, reveal the growing animosity of their demeanour, and their disposition to misunderstand, to oppose, and to crush every great self-revelation made by him. Their chiefs were in Jerusalem, and doubtless formed a powerful element in the great council. The formality of this session of the council may be reasonably questioned. There had been orders then for the arrest, which they had only to put at any time, if they dared, into immediate operation.

Moments, catastrophes, did arrive in their tragic history when they had passionately desired, but in vain, to see one of the days of the Son of man.

The Dispcrsion (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) may mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jewish dispersion among the Greeks beyond the limits of Palestine (2 Macc. 1:27). It is also found in Josephus for the outcast of Israel (see LXX. <a href="../../par/psalms/146-2.htm">Psalm 146:2</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>). There was a wide "dispersion" in Babylon and Syria, throughout Persia, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Cyprus, even in Achaia, Macedonia, and Italy. The Dispersion was the Greater Israel. Most intimate relations subsisted between these scattered Israelites and their political and ecclesiastical centre in the metropolis. Often those at the greatest distance front the temple were the most passionately loyal and patriotic. But for the Messiah to commence a prophetic career among <span class="accented">them</span>, after having been repudiated by the great council of the nation, was a bitter sarcasm. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the "Dispersion" may refer to the wide scattering of the Greeks themselves, the natural antithesis to God's covenanted people. Now <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is certainly a very awkward and unique rendering of the genitive, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> applies the "dispersion" in a peculiar sense not elsewhere used. Alford says the word means the land where the Jews are scattered. Still, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> appears to me a fair rendering of the words, especially as it is followed by "and teach the Greeks." Nothing could more adequately express the utter scorn of the Jewish mind for a pseudo-Messiah who, failing with his own people, and here in the courts of the Lord's house, would turn to the Gentiles. Such a bare supposition would bring utter discomfiture, as they thought, upon his claims. What a forecast they made in their malicious suggestions! Long before John reported this speech he himself had taken up his seat in Ephesus. In all the great cities of the empire it was avowed on both sides that "in Christ Jesus there was neither Jew nor Greek." Had not Jesus already given indication of this laxity as to the privileges of Israel: "Many shall come," etc. (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>)? Had he not referred to the ministry of Elijah and Elisha severally to the Syro-Phoenician and the Syrian (<a href="../../par/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25-27</a>)? Had he not shown culpable leniency to the hated Samaritan? Surely they meant to suggest the uttermost treason to the traditions of Israel, when they thus chose to put a meaning into his words. Like Caiaphas  in <a href="../../par/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-51</a>, they said and prophesied more than they knew. Archdeacon Watkins says, "The irony of history is seen in the fact that the very words of these Jews of Palestine are recorded in Greek, by a Jew of Palestine, presiding over a Christian Church in a Gentile city."

Both here and in ver. 45 we see that the evangelist had access to the ideas and converse of the "Jews," which proves that he had special sources of information to which the ordinary synoptic tradition was strange. The thought grows upon one that John was more than the mere fisherman of the lake. He was a friend of Nicodemus, and known to Caiaphas. It is clear that some further time elapses. This conversation, of which we have the prominent items, the chief utterances, was producing its effect upon the two-sided multitude, upon "the Jews," the "Pharisees," the city party, the chief priests. The Lord probably retired once more to the house of Lazarus or of John.

The question cannot be finally answered. The Feast of Tabernacles, according to <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>, is said to last seven days; and, so far as the Mosaic ceremonial goes, the ceremonial of the seventh day was less imposing and festive than either of the preceding days. But <a href="../../par/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a> shows that the eighth day was also celebrated as a solemn assembly, on which no servile work could be done (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>). In 2 Macc. 10:6 eight days of the feast were spoken cf. On the day of holy convocation the people removed or left their booths, and thus commemorated, with great rejoicing, the close of the wilderness period and the commencement of their national history. It may, moreover, have been called "the great day" because it was the closing day of all the festivals of the year. Josephus calls it "the very sacred close (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the year." The LXX. gives the curious translation <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, for <span class="accented">azereth</span>, equivalent to "assembly." This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> Philo ('De Septenaris') describes as the end of the festivals of the sacred year. Meyer, Alford, Godet, Lange, and many others regard the eighth day as that here referred to by the word "great," and find, in the very absence of the ceremonial of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, the occasion which provoked the reference of our Lord to his own power to meet the spiritual thirst of mankind, thus repeating what he had said to the woman of Samaria of his own grace, with further and nobler expansions. The songs which had been sung on every previous day of the feast were sung without the special rejoicings and water ceremonial. Hence some have thought that the very contrast between the previous days and this last day, "great" in other respects, may have made the reference quite as impressive as if the following words had been spoken in some pause, or at the conclusion of the great Hallel of the seventh day. So Westcott. It should, however, be noted that Rabbi Juda (in the Genesisara on 'Succah') asserts that the water pouring took place on the eighth day as well. This is supposed, by Lange, to be inaccurate or a later addition. Edersheim, however, has given strong reasons for believing that very special ceremonial took place on the <span class="accented">seventh</span> day. The people, all carrying in both hands their palm, myrtle, and citron branches, divided into three companies, one of which waited in the temple, one went to Moya to fetch willow branches to adorn the altar, and a third repaired with music to the Pool of Siloam, where the priest filled his golden goblet with water, and returned, with blast of trumpet, by the water gate, to the court of the priests. There he was joined by other priests with vessels of wine. The water was poured into the silver funnel, and at this act burst forth the great Hallel (<a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>) in responsive chorus. The people shook their palm branches as they sang the words, "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord." On the last day, the great day of the feast, the priests compassed the altar seven times before the sacrifices were kindled, and the songs accompanying the ceremony of this day were called "the great Hosanna." As the people left the temple they shook off their willow leaves on the altar, and beat their palm branches to pieces. Edersheim thinks that it was at the moment when the pause after the great Hallel occurred that Jesus lifted up his voice, and there is much probability in the suggestion. Alford, accepting the <span class="accented">non</span>-pouring of the water on the eighth day, considers that the very absence of  that ceremonial provided the opportunity for the great utterance which follows. Chrysostom says, on the eighth day, "when they were returning home, he g - adopting an unusual attitude of command, and unaccustomed energy of voice (<a href="../../par/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35</a> and ver. 28, note) ? <span class="cmt_word">If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</span> Christ thus identifies himself with the deepest meaning of the Old Testament and the Hebrew ritual. The sabbath and the temple found the highest expression of their meaning in his life and work. Godet thinks that the underlying reference here was to that of which the ceremonial was a memorial, and pointed to the smiting of the rock in the wilderness, from whose hidden depths the rushing waters flowed. The cry, "If any man thirst," might certainly recall the terrible drought in the wilderness, though there does not seem to me any definite reference to it in what follows. The libation of water was certainly not offered to the multitudes to drink, but the ritual use of water treats it as an dement absolutely essential to our human life. The people gave thanks that they had reached a land where fell the early and latter rain, and fountains and wells and springs of living water ran. Christ offered more than all - the utter final quenching of all torturing thirst. The people sang <a href="../../par/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." He said, "Come to me," and your joy shall be full. To the woman at the well he had said that the water he would give should be in the soul as a well of water springing up into eternal life. but in this connection he promised a much more precious gift. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a></div><div class="verse">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on me.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the nominative absolute, followed by another construction, gives great force to the mighty words. This is not the first time that Christ has represented believing under the form of both "coming" and "drinking." The one term seems to cover that part of faith in Christ which unites the soul to him, which sides with him, which utterly abandons self to take his word as true and his power as sufficient; the other term, when applied to participation in his blood, implies receiving into the soul the full solace of his imparted life. <span class="accented">He that believeth on me, <span class="cmt_word"></span>as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall rush torrents of living water.</span> From his newly given, divinely imparted life shall proceed, as from the innermost depths of his consciousness, illimitable supplies of refreshment and fertility for others as well. Each soul will be a rock smitten in the thirsty land, from which crystal rivers of life-giving grace shall flow. Godet urges, against Meyer, the great sufficiency of this particular illustration of the rock in the wilderness as justifying the reference to the phrase, "as the Scripture hath said," and points especially to <a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, "Behold, I will stand before thee there...  in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and out of it (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) water shall come, that the people may drink" (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/114-8.htm">Psalm 114:8</a>; passages read during the feast). He thinks the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;</span> corresponds with "from out of it" of Exodus. Hengstenberg laid long and fantastic emphasis on the <span class="accented">Canticles</span>,where the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the bride of Jehovah is described. It is certain that the numerous passages in the Old Testament, in which the gift of refreshing water is made the symbol of national mercies and spiritual blessings, do, for the most part, fall short of this remarkable expression. Still, <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>, all more or less approach the thought; but <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>, where from the altar the living, health giving, mighty river flows for the healing of the nations, is so akin to the saying of the Lord, as soon as we recognize the fact that he is greater than the temple, and that his Church is God's temple, and each body of man a temple of the Holy Ghost, that all real difficulty vanishes. The whole history of the Church is one continuous comment and illustration of the exhaustless fulness of his Word. Just as a soul of man comes and drinks of the water of life, he becomes himself a perennial source of life to others. He supplies not cisterns of stagnant water, but rivers of living water (<a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). Chrysostom adds, "One may perceive what is meant, if he will consider the wisdom of Stephen, the tongue of Peter, the vehemence of Paul; how nothing withstood them - not the anger of multitudes, nor the uprising of tyrants, nor plots of devils, nor daily deaths - but, as rivers borne along with loud rushing sound, they went on their way." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a></div><div class="verse">(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given</i>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This spake he,</span> <span class="cmt_word">said the evangelist, concerning the Spirit, which they that believe</span> <span class="cmt_word">on</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span> <span class="cmt_word">were to receive: for the</span> (Holy) <span class="cmt_word">Spirit</span> <span class="cmt_word">was</span> <span class="cmt_word">not yet</span> (given), <span class="cmt_word">because </span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> This verse has a great weight, as the evangelist's interpretation of the previous words of the Lord, nor can they be put aside. The history of the outpouring of the Spirit on Pentecost, and the mighty gift of the risen and glorified Jesus to those who believed on him, are their abundant justification. If the thirty-eighth verse were not an immense advance upon the promise of the thirty-seventh verse, it would not be easy to show how the words of the first promise could only find fulfilment in a future and as yet unrealized condition. Eternal life is a present gift. Satisfaction of the thirst of the soul was an immediate bestowment of Christ, and had been realized by untold multitudes of those who had been inwardly cleansed by the Spirit, who had come to the waters of life, who had received the Logos, and known that they were sons of God. But the thirty-eighth verse speaks of a new and nobler life flowing to others from belief in Christ. It looks forward to the production of a worldwide blessing conditioned by what was yet to happen. So that we cannot doubt that John saw more deeply into the Lord's words than some of those who have criticized his comment. John, says Weiss, does "not mean to explain the metaphor of the living water, but he intends to prove the truth of Jesus' promise from his own blessed experience." "<span class="accented">The</span> (<span class="accented">Holy</span>) <span class="accented">Spirit was not yet"</span> is, however, a strange and startling statement. The work and Person of the Spirit are spoken of throughout the Old Testament - from <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="../../par/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; to <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>. The redeeming and renewing, quickening powers of the Spirit are represented as equipping judges, artists, warriors, and prophets for their work, as sanctifying the individual soul (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24, 27</a>), and building the temple of God (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>). The prophetic gift is especially referred to the Spirit by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). More than this, our Lord himself is, in the synoptic Gospels, said to be conceived by the Holy Spirit, and his humanity baptized and anointed, empowered and directed throughout by the Spirit, and kept by him in sacred consecration and personal union with the Logos. The union of the Divine and human nature of Christ is maintained by that same Spirit who is the union of the Father and of the Son. In what sense can it be said, "the Holy Spirit was not yet"? Our Lord himself has thrown most light upon this perplexing saying when, on promising the Paraclete, he said, "He shall not speak of [or, 'from'] himself: he will take of mine, and show unto you" (<a href="../../par/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14</a>); and when he declared (<a href="../../par/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7-10</a>) that he must himself go to the Father, resume his antenatal glory, carry our nature, dishonoured by man, but now clothed with an infinite majesty, to the very throne of God, as the condition of the gift of the Paraclete. There was, in the constitution of nature, in the order of providence, in the revelations of the prophets, in the Person of the Son of man, that wherewith the blessed Spirit was ever and ceaselessly working; but not until the atonement was made, till God had glorified his Son Jesus, not until the Person of the God-Man was constituted in its infinity of power and perfection of sympathy, were the facts ready, were the truths liberated for the salvation of men, were the streams of living water ready to flow from every heart that received the Divine gift. In comparison with all previous manifestation of the Spirit, this was so wonderful that John could say of all that had gone before - "<span class="accented">not yet,"</span> "<span class="accented">not yet."</span> The Baptist's expression, "I knew him not" (see note, <a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>), and the scene described in <a href="../../par/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21, 22</a>, do not contradict this (see note). This is the first time that John mentions the glorification of the Son of mart. Jesus certainly looked at his death, with what followed it, as his glory (see <a href="../../par/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>, etc.; John 13:31; 17:5). This evangelist does not, so clearly as St. Paul (says Westcott), discriminate the two stages of "humiliation" and "glory" (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a> with <a href="../../par/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>).

This was one of the  grand features of the Old Testament conception of the Coming One. Whether even the wisest of them had learned to combine all these features of Prophet, Priest, and King, of Shiloh, of the Branch of the Lord, of the Lamb of God, and Prince of Peace, into one individual, is open to doubt. They might believe that their eyes saw much, and yet wait for more (cf. John the Baptist's message from the prison).

The people are resting on the letter of prophecy (<a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), where the Messiah, as understood by their own teachers (see <a href="../../par/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5</a>), was to proceed from Bethlehem; but they overlook the remarkable prediction in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>, where Galilee is spoken of as the scene of extraordinary illumination.

"Hilgenfeld candidly owns that this passage assumes the author's knowledge of this very fact" (Godet). It was unknown to the multitude, who were not at that moment aware how this argument would ultimately be pressed by the first preachers of the gospel. John leaves the objection unanswered, because he knew that all his readers, familiar with the synoptic narrative, would answer it for themselves. As respects the well known belief current in John's later years, and confirmed by the ecclesiastical tradition of Hegesippus (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 3:19, 20), that the relatives of Jesus were summoned, as descendants of David, into the Emperor Domitian's presence, it is clear that Jesus was believed to be the humble heir of David's throne and family, so that his readers would see that he fulfilled not only the prophecy of <a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, but those of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, passages which anticipate the Messiah's descent from David. These were minor points in the great <span class="accented">tableau</span> of John's Gospel. He who believed with overwhelming conviction that Jesus was the Logos made flesh, the Son of God, and the risen and glorified Lord, bestowing the Spirit of his own wondrous Person upon his Church, would not trouble much about these mistakes of the people concerning the ancillary details of his earthly career which, when he wrote, had become universally known. It was, however, instructive, half a century later, to see how flimsy, unveracious, and worthless the objections were which passed from lip to lip at this crisis in the life of our Lord. A Greek of the time of Hadrian would be surely very unlikely to have represented this condition of the Jerusalem mind. Now, some of those who believed that he was a great Prophet, the predicted Prophet, yet refused to agree with others who hailed him as the Christ. The division or violent party split (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) in the crowd on that "last great day of the feast" may have had persons friendly to him on both sides; but on one side at least there were those who were ready to side with Pharisees and "Jews" and lay hands upon him.

"His hour was not yet come." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-45.htm">John 7:45</a></div><div class="verse">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - In ver. 32 we learn that Pharisees and chief priests had sent "officers" to lay hands on him, to seize their opportunity for an arrest; but, sharing somewhat the outburst of enthusiasm which wavered between his claims to be the Prophet or the Christ, and only subsided for a moment on a miserable and unveracious plea, they did not dare to execute the command of their masters. <span class="cmt_word">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees (</span>the absence of the article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> shows that they were regarded as one body, who had charged these officers to undertake the duty in which they signally failed); <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">they</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, the latter) <span class="cmt_word">said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to them, Why did ye not bring him?</span> Foiled in their intention to carry out the order of the committee  of the council, they return empty handed, and to some extent baffled and chagrined.

They had heard the shouts which hailed him as the great Prophet, nay, as Messiah himself, and their reply, according to the curtailed text, was, <span class="cmt_word">Never</span> <span class="cmt_word">man so spake.</span> It matters little whether the additional clause, "as this Man speaks," was in the original text or not, the idea is the same; and it confirms the supposition to which we have often referred - that John only gives us the great sentences which the Divine Lord made the text of a discourse. An overwhelming impression was produced that the Speaker had a deep secret to disclose, vast treasure to bestow, unlimited power to meet the thirst of man, and even to make those who utterly yield to his influence the fountains of benedictions to others. An awe as of unseen things fell on the officers and the people. They could not resist the sense of benediction which, like some sacred perfume, some supernatural glamour, fell upon them in his reval words. "Never man thus spake." The whole experience is new and wonderful. "These sayings of the Prophet of Nazareth are more than words; they have living powers; they have confounded and disarmed us<span class="accented">."</span>

There is, however, a touch of weakness in the question. They seem to say, if one of the rulers, one of the Pharisees, had taken a different course, there might be some colour for the pusillanimity of the officers. The question which they put, thus expecting a negative answer, might be answered differently. There <span class="accented">were</span> Pharisees who had shown some sympathy with Jesus. Certain steps, moreover, taken by him were not so hopelessly hostile to their own views. In their momentary animosity, blinded by passion, they are ready to ignore this and other facts as well. Some of the higher classes in Galilee had already admitted his claims (see <a href="../../par/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>, etc.). The language of the Pharisees has been a stock objection to every great spiritual movement in its beginning. The writer thus reveals a knowledge of proceedings to which he must have had some exceptional means of access. The obvious familiarity which he suggests with Nicodemus and with friends in the high priest's palace (ch. 18:15) is the simplest explanation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a></div><div class="verse">But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this multitude, which knoweth not the Law,</span> are <span class="cmt_word">accursed.</span> This is a most contemptuous expression - <span class="accented">am-ha-'arez</span>, equivalent to "this scum of the earth," "the unlettered rabble." The Pharisees were accustomed to show sovereign contempt for those who had no admission to their own culture and methods of knowledge. Edersheim and Wunsche quote 'Pes.,' 49, <span class="accented">b</span>; 'Baba,' B. 8, <span class="accented">b</span>; and 'Chetub.,' 3:6 in proof of the utter inhumanity of their judgments. This language did not endorse a formal excommunication of the multitude - a supposition in its own nature impossible and absurd - but it expressed the brusque and harsh contempt with which the Pharisees then present wished to correct the weak compliance of their own servants. Lange presses the utterance too far. We cannot see in it more than the bitter outburst of their pent-up spite. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50</a></div><div class="verse">Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50, 51.</span> - They were hardly prepared for what followed; for one of their own order, one of their "rulers," "the teacher of Israel," a chief among the Pharisees, opens his lips to speak to them, and to call for a halt in their rash proceedings. He did not go far, but he directed attention to a fundamental principle of that very "Law" which the Pharisaic party were ignoring. <span class="cmt_word">Nicodemus saith to them (he who came</span> to him <span class="cmt_word">formerly,</span> although <span class="cmt_word">being one</span> of them). The   parenthesis shows the author's strong recollection of the scene (<a href="../../par/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>, etc.), when the Lord had opened to his own mind, as well as to Nicodemus, the mystery of the kingdom, and the need of that very Spirit's power to which (John knew when he wrote that) the Lord was referring in his great discourse. Nicodemus had not proclaimed his own discipleship, but he meant to cover and shield the enthusiastic crowd from the sting of the cruel condemnation of this Pharisaic junta. <span class="cmt_word">Doth our Law judge</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">man</span> <span class="cmt_word">except it have first heard from himself, and have come to know what he doeth?</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a> margin, "Thou shalt not receive a false report;" <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>, "Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother"). The Law is here personified in the person of the judge. The process is not followed by this hasty <span class="accented">ex parte</span> statement. The Law is traversed by this forgetfulness of the first principle of justice as between man and man. They might have rejoined that they <span class="accented">did</span> know the teaching and the work of Jesus. They had been following him by their representatives, and were now witnesses of his extraordinary assumptions, and had evidence enough on which to proceed. The retort which they made is sufficient proof of the defective and passion-blinded method of their own procedure. Moreover, it shows that the prophetic rank assigned to the Lord Jesus was the main question in the mind of Nicodemus and his Pharisaic companions. The rules for the judgment of a prophet were stringent, and no attempt had been made to put these prophetic claims to the test (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19-22</a>). Moreover, they ran off upon an utterly false tack, and were not free from inaccuracy in their solemn appeal to Holy Scripture.

The prophetic order can scarcely be thought to have been recruited from the northern province. Even Hosea had his origin in Samaria. Amos was an inhabitant of Tekoah; twelve miles south of Jerusalem. Nahum the El-koshite cannot be proved to have sprung from the Galilaean town of Elkosh; though it is not impossible, it is at least probable, that Elkosh in Assyria, on the Tigris, two miles north of Mosul and south of Nineveh, was the place whence Nahum and his prophecies issued. Elijah the Tishbite, of the land of Gilead, cannot be claimed as a Gallilaean. The case is different with reference to Jonah of Gath-Hepher, of the tribe of Zebulon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), who, as a solitary and by no means morally impressive character, might almost as an exception prove the truth of the general statement. The historical error is far from difficult to account for in the stress of the discontent which these Pharisees were now manifesting towards everything Galilaean. Godet, on the authority of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, being the text, would have it that "there has not now arisen in the Person of Jesus a Prophet." Baumlein presses this still further, by making the "prophet" mean "the Messiah." There is no reasonable ground for charging on these Pharisees "an incredible ignorance or incomprehensible misunderstanding." Such a charge is more like one of the incomprehensible misunderstandings of the modern critical school whenever a chance opens of assailing the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel.

There is some ground for the deviation. The scenes of the previous day had been broken up into various groups. The favouring crowd from the provinces sympathized with a portion of the Jerusalem populace; then the hostile crowd at the beck of the authorities had been checked by the "officers" who had been themselves baffled and thunderstruck with the dignity and claims of Jesus. Great excitement had prevailed, and before the stormy scenes and recriminations of the previous day recommenced, the whole temple throng came unto him. If the eighth day of the feast was referred to - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if the great day of the feast were the eighth day - the difficulty of the whole people having gathered about him is diminished, because there were special gatherings for the eighth day (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>). It might have seemed that they had composed their differences, and were now waiting some symptom and signal of the great Leader's will. [<span class="cmt_word">And he sat down, and was teaching</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>.] This expression is synoptic rather than Johanninc; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it belongs to the methods of the Galilaean ministry (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-35.htm">Mark 9:35</a>) rather than to the hostile encounters of the metropolis (but see <a href="../../par/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a>). He was prepared for long discourse and various instruction. Here, as in <a href="../../par/john/7-14.htm">John 7:14</a>, the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> is used  without specifying the topic or theme on which he dwelt. The calm morning was soon overclouded, and the people violently excited, by a very ominous disturbance, planned with subtle care and malicious intention on the part of the authorities, who were ready at all costs and by any device to break the spell which Jesus was exerting over some of the people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the scribes and Pharisees are bringing</span> - dragging by main force - (<span class="cmt_word">to</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span>) a woman taken in <span class="cmt_word">adultery;</span> <span class="cmt_word">and, having caused her</span> - forced her, notwithstanding the hideous shame of her discovery - <span class="cmt_word">to stand in the midst, they say unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Master</span>. The "scribes" are not elsewhere referred to in John's Gospel, although the phrase, "scribes and Pharisees," is very frequently used in the synoptic Gospels for the opponents of our Lord and the subjects of his invective. They come together in the final scenes as combining to thwart and tempt him. John refers to "Pharisees" twenty times, and four times in connection with the "priests;" but never with the "scribes." The scribes are elsewhere in the New Testament spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and also as "rabbis" in the Mishna. The scribes and Pharisees are no deputation from the Sanhedrin, nor are they representatives of the party of Zealots, as some have pretended. There is no indication of any mere sectional animosity or of any genuine desire to receive an authoritative or prophetic response to their inquiry. The Sanhedrin itself would certainly not have condescended at this epoch to have submitted any question of its own action to the arbitrament of Jesus. Numerous witnesses of the act of adultery are inconceivable, though in the excitement and confusion of the Feast of Tabernacles in a crowded city and suburbs, this may have been more feasible than might otherwise be supposed. The probability is that the act was undeniably committed in such a way as to bring this woman under the cognizance of these reformers or defenders of the theocracy who cropped up on all sides, and that a group of bigots scow at once that capital might be made for their antagonism to Jesus by proposing to him a query which would, however it might  be answered, lower his prestige. According to ver. 10 (omitted in Codex B), these scribes and Pharisees were, if not the "witnesses" of adultery, the "accusers" ready to take the case before the highest court. Considering the long desuetude of the Law, and the impossibility of even the Sanhedrin legally inflicting the penalty of stoning, even if it were so disposed, the whole question looks like a subtle but ill-considered plot to entangle the Lord in his judgments, and to induce him to sacrifice his influence with the people. The absence of the guilty <span class="accented">man</span> is noteworthy (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>).

For ordinary adultery the death penalty is left indefinite (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). It is no proof that strangulation was the method of punishment in the days of our Lord because the Talmud and Maimonides thus express it. Meyer concludes that the woman was a <span class="accented">betrothed</span> bride. This offence is, broadly speaking. "adultery" of an aggravated kind. The reference to the method of the punishment is not demonstrable proof of this, because it would be easily feasible to transfer the method of the death from the extreme case to the ordinary ease of nuptial infidelity (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> for the punishment of unspecified death for sabbath violation (repeated <a href="../../par/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2</a>), interpreted of "stoning" in the special illustrative case, <a href="../../par/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>). This is Moses' Law - "<span class="accented">what sayest thou?"</span> This query involves an ascription to Jesus of the right of authoritatively interpreting the Law. thus attributing to him the functions of a new legislator. Some have objected to the bare possibility of such an appeal being made to Jesus by any species of Jewish authority. The whole context shows that the process was malicious, ironical, crafty. The entire audience knew that this law had never been accepted or applied literally; that the Sanhedrin had not enforced it; and that, if they had endeavoured to do so, the Roman power had taken from the nation the <span class="accented">jus gladii.</span> The question, therefore, became one of casuistry inflamed by a concrete case, and having as its ally a secret sympathy with the offenders. It was not uncommon for the rabbis to discuss the incidence of <span class="accented">obsolete</span> laws. Many of the glosses upon the ancient law, and laborious trifling with specific regulations of the so called oral law, turn upon customs that were absolutely impracticable under the new conditions of the Jewish life. This, however, was no mere quibble of words about possible duties. The query was put with dramatic force and in concrete form. The shame and life of a fellow creature were the materials which this eager and bloodthirsty group were utilizing for their vile purpose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-6.htm">John 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this they said tempting him, that they might have</span> (<span class="cmt_word">whereof</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to accuse him</span>. They sought a ground of formal accusation against Jesus. This implies some court before which the charge they desired to formulate it might be brought. The precise accusation is difficult to determine, and sundry distinguished scholars, Lucke, De Wette, and Alford, declare the problem or question insoluble. Augustine has been followed by a great body of expositors, who have supposed that an affirmative reply would have been inconsistent with the gentleness and mildness of our Lord's treatment of sinners, while a negative reply would at once have given them a charge to bring before the Sanhedrin of such a relaxation of the Law as would endanger his position as a Rabbi, still more as the Prophet like unto Moses. Almost all critics agree as to the use to which Christ's enemies were ready to put a <span class="accented">negative</span> reply, and therefore they coincide with Augustine in this part of his explanation. But the interpretation put upon the <span class="accented">affirmative</span> reply would not furnish the ground of any accusation before any court. An apparent inconsistency would be no civil charge, and would have no weight before any legal tribunal. The condemnation of adulterers to death by stoning would have been Christ's allowance of the letter of the Law to stand. The Romans could take no umbrage at this until the act had been carried into execution. It may probably have been known that, let the Sanhedrin record what verdict and punishment they pleased, the Roman magistrates would not have carried it into capital execution. How, then, could the scribes and Pharisees have carried an accusation or information before a Roman tribunal? The solution was  suggested by Baumgarten-Crusius and Luthardt, and adopted by Moulton, that Christ was asked to say "Aye" or "No" to an instant, tumultuous act of vengeance upon the adulteress. Let him say "No," they would accuse him of deliberately ignoring and repudiating the authority of the Law of Moses; let him say "Yes," they were ready to stone the woman there and then, and subsequently to throw the responsibility of such violation of Roman jurisdiction upon the Lord Jesus as its instigator. Meyer's objection, that no <span class="accented">question at all</span> had been put to Christ on this supposition, is not clear. It was this. Clearly apprehending that adultery is a capital offence, and that there was a case before them upon which no doubt could be thrown, they ask him, with the stones in their hands, "Shall we kill this damsel or not?" If he says "No," then they were prepared to denounce the Prophet for his dogmatic trifling with the Law; if "Yes," they are ready to do the deed, and fasten upon Jesus all the shame and guilt of the proceeding before the Roman governor. It was a very analogous problem to that concerning the tribute money recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus stooped down, and with his finger was writing on the ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, into the earth). Some manuscripts, E, G, and about ninety cursives, add, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "not troubling himself with them" - "as though he beard them not" (Authorized Version). This act is unparalleled in Scripture, even if the custom is still occasionally practised in the East. Mr. O'Neil, in his instructive volume, 'Palestine Explored,' records a curious instance of a youth, who, after playing some practical joke upon an old man, feigned utter ignorance of the surprise and cry of the old man by instantaneously assuming the position of one entirely abstracted from all sublunary thought, in fact, by sitting on the ground and scribbling with his finger in the dust, "as though he heard and saw nothing of what had happened." Such an intention can only be attributed to our Lord on the understanding that it was a current method of indicating an indisposition to have anything to say to the intruders. He was seated; he turned aside from the excited crowd, and by a significant symbol expressed his displeasure at their proceedings, and his perception of their craftiness. Conjecture has been busy, but vainly, with the inquiry as to what our Lord wrote on the ground, and some have urged (Godet) that he wrote the memorable sentence which follows, as a judge might write the verdict upon the case submitted to him. This is not probable, and it would detract from the symbolism of the act. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when they continued asking him; he lifted up</span> <span class="cmt_word">himself,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and said unto them, He that is without sin, let him first</span> c<span class="cmt_word">ast a stone at her.

Christ refused to act the part of the civil magistrate, or to countenance stormy outbreak of murderous passion against this flagrant sinner, to save himself from their bitter malice. He rose, when the appearance of indifference could not be maintained, and at once arrested the outbreak of their unscrupulous fury without presuming to repudiate the letter of the Law. He lifted the discussion from the judicial to the moral sphere. He does not mean that none but the sinless can condemn, or <span class="accented">pronounce verdict</span> upon the guilty; but he calls for special freedom from similar offence on the part of any man who should wish or dare to display his own purity by <span class="accented">taking part in the execution.</span> The narrative would not suggest that every one of these accusers had been in his time guilty of like offence, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must at least mean that he was free from the desires which might lead to the commission of such sin, and Christ calls for inward saintliness and freedom from all irregular propension. He calls for personal chastity as the only possible moral condition for precipitately <span class="accented">executing</span> this ancient and severe law. The question before the crowd (asked so craftily) was, not whether Moses' Law was to stand or not, but whether these particular men, with their foul hearts and spurious zeal, were or were not at that particular moment to encounter the displeasure of Roman power by dashing the stones at the head of this poor trembling creature of sin and shame; whether they were morally competent to condemn to immediate death, and carry the verdict into execution. Before this tremendous summons from the Holy One, conscience could sleep no longer. The hypocrisy of the entire manoeuvre stared them in the face.

The phrase expressing the action of conscience was probably an explanatory and true gloss, which accounted for the sudden change of front. It was a proof of the ally which Divine law has within the human breast. The whole crowd, rather than the humbled woman, is condemned, but self-condemned and silent. This event speaks for the moral sense which had been paralyzed rather than obliterated in this people. (The expression, "one by one," <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c2;</span>, in which <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c2;</span> is treated as indeclinable, is occasionally found in later Greek, but only once in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/mark/14-19.htm">Mark 14:19</a>), is not in D, but in several of the codices and cursives, and it is retained in R.T.) The slow rather than simultaneous disappearance of the gang of accusers is a highly dramatic touch, and the remaining clause, <span class="cmt_word">beginning from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the eldest, even unto the last,</span> heightens the impression. The phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> need not refer to office, but to age, and the "last" need not necessarily mean the youngest, but those that were left when the most responsible men found that they had carried their question too far, and had retired. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was left alone</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so far as these accusers were concerned. The multitudes who had gathered round him were still waiting for his words (see ver. 2). This fact is involved in the substance of the narrative, whether the <span class="accented">pericope</span> belongs to the Gospel of John or not. And <span class="cmt_word">the woman where she was,</span> <span class="cmt_word">in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the midst</span> of the assembly that remained, more likely cowering in shame and mortal fear than standing brazen-faced or daring before that awful Presence. These two ("Miseria et Misericordia," as said Augustine), "Misery and Pity," face one another, and in the presence of a multitude of disciples and other listeners, Misery waits for Pity to speak - for perfect holiness and perfect mercy to do its will. There is One seated there who <span class="accented">is</span> without sin. He is at liberty, on his own showing, to condemn, and even to execute his fierce displeasure against a sin which he had, in his great inaugural discourse, charged upon the ill-regulated desires and evil glances of men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-10.htm">John 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus lifted up himself,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and said to her, Where are they?</span> (<span class="accented">these</span> thy accusers). The question (with or without the additions) implied that our Lord had not seen the obvious effect of his words upon the accusing party. There was no triumph in his eye, no flush of victory over his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Hath no one condemned thee?</span> pronounced upon thee the sentence of condemnation? Has no one declared that thine is a case of stoning? - <span class="accented">No one?</span> Then the judgment has yet to be uttered, if it be left with him.

And he said</span> (<span class="cmt_word">to her</span>)<span class="cmt_word">, Neither do I condemn thee.</span> He had not come to condemn, but to save. A time is coming when the Father would commit all judgment into his hands - when his awful word, "I know you not," or "Depart from <span class="accented">me</span>," will be the signal of doom. But now his mission is to heal, not to wound; to comfort, not to punish; to reveal the heart of God, not to execute the crude judgments of men; to soothe, not to stone. He does not say, "Be of good courage; thy sins are forgiven." he does not say, "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; Her faith hath saved her;" but, <span class="cmt_word">Go, and henceforth sin no more.</span> He justifies the position that he will not quench the smoking flax nor break the bruised reed. He condemns the sin, but for a while spares the sinner. He refuses to set up his judgment against Moses, or take into his human hands the administration of civil or political law. He does not say, "Go in peace," or "Go to peace;" but from this moment, this awful "now" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), "sin no more." The reticence and abruptness of the narrator are not like the style of apocryphal writers. Such a narrative could not have been invented by the second-century disciples, by docetic Ebionites, by the ordinary fabricators  of apocryphal literature. If the text is so varied, conflicting, and ill-sustained as to envelop it in doubt; if the place in the gospel narrative be uncertain; if the use of a few words suggests a non-Johannine source; and if the position between <a href="../../par/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a> and John 8:12 be difficult to accept; - there is yet nothing inconsistent with the Johannine teaching, or the sublime and unapproachable originality of the character of the Johannine Christ. The narrative will remain for all time an illustration of the blending of judgment with mercy, which has received its highest expression in the life work and Person of the Christ.

If, however, the entire <span class="accented">pericope</span> is not in its correct place, we must link vers. 12-20 with the discourses of the previous chapter. On the great day of the feast, in obvious allusion to the mystic drawing of water in Siloam, and transference of it to the temple court, Jesus had said, "If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink." Many critics imagine that now he refers to the habit, on the first evening of the Feast of Tabernacles, and probably, though not surely, on the other evenings, of kindling the golden candelabra in the court of the women, giving the signal for a brilliant illumination which was visible over the city and surrounding hills. As the water was a symbolic memorial of the smiting of the rock, so the sudden blaze in the temple court was a similar reminder of the fiery pillar in the wilderness, and commentators have found in such ceremonial and memories an occasion for our Lord's words. Surely they go much deeper, and have a wider signification. The creation of light by the Word of the Lord, and St. John's own statement in the prologue that in the Logos was life, and the Life was the light, and the Light shone into the darkness before the Incarnation, is a more adequate interpretation. "The Word was made flesh," and this was the grand occasion for the revelation of the glory of God. "We beheld his glory," says the apostle, "that of an only begotten Son of the Father." The gospel narrative supplies the material which induced the evangelist to preface it with imposing words. The life of men produced by him who is Life lightens the world with its glory. He is the Light of the world, because he is the Source of its life. This inversion of the sequences belonging to modern science and even to Mosaic cosmogony, partly shows what is meant by "Light," and the Light of life. Life in the Johannine thought is Divine blessedness, the very essence of Divine activity and essential being. The Father hath it <span class="accented">in</span> himself, and he has given to the Son to be similarly self-complete. He can confer this life on others, communicating his own perfection to some of the creatures of his hand, even bestowing upon them some of the essential elements of his own being. There are varied emanations and forth-puttings of this life - vegetable, animal, psychical, spiritual - and in each case the life becomes a luminous source of direction, a self-revelatory force, <span class="accented">a light.</span> The highest Life of all is the brightest Light - the true Lamp of all our seeing (see ch. John 1:9 and John 11:9, 10). Jesus said, "<span class="accented">I am the Light of the world</span>," illuminating its darkness far more impressively than temple fireworks, or even pillars of radiant cloud, nay, more than the sunbeams themselves; and that because he was the Holder and Giver of <span class="accented">life. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the Light of the world.</span> The "again" may point back to the discourses of the previous chapter, or to the disturbance of the audience and the teaching of that early morning. If it were the morning of the departure of thousands from the holy city, peculiar appropriateness is felt in the continuation: <span class="cmt_word">He that followeth me shall not</span> (by any means) <span class="cmt_word">walk in the darkness</span> - shall not <span class="accented">start</span> off along the defiles of his pilgrimage in the murk of the night and the heavy hiding mists, <span class="cmt_word">but</span> he <span class="cmt_word">shall</span>, in my companionship, <span class="cmt_word">have the light of life.</span> My follower will see his way. Those who have entered into living fellowship with the living One awake from all death slumber and darkness, "walk in the light, as he is in the light;" "become light in the Lord;" "being made manifest are light;" being with the Lord become <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, torch bearers to the rest; and, more than all (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>), are themselves "the light of the world." The Messiah had been anticipated as "<span class="accented">Light</span>," as the Light of Gentiles as well as Jews (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>, where Simeon had caught the spirit of the ancient prophets). Edersheim (quoting 'Bemidb. R.,' 3 and 15, and 'Yalkut on <a href="../../par/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>): "The rabbis speak of the original light in which God had wrapped himself as in a garment, which was so brilliant that it could not shine by day because it would have dimmed the light of the sun. From this light that of sun, moon, and stars had  been kindled. It was now reserved under the throne of God for the Messiah, in whose days it would shine once more." (The Logos was, in the language of Philo, the Archetype and the Outflow of the light.) But the entire meaning of the manifestation of the Divine life in the Messiah is the diffusion of it in others. All Christ's teaching about himself has this practical and ethical bearing. The <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> - "will have," "will be in possession of," light - harmonizes with all the wonderful teaching which blends the Christ and his followers in one entity, "I in them, they in me," of ch. 15, 17; and Paul's "Christ formed in you," "Christ liveth in me" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-20.htm">Galatians 1:20</a>). "Light," says Augustine, "reveals other things and its own very self, opens healthy eyes, and is its own witness."

They were the nucleus of the bitter opposition to him current among the rulers in Jerusalem, and they reveal here a reminiscence of the discussion which had taken place in the temple or its neighbourhood after the healing of the impotent man (<a href="../../par/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31</a>, etc.). There the Lord had said that if he bore witness of himself, without any corroboration, his witness, thus isolated and deprived of evidence, would, on the ordinary grounds of a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> testimony, not be true; but be went on to say, further, that his testimony was variously corroborated by the manifest presence and cooperation of <span class="accented">the Father.</span> Forgetting thus his own vindication of himself - which many months of varied proof of his personality had confirmed for candid minds - they assail his comparison of himself to the Light of the world, with: <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">bearest witness of thyself; thy witness</span> - according to the canon he had himself admitted and supplemented; but they forgetting the supplement, add - (thy witness) <span class="cmt_word">is not true.</span> "If thou art simply making such exalted claims as this, in forgetfulness of the well known maxim about self-witness, we take the liberty to dispute and reject it."

He rather reasons and pleads with them. He suggests that they might, if they would, look below the surface of his flesh. Tim evangelist, who reports the substance of this discussion, has written. "The Word was made flesh." So if the incarnate Word had always been judged "after the flesh," we should never have seen his glory, nor recognized the  nobler part of his Personality. <span class="cmt_word">I judge no man</span>. Numerous efforts have been made to find the underlying modification of this assertion. Augustine, Chrysostom, Cyril, and many moderns add, "after the flesh," or "as you do" (the latter is the suggestion of Lucke, which, as Meyer says, comes to the same thing), or "now," pointing on to the actual assumption of his judiciary powers at the consummation of all things, and contrasting his earthly ministry of mercy with the ultimate majesty of his judgment throne (Westcott). Storr, Moulton, Godet. suggest "I by myself" - I alone, independently of the Father, judge no man. Meyer rejects all these attempts to add to the text, and maintains that our Lord is claiming the lofty position of Saviour rather than Judge. He came with that as his primary aim, purpose, intent; to heal, not to wound; to save, not to destroy; to give time for repentance, not to hurry sinners to their doom; to illumine, not to cover with darkness. Yet even Meyer admits a practical exception of great importance to be involved in the next clause, which does not differ from Westcott's interpretation.

The prince of this world is judged by the simple uplifting of the Son of God; and so, though he did not come to judge or condemn, yet judgments did, by the very necessity of his nature, proceed from him) <span class="cmt_word">even if I judge</span> - if by the mere contact of his purity and love and healing power with those who will not come to him for life, judgment is pronounced - <span class="cmt_word">my judgment is true;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> trustworthy. The reading of Tischendorf, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, would mean that it "answers to the fundamental conception of a judgment." This thought would make the apparent paradox of the sentence more difficult to resolve. <span class="cmt_word">Because I am net alone, but</span> (or, <span class="accented">because</span>, on the other hand) <span class="cmt_word">I and the Father who sent me</span>, together deliver this judgment; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it does not rest on my mere human consciousness, on what you who judge after the flesh might suppose it would rest, but on the eternal decisions of him who gave me my commission. The Father is in me and with me. I think the Father's thoughts and do the Father's will. Christ's testimony concerning himself, his implicit judgments on human nature, his indirect condemnation of the whole crowd, by his gracious refusal to condemn the sinful woman to immediate doom, all issue forth with the sign manual of Almighty God, with whom and in whom he dwells as the only begotten Son. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a></div><div class="verse">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Having laid down the principle on which he was justified in maintaining the truthfulness of the assumption which the Pharisees impugned, he proceeded to vindicate, for these Jewish legalists, its agreement with the very letter of the Law. He adopted here the identical ground which was taken by him when first of all he claimed this fellowship with the Father. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and in your Law it has been written,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that the witness of two men is true.</span> Many have said that here Jesus puts himself on one side as in hostility to the Law; Baur and some others plead, from the very phrase "your Law," that Jesus could not have used such an expression, and that John could not have recorded it; and Reuss urges that this expression agrees with the "standpoint of the gospel,which aims at lowering and degrading the old dispensation." Nothing could be less in harmony with the facts (see Introduction, &sect; VII. 2). Even Meyer says, "The words are anti-Judaic...  though not antinomian." Surely our Lord was simply appealing to his bitter enemies to recognize the application of the principle found in their own Law, of which they were continually making a proud boast. He simply goes to common ground of argument, and is ready to show that even the letter of the Law sustains his claim for the sufficient reason that he is not alone, but the Father is manifestly with him. Just as he never said "our Father" when addressing his disciples, but either "my Father" or "your Father" (<a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), because God is not the Father of men in the full sense in which he was Father to the only begotten Son; so he could not say "our Law" or "Moses gave us the Law" without derogating from the unique relation he sustained to the Law (compare Paul's language, <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17, 21, 23</a>). The quotation from Deuteronomy is not verbally exact; it even carries the statement of Scripture to a broader generalization, and is so worded that it applies to the case in point, by carrying the position to a legitimate consequence - "the witness of two <span class="accented">men</span> is <span class="accented">true."</span> By using the word "men," Christ suggests the contrast between two men on one side and the God-Man and the Father on the other. Lightfoot ('Horae Hebraicae') quotes 'Rosh-Shanah,' 1:2, 3,  "that two persons well known must testify to the supreme court that they had seen the new moon! If these were unknown persons, they must bring proof that they were credible witnesses." Upon these common principles of jurisprudence the Lord was willing, in purely Jewish fashion, to rest his claim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-18.htm">John 8:18</a></div><div class="verse">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the</span> (<span class="cmt_word">one</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that bears witness concerning myself</span> - I have said it, and abide by it, and I know what I say and how fully I am fulfilling these words - <span class="cmt_word">and the Father that sent me heareth witness concerning me</span>. His <span class="accented">words</span> reflected his own Divine self-consciousness. They bore one witness to his unique position. They brought out the inner thoughts of Christ, and revealed the life that was light. The word, the speech, of Christ was a fire kindled which would never be extinguished - it was the formal utterance of the eternal reality but it did not stand alone. The Father that sent him, by a long chain of events and revelations, by miracles and mighty energies, by the conference of the spirit of conviction upon the minds that gave candid attention to his verbal testimony, by the providential concurrence of facts with prophetic anticipation, was bearing witness concerning him. The argument is sufficient, so soon as we admit the terms used by Jesus, so soon as we recognize the ideas of the Son of God and of the Father, both alike revealed in the Person of Christ. We can understand, and to some extent sympathize with, the perplexity of the Pharisees. Later experiences have made it easier for us to understand the testimony of the Father, the presence and witness of God over and above the testimony of men and coincident with it (cf. <a href="../../par/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). All great spiritual revivals have given ample proof of the twofold testimony (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, where Paul, the writer of the Epistle, shows himself familiar with this "Johannine" thought; cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-19.htm">John 8:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said to him</span>, in angry, wilful irony, <span class="cmt_word">Where is thy Father? -</span> that he may bear to thee the witness which thou art appropriating. "Thou hast freed thyself from the charge of bearing unsupported testimony to thyself, by assuming the coordinate testimony of thy Father? Let thy Father manifest himself!" There is no need to explain this of the absence or insignificance of the earthly father of Jesus, or to suppose that they looked for some human attestation of such a kind (Augustine, Lange). They rather scoffed at his claim of unique relation to the Father, and asked with mockery," <span class="accented">Where is</span> he?" not "<span class="accented">Who</span> or <span class="accented">what</span> is he?" What proof has he given of any special relation to thee? <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span> this taunt with sublime patience and pity, with distress at the resolute and judicial blindness they were fastening upon themselves: <span class="cmt_word">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</span> Another stupendous utterance, implying the most intimate relation between his own personality and the Father's. Any fair or adequate knowledge of himself must reveal to them that he is in the Father and the Father in him; must bring forth to their consciences the overshadowing presence, the Divine glory. "You are wrapping yourself in impenetrable mists; you are refusing the light of life, and all the evidence given to you that I am the Light of the world. You do not see less recondite truths, nor perceive ideas far more elementary still; you cannot, in your spiritual blindness, apprehend the outline of my human character. If you had done this, you would have known my Father at least enough to prevent the utterance of so crude and disheartening a query. You know me not: why should I talk to you? All this ministry of mine has left me, so far as you Pharisees are concerned, perfectly unknown." There is awful severity and unutterable pathos in these closing words of the discourse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a></div><div class="verse">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-30.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Further controversy with different groups, ending in partial admission of his claims by some.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These words</span> - an expression which emphasized the foregoing interview, and shut it off from the following context - <span class="cmt_word">spake he</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the treasury, as he taught in the temple courts</span>.

If so, it was in the "court of the women," or the place of public assembly most abundantly frequented by the multitude, and beyond which the women could not penetrate into the "court of the priests." Edersheim disputes Westcott's suggestion, that the <span class="accented">gazith</span>, or session house of the Sanhedrin, was close by, and that the language of Jesus was within earshot of <span class="accented">them.</span> This chamber, <span class="accented">gazith</span>, was in the southeast corner of the "court of the priests," and therefore far away from the treasure chamber. Supposing that the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the treasury itself. the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> may point to the neighbourhood of the sacred enclosure. The reference shows that the locality even of the discourse had made profound impression on one of the disciples, and implies great publicity  and imminent peril from these bold avowals. The clause added by the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">And no man seized him; because his hour was not yet come,</span> is a phrase repeated frequently, and one which delays, by a strange refrain, the tragic consummation (see Introduction, &sect; VII. 5 (4)). Here it shows that some further attempt was made to lay violent hands on him, which for the moment failed. Seeing that avowals of his Divine nature wrought to a frenzy the passions of soma of his hearers, and finally led to his condemnation for a capital offence, the evangelist again and again shows that the Lord - who made these claims on his trial, as given in the synoptists - had frequently reiterated them at peril of his life. The language of the high priest shows how bitterly the ecclesiastical authorities resented this assumption. The Fourth Gospel makes the synoptic account of this matter more intelligible by showing us that it was not an isolated occurrence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This verse introduces a new scene and place, and perhaps a new day. The audience may have greatly changed, even if it had within it some of the same bewildered and exasperated enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Again</span> <span class="cmt_word">he said, therefore.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the fact that his liberty had not been infringed. The providence of God, the fear of the people, the inadequacy or confusing nature of the reports of his speech which had been taken to the authorities, had for a while arrested the tragedy. "No one laid hands on him." In consequence of this circumstance he said <span class="cmt_word">unto them again</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on a subsequent occasion), <span class="cmt_word">I go away, and ye shall seek me.</span> So much he had said before to "the Jews," adding, "Ye shall not find me" (<a href="../../par/john/7-34.htm">John 7:34</a>). Thus also he spake, later on, to the disciples, adding, "Thither ye cannot come" (<a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>). On all three occasions he was misunderstood. His departure was a mystery to the Jews, who thought, or at least said, that he, a pseudo-Messiah, might be contemplating a mission to the Greeks and to the Dispersion. His departure to the Father by a bloodstained pathway, by violent death, was unspeakably perplexing to his most intimate friends. The bare idea utterly conflicted with the current notion of the Christ; but it was in the last case (ch. 14.) modified by the promise that, though he was about to leave them and to return to his Father, yet he would come again - they should once more beheld him, and he would provide a place for them. Still, they would not be able for a while to follow him, even though willing to lay down their life for his sake (<a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>, etc.). But in the face of a more bitter misunderstanding and an utter inability to perceive and know either him or the Father, Christ said not only, "Ye shall seek me," <span class="cmt_word">but ye shall die in your sin</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> here indicates rather the condition in which they should die than the cause of their death. "In," not "of" (so Hengstenberg, Meyer, and Luthardt). He did not say, "perish by reason <span class="accented">of</span> this sin," but "die <span class="accented">in</span> this sin." They will die looking vaguely, hopelessly, for the Saviour whom they have, in such an hyperbole of spiritual dulness and of bitter malice alike, misunderstood and rejected. They will pass through the gate of death with no deliverance from sin secured. Knowing neither the Father nor the eternal life and light manifested in himself, they will seek and not find, they will die unsanctified, unatoned, unreconciled No gleam of light will play over the dark ness of the grave. <span class="cmt_word">Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> The eternal home of the Father's love will not open to such angry search. Such utter misunderstanding as they had evinced, such point blank refusal to walk in his light, will impede and block the way to the heart of the Father, whose perfect revelation and sufficient pleading they steadily resist. The language of this verse is probably the condensation and conclusion of s much longer debate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-22.htm">John 8:22</a></div><div class="verse">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore said</span> (were saying one to the other), <span class="cmt_word">Will he kill himself, that</span> (because) <span class="cmt_word">he saith, Whither I go, thither ye cannot come?</span> This query was one of harsh mockery, and can hardly be exaggerated in malign intent. The suicide was supposed to have his place in Gehenna, According to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:08. 5), "the darkest regions of Hades would receive the souls of such." The Jews then scoff at his departure as a spontaneous resort to a fate towards which they did rot care or mean to follow him. Edersheim declares this passage of Josephus not to be sustained by rabbinical authority, and he doubts this aspect of their scorn. He limits it to the Jewish guess that Jesus must be contemplating self. murder, and as putting deliberately such a distance between them and him that they could not traverse it. The very fact that they had it in their hearts to destroy him makes it probable that they were looking beyond the act of suicide, either to the hell of popular belief or the hatred of contemporaries. They obviously thought that none but a suicide can determine the time of his departure. Christ proceeded to show them that the reason why his death would separate them from him was a fundamental difference of nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - Yet this essential divergence is not based on fatalistic grounds, but on moral ones. The argument of the twenty-fourth verse explains the description of ver. 23. The ground of this utter alienation is the lack of belief, which will leave them in  their sins to die. <span class="cmt_word">He said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above.</span> You spring from the lower as opposed to the higher world; you are influenced by considerations drawn from the earthly, sensual, superficial, and transitory. It is not necessary to suppose that our Lord is clenching the Jews' harsh speech about the underworld with a <span class="accented">tu-quoque</span>, as though they verily belonged to the Gehenna to which they were consigning him; for the next pair of clauses are in parallel apposition with the former. In the words, <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of this world; I am not of this world,</span> "This world" corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> of the previous clause, and the "not of this world" corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, the heavenly regions from which he has continually declared, in many varieties of phrase, that he had come, or descended, or been sent. Certainly and broadly speaking, this is true, as a contrast between Christ and all other men before their regeneration. Our Lord especially charges home upon these earth-bound souls, on these purely human, selfish, unspiritual, unrenewed, unbelieving men, this antagonism to himself, this refusal to walk in his light or receive his life. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" (<a href="../../par/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>). They are flesh. He does not exclude them forever from such participation in his own heavenly life as would reverse the descriptive and characteristic features of their being. The reason why they have not seen the kingdom or the King is that they are not born of the Spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a></div><div class="verse">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i>he</i>, ye shall die in your sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I said unto you, Ye shall die in your sins: for if ye shall not have believed that I am</span> (HE), <span class="cmt_word">ye will die in your sins.</span> This last clause, "for," etc., gives our Lord's reason in full for the terrific fact. It is a virtual reference of the unregenerate, earthly, low-born condition of his hearers to the fact of their unbelief in him. This fleshly, worldly state may be, might be, reversed by their faith in his essential character, an adequate moral surrender to his claims. Let them believe him to be that which he really is, the separation would then cease, and, like himself, they too might be "called out of the world." They might be "born of the Spirit," enter into the fellowship of the Son of God, become "not of this world," "even as he is not of this world." They might "arise, and go to their Father." There is no impassable chasm between them, though it is an appalling one to be crossed only by a faith which is itself the form and essence of regeneration. The faith is especially defined. Three times in this chapter our Lord represents the object of faith, the central focus of the Divine revelation, to be "I AM." The predicate is unexpressed here, and the same may be said in ver. 28 and ver. 58. Elsewhere the predicate may easily be gathered from the context (<a href="../../par/john/9-9.htm">John 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-5.htm">John 18:5, 6, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-6.htm">Mark 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-8.htm">Luke 21:8</a>). Meyer and many others have said, "The true predicate here is 'the <span class="accented">Christ</span>:' 'I am the coming One,' 'the promised One,' 'the Sent of God.'" It is a somewhat dubious proceeding to draw the central idea of this chapter from an unexpressed ellipsis. The "<span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am"</span> of these passages cannot be regarded as equivalent to the "I am that I am" of Exodus, or to the incommunicable name of the eternal One, but it is analogous to it. Throughout the prophets the unique and solitary grandeur of the Divine nature in its special covenant relations with Israel is expressed by the phrase, "I AM HE." This was the sum of the object of the Old Testament faith (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-13.htm">Isaiah 41:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>, etc.). In like manner, the fulness of the Divine Ego in the incarnate Word is inexpressible by any one predicate. His entire revelation of himself had given this amplitude and indefinable breadth to his Personality. He had called himself the Son of God, the living Water, the veritable Bread, the Bread of God and of heaven, the Light of the world. He was indefinitely more than the current, popular idea of the Christ, immeasurably different from that which they persisted in expecting. Faith in that he is, in what he is, and in what he has revealed to them, is the germ of the life eternal. To refuse this faith is to refuse the hope that breaks over the gloom of <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, and to leave the full burden of sin upon the conscience. Compare St. Paul's words (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17, 18</a>), "If Christ be not risen...  ye are yet in your sins." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-25.htm">John 8:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then said they unto him, Who art thou?

He sees the multitudinous sides of every truth, and frequently gives to his questioners the means of answering their question from the ground of deep spiritual conviction, rather than furnishes them with a formula which might easily be abused. <span class="accented">Who art thou?</span> How profoundly pathetic! How confirmatory of his own words, "Ye have not known me, nor my Father"! The reply which our Lord gave to the question has occasioned greater variety of interpretation than, perhaps, any other sentence in the Gospel: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The meaning of the words taken separately is disputable; the relation to the context has been very variously understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence  may be taken interrogatively: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> regarded adverbially in the sense of "at all," and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense of "why?" which is perhaps justified by <a href="../../par/mark/9-11.htm">Mark 9:11, 28</a>. So that it might mean, <span class="accented">Why do I even speak with you at all?</span> This is the interpretation of the ancient Greek Fathers, Cyril and Chrysostom; is preferred by Lucke ('Comm.,' 2:301-313); and with slight modifications is adopted by Ewald (who gives it more the form of an exclamation, "How is it that I should have to speak to you at all!" [this rendering is put in the margin of R.T.], Westcott and Moulton (see note to Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament,' pp. 581, 582), Matthai, and others. Meyer has differed somewhat in successive editions, but (4th edit.) translates, "What I from the beginning am also speaking to you (do ye ask)?" Can you still be asking concerning that which I have been from the beginning saying to you, viz. "Who I am"? This interpretation is singularly obscure. It turns on the fact that, except in some virtually negative sentences, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> cannot have the force of "at all," and falls back on the conclusion that it must, when used adverbially, have the force of "from the first." Lucke devotes great space to the proof from classical Greek that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> never means <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">omnino, except</span> in association with a negative sentence, and he discusses the four exceptions to this supposed rule which some grammarians have discovered in secular Greek (Lennep. 'Ap. Phalarid.,' pp. 82, 55, and 92), and thereupon, in a different way from Meyer, endeavours to supply the negative conception. In reply to Meyer, it is fair to say that Christ had not been constantly announcing in categorical terms who he was and is; and further, that the rendering practically introduces a clause, "do ye ask," which is not in the text; moreover, its rendering transforms <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Many have advocated an affirmative rendering. Augustine (with Lampe and Fritzsche) takes <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as the <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> of the universe, the <span class="accented">principium</span> (as <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>), and translates," Believe that I am the <span class="accented">Principium</span> (the Logos), because I am also speaking with you (because, humbled on your account, I have descended to such words as these)." Chrysostom and Nonnus (who turned the Gospel into Greek hexameters) associate the sentence with what follows; thus: "I, the <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, who also speak to you, have many things to say and judge of you." The accusative form is thus set at nought. Calvin takes <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the beginning" (so that the meaning would be, "I did not arise suddenly, but as I was formerly promised, so now I come forth publicly"), "<span class="accented">because I also speak with you."</span> In other words, "What I now speak is in accordance with the conditions made in all ages 'from the beginning.' So Delitzsch, Hebrew version of New Testament. Luthardt seems to approach this view, which he makes more difficult by insisting that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> does not mean "from" but "at the beginning." The view of Winer, Grimm, Alford, Stier, Godet, Thoma, and Plummer, is substantially the same, giving to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> the sense of <span class="accented">omnino. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Essentially</span>, <span class="accented">wholly, altogether</span> (<span class="cmt_word">I am</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that which even I am saying to you.</span> The grammatical objection that this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> demands a negative sentence in classic Greek, is not conclusive. This is the only place in the New Testament where the word is used adverbially, and it is in reply to a mocking question which has much virtual negative in it. Green ('Critical Notes') urges that the sense of "altogether" (<span class="accented">omnino</span>) was preserved in all kinds of sentences without distinction. He does not prove it, but it is entirely probable that it might have this force in New Testament Greek. The great advantage of the rendering is that it brings the answer into relation with the entire previous discourse, in which Christ's testimony to himself had been disputed because (in the opinion of those who were debating with him) that testimony had not been adequately supported. "I am the Revelation of the Father, the Messenger from heaven, the Bread of God, the Light of the world - essentially that which I am saying to you." Believe my own testimony thus far, and that will answer the query, "Who art thou?" There is no great distinction between this view and that of De Wette: "Von vorne herein (vor allen Dingen) bin ich was ich auch zu euch rede," as Bruckner put it - "From the beginning, from the first, (I am) what I am also saying to you." Winer's view seems to me the best. Grimm thus translates: "Omnino, hoc est sine ulla exceptione sum, quod etiam vobis eloquor, non solum sum, sed etiam vobis, praedico id quod sum."

They refused these testimonies to himself which, if true, would necessitate their instantaneous submission.

"Speak <span class="accented">into</span>, so that the words may reach as far as and spread through the world" (Westcott). The expression seems to have left him <span class="accented">above</span> or outside the world, so that he appears as "the Mediator between two worlds."

This difficult parenthesis of the evangelist calls attention to the fact that, during the immediately preceding discourse and controversy, Jesus had dropped his references to the Father, and had used the periphrasis, "he that sent me," probably suggesting to this strangely excited populace, fed with weird fancies and wild expectations, that the mysterious Being with whom they were conversing was but the Delegate of One mightier than he, who was hidden in the secret place of God's providence until the hour of his own manifestation should appear to have struck. They might have remembered the utter deference which the great prophet John had displayed before a Messiah whom as yet they knew not. They may have heard that even John himself, at a later date, sent from the prison two of his disciples to propound the query, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" in other words, "Art thou the final Manifestation of all that I have predicted and believed? or is <span class="accented">another</span> to make his appearance with fire and axe and available force to compel obedience and to secure universal homage?" It is more than probable that the evangelist, being personally alive to the cross currents of passion, enthusiasm, and hostility which were at work in the hearts of the populace, saw by the very blankness and confusion on their faces, and the "asides" of the multitude, that they had not perceived that Jesus was throughout in these references speaking of <span class="accented">the Father of all</span> - the supreme Source of all power, the Lord of hosts. Even when he had said, "Ye have not known me, nor my Father," they had not risen to such a conception of the Lord's meaning as to suppose that the supreme Father himself was being suggested to them and cited as the corroborative Witness, as the supernatural Aid and Divine Presence which was giving validity to all that Christ has said about himself. Their ignorance and lack of perception need not astonish us when we reflect upon the obscurity and non-receptivity of the apostles themselves, and the like obtuseness of theologians and cultivated men of the world in every age from that day to this. The remark is, moreover, added doubtless to interpret the following verses, in which the ideas of ver. 26 are repeated, with the difference that, whereas he had already spoken of him that sent him, and who had authorized his words and judgments, Jesus now gives to him the beloved name of "the Father." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i>he</i>, and <i>that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - But when Jesus turns to them again he calls special attention to the main source of their continuous misconception and rejection. Not only is he "the Son," and "the Son of God," but indubitably he is also "the Son of man." He has come down from heaven and is before them as a Man among men - "one Jesus." He has taken upon himself the form of a slave, the fashion of man. That the manifestation of the Divine should be perfectly realized in the human, though a fundamental truth lying at the heart of all revelation, is nevertheless <span class="accented">not</span> the alphabet of Divine teaching; nay, it is the very highest and most recondite of all truths. This humbled humanity of the incarnate Logos led on to other issues of enormous significance. The eternal Son in the form of God would become, as "Son of man," obedient unto death. The highest revelation of the Son of God, and therefore of the Father, would be effected by the surrender of that mysterious life of his for the world's behoof. The previous announcements of this truth, which we now see to be the very crown and culmination of the gospel, had greatly offended his hearers of all kinds, and on distinct grounds. In the words that follow a touch of deeper meaning than any which had preceded is supplied when he proceeds to associate this death of the Son of man with the wilful act of the ecclesiastical authorities in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said</span> (<span class="accented">unto them</span>), <span class="cmt_word">When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man</span> (compare here notes on John 3:14; 6:62; 12:32). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is used with the twofold sense of exaltation on the cross" signifying by what death he should glorify God" - and also of the issues of that lifting up by means of the tree of ignoble torment and mortal agony to the throne of glory. The twofold meaning of the word cannot be excluded here. <span class="cmt_word">Then ye shall come to</span>  <span class="cmt_word">know</span> - then the process of proof will be completed - <span class="cmt_word">that I am</span> (<span class="cmt_word">he</span>) - that I am that which fundamentally I am declaring to you, that my testimonies have unique but trenchant confirmation - <span class="cmt_word">and that I am doing nothing from myself, but that even as the Father taught me,</span> (so) <span class="cmt_word">these things I speak.</span> The "he that sent me" (ver. 26), is here replaced by "the Father." "The things which I heard from (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) him" is replaced by "even as the Father taught me," and the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> are repeated. "The cross and the crown" will be the proof to the most obtuse and bigoted "<span class="accented">that I am</span> that which I say I am." The forecast is here given of the conversion of his murderers, the overwhelming effects produced by the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../../par/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>).

This self-consciousness of Christ is one of the loftiest and most entirely unique phenomena recorded in history. This absolute confidence with reference to his whole course lifts our Lord to a pinnacle of the loftiest elevation. He declares himself absolutely free from sin, and even in thought or deed to have left undone nothing that seemed good to the Father. If such an utterance had not flashed the conviction of his Divine nature upon some of his hearers, it is impossible to conceive what would or could have done so

Another hint of the eyewitness and ear witness of this memorable scene; and, supposing that we read here a correct transcript of words that proceeded from his lips, we can do no other than cry with Thomas, "My Lord, and my God!" The remark is intercalated, as though St. John wished to emphasize the accuracy with which he had reported, on this occasion, the very words of his Lord, conveying their ambiguous phrase, and asserting in fresh form what had convinced St. John, on subsequent reflection, that he was what he said. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, to believe <span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">on</span>, a person, is to close with him, to accept all the collateral consequences of such trust, to be content to wait for fuller explanation, to cast self upon the object of faith, and allow the object of such trust to bear all the responsibility of the act. It is the form most frequently adopted by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 18, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39</a>, and many other places; cf. <a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20</a>); only once in the synoptic narrative (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> with <a href="../../par/mark/9-42.htm">Mark 9:42</a>). The form <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> occurs occasionally with the accusative (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a>, and frequently in the Acts); and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with the dative, also! <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, are used, implying even a closer and more intimate communion still with the Object of faith (see <a href="../../par/john/16-30.htm">John 16:30</a>). With these forms must be compared the more common one with the simple dative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>, which occurs in vers. 31, 45, and <a href="../../par/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>, etc., which implies acceptance of the saying, promise, or fact there propounded, and falls short of the moral surrender involved in the fuller form. John here asserts that <span class="accented">many</span> of his hearers, those who had hitherto refrained from full acceptance of Jesus as the Son of God, yielded to his claims there and then. This faith on the part of "some" is almost more wonderful than the unbelief of others. The difficulties in their way were appalling in comparison with the perplexities which beset our minds. The Lord appealed to his own inner consciousness, to  his supernatural aid in speech, to the spotless, sinless character of his hidden life. It was remarkable that any strangers or enemies should have surrendered themselves to them. The event shows that the surrender could not stand the test. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-59</span> describe a further conversation, not with the same audience. The words record a vivid conflict between the Lord and <span class="accented">the Jews who believed him</span>, who accepted the Messianic claims, but persisted in interpreting them, not by his word, but by their own ideas of the theocratic kingdom, by their privileges as children of Abraham, by their national animosity to their nearest neighbours the Samaritans, by their inability to press behind the veil of his humanity to his Divine nature. Their faith was of the most imperfect kind; but such as it was, it was made manifest to the observation of the apostle, and this throws light upon the fact that, among the many who <span class="accented">believed on him</span>, or rather alongside of these, there was a certain section of "the Jews," of the chief rulers and rabbis, who made a definite movement towards him. This doubtless excited the intense enthusiasm of the disciples, who might at once hope and almost expect that Jesus would with open arms accept their homage. But he at once puts this faith of theirs - perhaps ignorantly expressed - to a proof absolutely necessary for the salvation of his hearers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">The test Christ supplied to those who admitted his testimony</span> - <span class="accented">true discipleship and freedom. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Jesus therefore said to the Jews who had believed him</span> - or, <span class="accented">had become believing</span>, and were now waiting for some special sign that their belief of his words was to be immediately rewarded by some closer conformity between his next step and their own prepossessions - <span class="cmt_word">If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples.</span> Short of making the word of Jesus the resting place for both heart and intellect, full discipleship would be impossible. The true disciple receives and continues in the word of his Master. The expression expands and illustrates the difference between believing Christ to speak the truth, and believing in him. Many ancient Jews and modern Christians believe so much of Christ's word as is verified by their moral consciousness, and dispute or dispose of the rest as <span class="accented">Aberglaube.</span> The genuine disciple continues, abides, in the word of him who is the incarnate Word, yielding to it entire acquiescence, as the absolute reality of things, as the truth about God and man. He adds, <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall come fully to know the truth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to realize in the very depths of your being the trustworthy character of my word. "The Truth" (see <a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) is one of the distinguishing names which Jesus takes to himself. He is <span class="accented">the Truth</span>, and "full of grace and truth." So far this statement corresponds with <a href="../../par/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16, 17</a>. The "Jews" who had believed him would not feel the fiery ordeal and touch of flame applied to the sensitive skin of their pride and self-importance; but when he added, <span class="cmt_word">And the truth shall emancipate you,</span> the case was altered. Truth only can set the mind free from its bondage under ignorance and prejudice and evil habit. If the Light of the world shines into the dark places of the heart, the chains erewhile misunderstood will not only become visible, but will be broken. Godet beautifully says that "the empire of sin in a human heart is based upon an illusion, a fascination. Let truth shine, and the spell is broken, the will is disgusted with that which seduced it - 'the bird escapes from the net of the fowler.'" But this proffer of freedom to his disciples by continuing in his word was too startling a suggestion for their nascent and imperfect faith. He had told them that without faith in him they would die in their sins (ver. 24); now he assures them that, unless they abide steadfastly in his word, they will not escape from a bondage manifest enough to his eye, if not to theirs. This brings from them an angry response.

Vast were the pretensions which the Jews often assumed from this lofty ancestry. "They were all children of kings;" "Solomon's feast was not too good for them;" "He was heir of the world;" "They were the inheritors in him of all the nations." They had rung this cry into the ears of John the Baptist, when this last prophet had called upon them for repentance. Their following boast is difficult to understand: <span class="cmt_word">We have never yet been enslaved to anyone;</span> and great difference of opinion has prevailed over the meaning cf. these words. It is incredible that John should represent: the Jews as ignorant of their national political history. The first word of their Decalogue included a reference to the "house of bondage" from which Jehovah had delivered the seed of Abraham. Moreover, their political humiliation at the hand of the border kingdoms of Assyria, Babylon, and Syria was the perpetual theme of prophet and psalmist.  The terrible reverses that they had subsequently experienced at the hand of Antiochus and of the Roman power, and the galling submission to Rome which at the moment was rousing their fiercest passion, would render any such boast simply preposterous. Godet's suggestion, that they were making a boast of their personal civil freedom, that Abraham's seed were not sold into positive slavery, however mortifying their political servitude had proved, is far fetched and too far away from the facts of the case; neither does it harmonize with the character of this angry retort. Probably a reference is made to the ideal freedom from slavery and from dependence which they had, in their hour of deepest depression from all and every form of tyranny whatsoever, religiously maintained. They did, as their wonderful psalter shows, cherish a conviction that David's throne and Abraham's inheritance ideally stood through all the ages, lustrous and magnificent to the eye of faith. When the holy and beautiful house was burned with fire, when their exile was complete, they still saw all visible things, even "heaven and earth," departing or rolled up like a scroll, while their Creator and redeeming King was seated still on his eternal throne. From St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, they clearly held that the mere possession of the Law, whether they kept it or not, was their much-prized pledge of independence from all other authority or servitude. If so, they may have been on this occasion boasting of their ideal freedom in virtue of their he reditary privileges, and forgetful of the lessons even of the agelong story of Ishmael and Esau, and the deportation and abolition of Israel as a nation. One can scarcely refrain a momentary thrill of admiration at the hardihood of their eager faith, and the overwhelming strength of confidence they manifested in their destiny as a people. All the spiritual salvation and ideal freedom which they desired they possessed as children of Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">How sayest thou</span> - "Upon what possible principle dost thou promise to us that which we already are proud of possessing, viz. glorious liberty?"

Godet is strongly disposed, on the ground of the exceedingly small authority of D and <span class="accented">b</span> alone (and certain quotations of Origen), to believe that the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is a gloss. Certainly the whole passage would be easier to interpret if our Lord had simply said that the man under the habitual power of sin is a slave, and had then, in vers. 35 and 36, advanced to the contrast between the slave and the Son. But there is great unanimity among all the authorities as to the accuracy of the Received and Revised Texts, though Westcott and Hort place it in brackets. The interpretation, consequently, is simply this, that Christ did "pass from the idea of bondage under sin to that of bondage generally, and from the idea of sonship to the Son" (Westcott). The notion of personal transgression producing a bondage, and enfettering the soul and the will, and separating it from the glorious liberty of true sonship, lay outside of their notion of discipleship. They were not requiring deliverance from sin or its bondage; what they wanted was the full realization of the national hope. The language of this verse can be paralleled from the writings of the classics and rabbis, and is largely   handled by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a>. and 7.). The relation between sin as a principle and sins as acts of the will is a great New Testament revelation. The personal commission of sin augments the force of the corrupt tendency which leads to and facilitates fresh transgression. Every compliance with evil forges a new fetter, and imposes it on the will of the transgressor. "The strong man guards his house, and his goods are in peace" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-21.htm">Luke 11:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-35.htm">John 8:35</a></div><div class="verse">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i>but</i> the Son abideth ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - This being the fact as to sin and its servitude, the Lord proceeds to deal with servitude in God's house. Servitude and its spirit are manifested in the house of the Father. <span class="cmt_word">The bond slave abideth not in the house forever.</span> So long as he is a bond slave and not emancipated from the fetters of mere race, so long as he is ruled by the servile spirit, there is no perpetuity about his relation to the Father. He can be sold away (<a href="../../par/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>). An involuntary subject of the Law, who belongs to the theocracy as a slave merely, and because he cannot help himself, and occupies a position which a slave does in the family of sin, has lost all freedom and spontaneity in his service, and will find himself cast out at last. <span class="cmt_word">But the son abideth forever.</span> Sonship is the only principle on which <span class="accented">continuance</span> in the house can be secured. It has been much debated whether the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of the thirty-fifth verse goes beyond the idea of sonship, the generic antithesis to the idea of slave. Certainly this seems the primary reference. In the following verse, <span class="accented">the Son</span>, in his loftiest functions, and as identifying himself with "the truth" of ver. 32, entirely fulfils the conception of "Sonship" and eternal abiding in the Father's house, and therefore is entrusted with the power of emancipating all slaves, of adopting sons into the Father's royal house. Thus we may suppose that the first use of the term "son," though laying special emphasis on the spirit and conditions of sonship, yet points to him who entirely embodies, enshrines, and has from before all worlds realized the Divine idea of Son - the only begotten Son - in the bosom of the Father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a></div><div class="verse">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore if the Son</span> - who abideth ever in the Father's bosom, and fills the house with his glory, and is the Heir of all things - <span class="cmt_word">make you free, ye shall be free indeed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "essentially," only here used by St. John, who elsewhere uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 31; <a href="../../par/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-42.htm">John 4:42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>). The Son is he who gives power to become the sons of God. "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus frees from the law of sin and death" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>). Only by acquiring the true spirit and regenerated life of a son can any man be delivered from the bondage induced by ignorance of the actual truth about God, about man, and about the relation between God and man. This knowledge is produced by the Son of God, who is the Truth. A full and believing apprehension of the Son of God, a realization of what he is, confers a new life and reveals the wonderful possibilities and relations of human nature. The incarnation of the Son of God as a veritable Son of man emancipates the soul fettered by the tyranny of nature and baffled by the mastery of time and sense, inasmuch as it discloses the august majesty of its own origin. Essential freedom accrues to him who knows that sin is pardoned, that death is vanquished, that the prince of this world is cast out. The eager Jew might look through the battered walls of Zion and the charred fragments of its gorgeous temple, and still see the adamantine structure and its agelong triumph. But the disciples of Jesus, with John as their leader, when these words were recorded by him as they fell from the Lord in their true connection, saw the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband, with its open gates, its crystal stream, and the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb as the Light of it. The freedom of a perfect service and the glorious liberty of the sons of God was theirs, in proportion as they accepted their emancipation from the Son himself (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-35.htm">Romans 8:35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). The sons are "free indeed," whatever the world, or the Hebrew Christians, or the philosophers might think or say. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-37.htm">John 8:37</a></div><div class="verse">I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, I know absolutely, I do not come to know it from your retort) <span class="cmt_word">that ye are the seed of Abraham.</span> They belonged to the noble race, "whose are the fathers;" they were the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of him who received the promises. Christ admitted the pedigree, but he proceeds to show that mere hereditary descent would be of no avail to them apart from moral considerations. These ideas, these revolutionary conceptions, so far as Judaism was concerned, were not the evolution of Christian ideas in the second century. It is most instructive to see how clearly St. Paul had already grasped them, and woven them into a powerful argument when dealing with the Judaizers in Galatia, many years before this Gospel was written (see the entire argument of <a href="../../par/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, which thus rests on the teaching of the Christ himself). <span class="cmt_word">But ye seek to kill me.</span> This charge is certainly difficult to suppose applicable to those who "had come to believe in him" (ver. 31). One of three suppositions must be made - either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the believing Jews were surrounded by angry groups of his bitter enemies, to whom he here addressed himself;  or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Lord spoke here to them as representing the large company of Jerusalem opponents, whom he knew at that moment to be planning his death, and as all orators and debaters are in the habit of dealing with opposing arguments by showing the character they assume in others, who make them their boast; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> those who had come to believe him up to a certain point had as rapidly relapsed, at the first touch of spiritual proof, into disbelief and cruel hostility. This seems the more natural interpretation of the fact, which may, at the same time, have become patent from some angry manifestation of his implacable foes. There is much to be found in the background and scenery of this dramatic colloquy, reported with such extreme brevity, which would, if we exactly knew how to paint it, solve its difficulties. Ye seek to slay me, <span class="cmt_word">because my word</span> - the word which is mine - <span class="cmt_word">makes no progress</span> - or, <span class="accented">advance</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in you.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> has both transitive and intransitive meanings; thus it means "leave," "depart," "turn," or "come to," with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, "contain;" <a href="../../par/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>); but it has the force frequently in Plato "to make progress or advance," and it has this force here. So Meyer, Westcott, R.T., etc. (Luthardt and Tholuck suggest "find entrance," which would require <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>). Not only did they not <span class="accented">continue</span> in Christ's word (ver. 31), but the word itself made no way in their minds; it was barred out by prejudices, and thus choked at its very first working. Christ thus represents his word first as the very atmosphere and home in which his true disciples abide, and then as a powerful influence which grows evermore in power and command as it is pondered. It means more and more to those who abide in it; it implicitly contains a whole universe of truth and reality, of impulse and motive, for those who allow to it "free course" - who are of the truth, and hear his voice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-38.htm">John 8:38</a></div><div class="verse">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak the things</span> <span class="cmt_word">which I have seen with the (</span><span class="accented">my<span class="cmt_word"></span>) Father:</span> <span class="cmt_word">and do you therefore the things which ye heard</span> <span class="cmt_word">from the</span> (<span class="accented">your</span>) <span class="cmt_word">father;</span> or, <span class="accented">and you therefore do the things which ye heard from your father.</span> We need not, with Meyer, limit the Lord's vision of the Divine things which he saw with the Father to his premundane Personality. He describes himself in constant communion with the Father. The Father is with him. He knows the mind and will and good pleasure of the Father. His is the perfectly pure heart, which is as an eye forevermore beholding the Father. That the Only Begotten sees and knows what no other sees, is constantly taught in this Gospel (see <a href="../../par/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>). In Christ, moreover, the disciple may verily see the Father (<a href="../../par/john/14-7.htm">John 14:7, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-23.htm">1 John 2:23</a>). The probable textual reading given above would draw a species of contrast between Christ's "seeing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) with the Father, and the Jews' "hearing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) from the Father, as though such communication were less intimate than "seeing." This must not be pressed (see ver. 40). If the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> be imperative, the language would be an appeal to the Jews to act out that which, from prophets and teachers and interpreters of the Divine will, they had heard. Moulton treats the clause as one more, one last, exhortation. The word of Christ had not advanced within them - it remained as a barren formula; let them give it free course now. Their opposition had not as yet been malignant or hopeless; one more chance is given them. The more ordinary interpretation is to make the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> indicative. If it be so, and still more if the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (omitted by B, L, P) be genuine, "the father" to whom reference is made as theirs, is in contrast with the Father of Christ, and, without pointedly saying so, Jesus implies that it is another father altogether. In ver. 44 Christ does indeed declare that the father with whom they are in ethical relation and sympathy is not God, but the devil - the very opposite of the God of Abraham, the very antithesis of the Father of infinite love. At this point   he simply suggests, "Therefore the things which ye heard from your father ye do," ye habitually do, ye are now doing in your hatred and murderous sentiments towards myself. Surely this implies a severity which is hardly compatible with an address to Jews who believed him. The interpretation of the following verse is governed by that of this. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a></div><div class="verse">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered and said.</span> If the second interpretation be accepted, then, irritated by the suggestion that "the Father" whose properties and claims he saw and revealed to them was different from "the father" whose nature and ways they "heard" and practised, and counting, moreover, on the concession of the fact that they were Abraham's "seed," they cried, <span class="cmt_word">Our father is Abraham;</span> we are spiritually, ethically, related to him, and if we are doing that which we have heard from our father, then we can claim that all we are doing is along the lines of our Abrahamic dignity.

The excitement produced by this bold charge among his own true disciples, and those who now for the first time heard of it, by our Lord's then and there lifting the veil from many a specious question; the look of guilt on the countenances of some, of truculent admission of the charge in the gesture of others; the loud murmurs and confused cries of the crowd, - must all be realized to apprehend the tremendous crisis which had now arrived. He aggravated the charge by describing himself as <span class="cmt_word">a man who hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">declared to you the truth which I heard from God.</span> This is the only place where the Lord speaks of himself as "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">man"</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). He here describes himself as One who is subject and liable to their murderous passion - <span class="accented">a man</span>, seeing that his eternal Personality has been presented to his antagonists in the form of man. His manhood was the link of relation between the God who sent him, taught him, surrounded and enveloped him, and the consciousness of his hearers. This is the highest representation of the very conception of a Divine commission and a Divine message. They were seeking to stamp out a Divine fire, to drown a heavenly voice, to refuse and trample upon a sacred Messenger. <span class="cmt_word">This did not Abraham.</span> The father of the faithful was susceptible to the heavenly voice, he heard and obeyed the voice of Jehovah with childlike docility (<a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12, 14, 18, 22</a>.). The visions, the commands, the messengers, the manifestations, of God to Abraham were so readily accepted that his faith is a proverb, and his greatest name is "friend of God." The wilful, hurried, malicious treatment of both the Divine Messenger and the sacred message, both of which Jesus declared to have come directly from God, proves the lack of relation with the Life of Abraham. They might be Abraham's "seed" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) but not his (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) children, and he in this sense could not be their "father."

Abrupt and startling was the retort: <span class="cmt_word">We are</span> [were] <span class="cmt_word">not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.</span> Many expositors think  that these Jews began to babble against the possibility of their being bastard children of Sarah, or to protest that they were not Ishmaelites or any collateral branch of the seed of Abraham, like the Idumaeans or the sons of Keturah. This is far away from the context, and unworthy of the controversy. The idea is sufficiently explained by the second clause. The covenant relation between Jehovah and Israel is so constantly referred to in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>) under the image of marriage and the unfaithfulness of particular generations to Jehovah; and their false worship and idolatry are so often regarded as "fornication" and "adultery" from God, the Husband of the dedicated spouse, so that nothing is more probable, when Jesus charged them with doing the works of their father, that they should have exclaimed, "Surely we have no idolatrous sympathies. None but Jehovah is our God. Thou must not charge us with any compromise with the accursed thing." The wild rage which the Jews had shown to Pilate in the matter of the shields, their abhorrence of the defilement of idols in the matter of food, their avoidance even of the supreme court of Roman justice under fear of idolatrous contamination, explain the outflash of this indignant rejoinder. This view is, in the main, advocated by De Wette, Lampe, Lucke, Lange, and Hengstenberg; but opposed by Meyer, Westcott: "We do not owe our position to idolatrous desertion of Jehovah. We are the offspring of the union of God with his chosen people. Our spiritual descent is as pure as our historical descent." Godet modifies it: "We have no idolatrous <span class="accented">blood</span> in our veins; we are Hebrews of the Hebrews." They claim to be the children of God, as well as children of Abraham (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>).

He mournfully asks why they had failed to get to understand the method of his converse; why they perpetually failed to appreciate his discourse; why they  persistently put wrong constructions upon his phrase, and imagined him to be speaking of earthly things when he was discoursing to them of heavenly ones. Why? <span class="cmt_word">Because ye cannot hear my word -</span> the Divine communication I have made to you. They were morally so far from him that they could not listen so as to receive his revelation. The inward organ of receptivity was lacking, and "so the spiritual idiom in which he spake was not spiritually understood" (Alford). The Divine significance of the whole word of Christ, the new and strange doctrines of Messiah, of redemption, of the Father, of a sacrifice and death on the part of the Son of man for the salvation of the world excited their animosity and bitter antipathies. They were not conscious of any of the need he came to satisfy, and so they failed to apprehend the entire manner of his revelation. They were from beneath (ver. 23). He is disclosing heavenly things. "Their ears have they closed, lest they should hear." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a></div><div class="verse">Ye are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of the father who is the devil.</span> In this way the great bulk of the best commentators translate this difficult clause, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, and Davidson translate, "You are of the father of the devil;" and suggest that here the evangelist betrays his fierce Gnostic (Ophite) antagonism to the Jews, and adopts the view that the God of the Old Testament, the "Creator," was the Father of the serpent. This is surely untenable. The Creator of all things, in the prologue, is none other than the Father acting through the Logos. In the third, fourth, and fifth chapters, the greatest honours are ascribed to the God of the Jewish people, and not the faintest hint given of such radical divergence from the standpoint of Judaism. In this very passage the father of the faithful Jews is spoken of with profound reverence. "The second-century Gnostic" must have so cleverly concealed his sentiments, and have refuted his position so frequently, that it is inexcusably inept for him to have shown his cloven foot on this occasion. Thoma ignores the wild conjecture of Hilgenfeld. Our Lord was not dealing with the parentage of the devil, but with the moral and religious parentage of those Jews who were manifesting the most bitter antagonism to himself and plotting his destruction. For them to claim spiritual kinship and childlike feeling to the Father whose holy nature and whose love to them he was revealing, was a strange contradiction in terms. Our Lord repudiated it in this terrible language. He had worsted the seductive suggestions of the devil, and when he saw and heard them repeated and set forth as Divine proposals, he gave them their true name. "You disclaim the faintest sympathy with other gods; you resent the bar sinister on your escutcheon; you say that religiously as well as historically you are not born of any fornication - there is no taint in your theological position; but I tell you plainly that <span class="accented">you are from</span>, you are manifesting the very essence and substance of, the father who is the prime enemy of God and man. The phrase is in perfect keeping with many synoptic phrases (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; cf. John the Baptist's language, <a href="../../par/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the lusts of your father</span> - those of falsehood and murder, lying and slaughter, being the top and chief of all his evil passions - <span class="cmt_word">ye are</span> willing, <span class="cmt_word">desirous to do</span>. He has engendered these very lusts within you. The paternity of your angry passions, your incapacity to see and accept my word, are both alike explained. There is no more terrible rebuke in the whole compass of revelation. The disciple whom Jesus loved, in preserving these words, shows very decidedly that he was a "Son of Thunder," and calls down fire from heaven (a very storm) which has been ever since descending upon the heads of these and all other bitter antagonists of the Son of man. <span class="cmt_word">He was a murderer</span> (literally, <span class="accented">a manslayer</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from the beginning.</span> This has often been referred to the spirit which animated Cain in the slaughter of his brother Abel. There is some corroboration of such a reference in <a href="../../par/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>, "Cain was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of that wicked one, and slew his brother;" and in the language of <a href="../../par/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>, "Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer." (So Lucke, Reuss, De Wette, and others.) But the narrative of the death of Abel makes no reference to the agency of the devil, but rather indicates that the sin of Cain was originated by his having been begotten in the image of the fallen Adam. The better interpretation and reference of the words may be seen in <a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>, "He that doeth sin is from the devil (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), for the devil sinneth from the beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)." And sin entered into the world through the seduction and false statements of the devil, by which the first man was veritably slain, his moral nature killed outright. Grace was not shut out, but Adam died. In the day that he ate of the forbidden tree, man most surely and in the deepest sense <span class="accented">died.</span> "God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of its side do find it" (Wisd. 2:23, 24; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>); "Sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (<a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The work of destruction at the beginning of humanity upon earth has never been exhausted. In murderous propensity, in lying and seductive words and ways, the children of wrath are ever showing their parentage. To this statement  our Lord added what has by many been regarded as a distinct revelation of the fall of Satan himself from the condition of rectitude (cf. <a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He stands not;</span> continues not - in the truth (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the perfect is the better reading, and demands this translation; the rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">stetit</span>, favoured by Augustine, and involving a reference to the <span class="accented">fall of the devil</span>, would have required <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, pluperfect). Jesus (lid not, therefore, explicitly assert anything with reference to the act of original revolt of the devil, but declared that the devil has no place in truth; he restlessly resists, throwing a hopeless, perilous glamour of falsehood round all he touches. Schaff suggests, rightly, that the combination of this statement with that of the prologue (<a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) <span class="accented">presupposes</span> the fall of this mighty and murderous spirit from a previous condition of rectitude, and the dictum of our Lord ought never to have been charged with the admission of an eternal principle of evil. The fall of the lost angels is not explicitly stated. <span class="cmt_word">Because there is no truth in him.</span> The absence of the article before "truth" shows that in the previous clause the objective truth is meant, that the reality of things as known by him is referred to. The truth was that region or sphere of action in which he elected not to stand, and, as a matter of fact, does not stand nor find place. By "truth" is meant subjective truth or "truthfulness," the spirit which repudiates falsehood in all its forms and manifestations. There is no consistency with himself, no inward harmony with reality. This is given as reason why the devil stands not in <span class="accented">the</span> truth. <span class="cmt_word">Whensoever</span> <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">speaketh a lie, he speaketh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, out of) <span class="cmt_word">his own</span> resources - from what is most entirely his own, revealing the depth of his truthless, loveless, fatal, godless nature. Schaff quotes from Gothe's 'Faust' the account which Mephistopheles gives of his own being. Here it is in Kegan Paul's translation - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I am the spirit, who aye deny!<br />And rightly so; for everything<br />Is only good for perishing;<br />So better 'twere that nought had been,<br />And, therefore, all that you call sin<br />Ruin, whate'er with evil's rife<br />Is my true element of life."</span> Gothe exactly expressed the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> by "mein eigentliches element." <span class="cmt_word">Because he is a liar, and the father of the liar.</span> This translation makes the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the most natural antecedent (so Bengel, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc.), notwithstanding the difficulty of the construction. This language asserts not only the agelong proof which history gives of the falsehood of this terrible personality, but declares that he exerts an evil paternity in the life of every liar. "Brood of vipers" is a phrase used by John Baptist and Christ himself when addressing Pharisees. The well known imagery of the first promise, "I will put enmity between her seed and thy seed," etc., suggests the same thought. There is an awful significance in this power of the devil to sow his deadly seed in human life, and to produce thus, on the soil of human nature, "children of the wicked one" (cf. Paul's language, <a href="../../par/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>, addressed to Elymas, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "son of the devil"). Another translation makes <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">He is a liar, and the father of falsehood</span>, or <span class="accented">thereof</span> (Revised Version); thus drawing an abstract out of the concrete <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or possibly referring to the first he which slew the spiritual life of men - to the "Ye shall not surely die" of <a href="../../par/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>. It is against this view that our Lord is here dealing with persons rather than with abstractions. Westcott and Moulton and Revised Version in margin have given indefiniteness to the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>, and translate, "Whensoever one [or, 'a man'] speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for his father also is a liar;" the idea being that the evil inheritance from the father of lies has even made falsehood the essential element, the <span class="accented">proprium</span>, of the liar. This, however, appears to involve a very complicated thought. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, if strictly spoken, contradicts the idea of the liar's peculiarities being the result of inheritance. Still less satisfactory is the vain endeavour of the Gnostics, who found here a second reference to the father of the devil. They discovered in some Italic Versions, and in the usage of some of the Fathers, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, and so took it to mean, "he is a liar, as also his father." Higenfeld and Volkmar have fastened upon this text also, and thus found further proof of Gnostic (Ophite) heresy in the Gospel. Riggenbach and Godet have remarked that, if the father of the devil was spoken of in the previous clause, "his father" would mean "the father of the father of the devil"! We have already seen how groundless such a charge against the Gospel is, and how such a rendering would throw the entire context into confusion. If we accept the first translation, we find that our Lord  announces a doctrine concerning the devil, and conveys more information than can be obtained from any other source. This is not mere accommodation to the consciousness of a daemoniac or the prejudices of the Jews, as some have interpreted Christ's language in the synoptic Gospels, but it is distinct dogmatic teaching about the personality, character, and method of the devil.

If he spake lies to them, they would greedily receive them. The very cause of their lack of credence is the utterance of truth. The "I" is emphatic, and set over against the "you" of the second clause. There is a tragic force about this charge almost unparalleled, implying the most wilful estrangement from God, a rejection of known truth because it was truth, a love of darkness because it was darkness, a moral obtuseness which answers to the terrible language, "Lest they should see with their eyes," etc.

Nor is it sound exegesis to limit <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to one particular form of sin (such as "false doctrine," Calvin, Melancthon, Tholuck). There is no need to limit its reference; and in the unanswered query, while we cannot say that by itself this passage is sufficient to demonstrate the sinlessness of Christ, it reveals a sublime depth in his translucent consciousness that places him - unless he were the most deluded or self-sufficient of human teachers - on a different position from all other Divine messengers. In proportion as other great moral prophets have set their own standard high, they have become conscious of their own defects; and from Moses to St. Paul, from Augustine to St. Francis, the saintliest men have been the most alive to their own departures from their ideas of right. The standard of Jesus is higher than that of any other, and he appears nevertheless absolutely without need of repentance, above the power of temptation, beyond the range of conviction. True, the Jews brought a charge of madness and folly upon him immediately; but, so far from convincing him or mankind, they stand forever covered with the shame of their own incompetence to apprehend his message or himself. He being, then, without sin, and assuming that he stands in the eternal truth, and is the absolute Truth of things, and that he cannot from his moral purity deceive or misinform them, and that his testimony to himself is final, sufficient, and trustworthy, asks, <span class="cmt_word">If I say the truth</span> - without your having convicted me of sin or brought any moral obliquity or offence against me - <span class="cmt_word">if I say</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> The reason is in them rather than in him. Their non-belief discloses no flaw in his revelation, but makes it evident that they and he are on different planes of being, with a discrepant, opposed, moral paternity. "Why do ye not believe me?" He marvelled at their unbelief! He is from God; they are from God's great enemy. The moral perfection of Jesus as the God-Man is absolutely necessary to his character as "God's Lamb," as "the Only Begotten," "the Son," and as "the Judge," of the human race. As he subsequently said, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing fit me." To account for this sinless, perfect humanity, the entire conception of the Divine nature blended in indissoluble union with his own is found imperative at every epoch of Christ's life. At every development of his official character, in every new combination of circumstance, in conflict and sorrow, when smarting from treachery and dying alone upon the cross, he is "perfect," he fulfils the perfect norm, he reaches the standard of Divine humanity. There is no discrepance here with even Mark's account of his language to the young ruler (<a href="../../par/mark/10-18.htm">Mark 10:18</a>), for he does not there say that he is not good, nor does he do other than suggest that he is identified with the One who is good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a></div><div class="verse">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear <i>them</i> not, because ye are not of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 47-58.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> THE I AM. <span class="accented">The claim to be the Source of liberty and life, in reply to those who appealed to their Father God and their father Abraham, led Jesus to assert his anteriority to Abraham.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - There was some pause after this searching inquiry. Silence showed that, if they could not convince him of sin, they were ready with no answer to his question. He assumes that his word is unanswerable; he is what he says he is, and is able to set men free from sin and to give them eternal life. Their position is still further explained by a distinct syllogism, of which the major premiss is: <span class="cmt_word">He that is of</span> <span class="cmt_word">God heareth the words of God;</span> words which it is obviously taken for granted he is freely, surely uttering. Who are the persons referred to? Some, like Hilgenfeld,  discover here a Manichaean, Gnostic sense - "those who are essentially of a Divine origin and spiritual nature," are absolutely different from those who are of the psychic or hylic nature. Thus they cut away all force from the moral reproof which follows. Others insist that here Jesus speaks of the regenerated man, the true child of God, who has power to believe, who has come to the Father, being predestinated unto eternal life. Even this interpretation does not leave sufficiently ample play to the human freedom, and the personal self-responsibility, which pervades the teaching of the gospel. Elsewhere he speaks of these who are "of the truth" and "hear his voice," of "those whom the Father draws" to him by the very love and grace which he, the Son, lavishes upon them (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6, 9, 11</a>). He also speaks of those who come to him being given to him. He is here contemplating this wide class, who are scattered through all time and places, with susceptible minds capable of hearing freely, and believing when they hear, the words of God. For this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> seeing that ye do not hear the words of God, it is evident that ye are not of God. They are not excluded from becoming so by any irreversible fate, but their present obtuseness of spiritual perception, their refusal to accept truth on its clearest exposition, shows that they are not born of God; they are not being drawn to him by inworking of the Father's grace. The very form of the expression was once more meant to touch their conscience. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48</a></div><div class="verse">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - But it brought from them a shout of derision and a burst of scornful mockery. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a daemon?</span> They imagine that the bare charge that they, the leaders of Israel, are "not of God," and that they reveal the fact by their inability to hear the words of God then sounding in their ears, was flat heresy, a gross lack of patriotism, and proved that, in his lofty self-assertion, he was no better than a Samaritan - the most hated of their neighbours. They return a harsh <span class="accented">tu-quoque</span> to our Lord's refusal to admit their Abrahamic descent, and his condemnation of their utter moral dissimilarity from their putative father. The sentence, "a Samaritan art thou!" is singularly insulting in its tone and form. We cannot measure the exact amount of insult they condensed into this word, whether it be of heresy, or alienation from Israel, or accusation of impure descent. It is remarkable that our Lord had shown special kindness to Samaritans (ch. 4.), and had made in his parable "the good Samaritan" the type of neighbourly love; but these very Jews had, in the height of this controversy, accused him of being a "Galilaean," and it is not probable that they used the term otherwise than as a soubriquet of scorn. Edersheim (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, 2:174, 175) would translate into Aramaic the language here cited, and finds in its form <span class="accented">Shomroni</span> the real interpretation of its meaning. <span class="accented">Shomron</span> is, according to him, used in rabbinical writing for <span class="accented">Ashmedai</span>, and in the cabbalists is used for <span class="accented">Sammael</span> or <span class="accented">Satan.</span> Arabian traditions are brought in to confirm this interpretation of the speech, which he regards as equivalent to "Thou art a child of the devil," thus retorting upon Jesus the charge that they were doing the works of <span class="accented">their</span> father, the devil. The one expression is thought by Edersheim equivalent to that which follows, <span class="accented">thou hast a daemon</span>; and his explanation is thought to cover our Lord's silence respecting it. In our opinion this is far-fetched and unnatural. Christ's silence is better justified by his refusal to regard such a term as conveying opprobrium, tic had risen above the distinction of race, and could afford to despise the taunt. In <a href="../../par/john/7-20.htm">John 7:20</a> (see note) a similar charge had been made by the angry Jews. The Lord is accused of being mastered by some daemon, who is perverting his mind and confusing his speech. Some further force is added to the charge from the language of the Talmud, 'Jebamoth,' fol. 47, <span class="accented">a</span>: "R. Nachman, son of Isaac, said to a Samaritan, 'Thou art a Cuthite, and testimony from thy mouth has no validity.'" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-49.htm">John 8:49</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - To this <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered,</span> in calm and patient remonstrance, <span class="cmt_word">I have not a daemon.</span> No strange or evil power haunts me; I am perfectly clear in my consciousness. Once before, when accused of complicity with Beelzebub, he had retorted with awful solemnity, and an appeal to the conscience of his enemies and to the patent facts of his own warfare with all the kingdom of Satan. It is interesting to observe that he takes no notice of the charge, "Thou art a Samaritan." If the above suggestion of Edersheim were accepted, the silence would be explained; but it was more probably occasioned by Christ's unwillingness to repudiate fellowship with this persecuted nationality. The parable of the good Samaritan was probably delivered about this time. Here he simply repudiated the second charge, and added, <span class="cmt_word">But I honour my Father,</span> in declaring that these words of his would be acceptable to you if you were of God (ver. 47), <span class="cmt_word">and</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> strengthens the contrast between the two clauses rather than between: the "I" and "you") - and, while I am doing honour to my Father, <span class="cmt_word">ye are dishonouring me;</span> for you are casting these reproaches upon me, refusing my offers of mercy,  freedom, and life, veritable revelations though they be of the heart of the Father.

It is impossible that the Jews should have listened unmoved to Christ's rejoinder on their rude taunt, or been unimpressed by the self-composed and lofty way in which the honour of our Lord was calmly entrusted by him to the Father. The Jews may say what they please, call him by any opprobrious name they choose; "there is One that seeketh" his glory, and he is content. He has, in earlier portions of this discourse, promised freedom and sonship to those who abide in his word; and now to those who believed on him he says, with extraordinary emphasis, <span class="cmt_word">If a man</span> (any one) <span class="cmt_word">have kept my word, he shall never behold death.</span> This "keeping" is more than "abiding" in the word. There is the additional notion of intently watching the "keeping," which issues in "fulfilling" and "obeying" (Meyer and Tholuck); see ver. 55; <a href="../../par/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15, 21, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>. The opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> would be "to disregard;" the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> would be "to let slip" (Westcott). The promise is dazzling: "He shall never behold," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> steadily or exhaustively know by experience, what <span class="accented">death</span> means and is. He may pass through physical death, he may (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) taste of dissolution, he may come before the judgment seat, he may see corruption (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>); but he will not behold (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) death. He will never know what death is (cf. here; <a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, where the Saviour speaks of the "living water," and "life eternal," and "living bread," which whoso partaketh shall never die.. See also <a href="../../par/john/11-26.htm">John 11:26</a>). He does not tell his disciples that they shall not see the grave, but that in the deepest sense they shall never die. "Death" and "life" are words that are lifted into a higher connotation. Death is a moral state, not an event in their physical existence.

The believer, even like the Lord, does <span class="accented">taste</span> of death (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), but he does not <span class="accented">see</span> it. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, is a rabbinical one for "drinking the cup of death" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>).

This claim to be Giver of immunity from death, and the further assumption that the belief of and continuance in his word would metamorphose and transfigure death itself, implied functions which "made" Jesus mightier, more august, than either Moses or Elijah, Abraham or the  prophets, who were dead.

He was not making himself to be anything. He was simply declaring the fact.

You do not know the only true God, you have not the knowledge which is life eternal. <span class="cmt_word">But I know him,</span> absolutely, intuitively, by the open eye of clearest consciousness, with invincible and perfect assent.

When our Lord, however, was broadly contrasting the Jewish knowledge of God with that of the Samaritans, and identifying himself with the Jews (<a href="../../par/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>), he uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">If I</span> <span class="cmt_word">should say that I know him not</span> - which I do not and dare not say.

The reality of the Father in his Divine-human consciousness, expressing itself through his human thought and word, was supreme, overmastering, sublime - <span class="cmt_word">I shall be, like you, a liar;</span> I should deceive you wilfully, as you are deceiving yourselves. We cannot fail here again to observe the severity of Jesus as portrayed in this Gospel. (There is nothing surely here, or in other numerous utterances in this discourse, inconsistent with the Son of Thunder.) No cowardly modesty (Lange) is possible to him. He knows, and must speak. He cannot, dare not, be silent, or allow these bitter enemies, with their ready malice and perverse and continuous misinterpretation of his words, to be ignorant, either of the ground of his self-consciousness or his penetration of their flimsy excuses. So once more he adds, <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">I know him, and keep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his word.</span> He will not allow this Divine consciousness to be taken from him, even by the shame and agony of the cross (Lange). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a></div><div class="verse">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i>it</i>, and was glad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - Christ then proceeds to the allegation that he was greater than Abraham, and exclaims, <span class="cmt_word">Abraham, your</span> <span class="cmt_word">father, exulted</span> (a word is used of tumultuous joy, <a href="../../par/luke/1-47.htm">Luke 1:47</a>) - triumphantly rejoiced <span class="cmt_word">that he should see my day</span> (so Revised Version, margin). Winer translates the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x1fc3;</span> in the same way, though that translation really means "exulted in the knowledge that he should see." The "rejoiced to see," of the Authorized Version and Revised Version, implies that, when he thus exulted, he had seen, which is not exactly compatible or consistent with the following clause. If Canon Evans's theory of the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament in the sense of "the contemplated result" be sound, we have a sufficient translation in "<span class="accented">exulted that he would or should see"</span> <span class="accented">my day.</span> In <a href="../../par/luke/17-22.htm">Luke 17:22</a> we hear of "one of the days of the Son of man." All those days seem gathered together in the expression, "my day," and can only mean the whole day of his manifestation as the incarnate Word - the day in which, through himself, God had visited his people. When did Abraham exult with so lofty an expectation and desire? Many times in solemn vision and by heavenly voice and holy promise Abraham was led to believe that in himself and in his seed all the nations of the world would be blessed (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). This promise made him young again. He staggered not at the promise of God. His  faith was counted for righteousness. He believed that God could and would do what seemed impossible. That which he rejoiced that he should see was the day of Christ, the revelation of the Father, and the way of life proffered to all nations. He anticipated a fulfilment of the promises to such an extent that he rejoiced in hope of the glory of God. So far thee is little difficulty. Our imagination easily pictures Abraham in the sacred tumult of a blessed hope concerning that which was eventually realized in the Messianic glory of the Lord Jesus. But our Lord added, <span class="cmt_word">He saw it, and was glad</span>. And the interpretations of this clause are very conflicting. Calvin asks whether this does not contradict <a href="../../par/luke/10-24.htm">Luke 10:24</a>, "Many kings and prophets desired to see the things which ye see, and yet did not see them." And he adds, "Faith has its degrees in beholding Christ. The ancient prophets beheld Christ at a distance, but not as present with them." We are reminded by others of <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>, "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen and greeted them from afar." Consequently, the only vision of the day of Christ vouchsafed to Abraham was the far off prophetic glance. This interpretation ignores the difference of two clauses, "exulted that he would see," and "saw it, and was glad." This second clause is supposed by Hengstenberg and others to refer to the vision of the angel of the Lord, the Logos (<a href="../../par/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>.), or to the revelation of the vicarious death and resurrection of Messiah in the sacrifice of Isaac (so Chrysostom and Erasmus). Others, again, have laid emphasis on the "birth of Isaac" as the fulfilment of promises previously made to his faith. Isaac was regarded as "heir of the world," and the embodiment of the Messianic hope. He was the child of promise, of the Spirit rather than of the flesh. This view has been urged by Hofmann, Wordsworth, Westcott. The proper sense was, doubtless, that, since the Lord became incarnate, Abraham's exulting hope has been realized; that which he desired and rejoiced in anticipation to see has now dawned upon him. This becomes an emphatic revelation by our Lord in one palmary case, and therefore presumably in other instances as well, of the relation and communion between the glorified life of the saints, and the events and progress of the kingdom of God upon earth. A great consensus of commentators confirms this in terpretation - Origen, Lampe, Lucke, De Wette, Godet, Meyer, Stier, Alford, Lange, Watkins, Thoma. It is objected that this kind of information about the invisible world is contrary to the manner of Christ, and would stand alone. This objection, however, ignores, and especially in the case of Abraham, other references by our Lord to the same idea and fact. The parable, so called, of the rich man and Lazarus, introduces Abraham as having been acquainted, during their lifetime, with the condition of the two dead men (see <a href="../../par/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22-25</a>). And when our Lord, in conflict with the Sadducees, would prove from Scripture and the language of Jehovah in the "passage concerning the bush" that the dead rise, he said, "Since God called himself the God of <span class="accented">Abraham</span>, Isaac, and Jacob, he was not the God of the dead, but of the living;" therefore Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were living, and not dead (<a href="../../par/luke/20-36.htm">Luke 20:36-38</a>). In like manner, Moses and Elijah are represented as conversing with Jesus concerning the decease (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) he was about to accomplish (<a href="../../par/luke/9-30.htm">Luke 9:30, 31</a>). St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>) declares that the angels desire to look into the mysteries of human redemption. St. Paul tells us that the principalities and powers in heavenly places receive fresh illustration of the manifold wisdom of God by and from the Church on earth (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>). So that the idea is one in harmony with many other lines of Divine revelation. Abraham rejoiced at the advent of Christ. He has seen it, and been gladdened. The angels sang their praises at the birth of Christ, and rejoiced over one penitent sinner (<a href="../../par/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>.). The patriarchs also rejoice that the promises which they handed down to the generations that would follow them have been fulfilled. The 'Midrash' declares, says Wunsche, that Abrabam saw the Law giving on Sinai, and rejoiced at it. Westcott says the "tense" is decisive against this joy of Abraham in Paradise. But the aorist simply calls attention to the effect at once produced upon the consciousness of Abraham as soon as he became aware of the day of the Son of man. Rabbinical ideas of the knowledge communicated to Abraham concerning the career of his descendants, confirm and illustrate this interpretation; while the light thus cast upon the darkness of the grave expounds the great statement, "He that continueth in [keepeth] my word shall not see death." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-57.htm">John 8:57</a></div><div class="verse">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews, therefore, said unto him</span> - once more misinterpreting his words, and giving a materialistic tone to his Divine hint - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast not yet fifty years</span> - "Thou art not fifty years old" - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> Christ did not <span class="accented">say</span> that be had seen Abraham, but that Abraham had seen and rejoiced in his day. The Jews chose to regard the language of Jesus as adding another immense improbability, if not falsehood, to his previous claims, viz. that he had actually lived to twice the age of Methuselah already. The "fifty years old" may  have been simply used in round numbers for the age of man's prime and completed life (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>). There may have been, even if our Lord was only thirty-three years of age at the time of his Passion, that which <span class="accented">apparently</span> added to his years. A tradition is mentioned (Irenaeus, 100, 2, 22. 5) of the more advanced age of Jesus which the Ephesian presbyters preserved, and which Irenaeus regards as between the forty-fifth and fiftieth years. Ernest de Bunsen vainly finds a reference to Christ's age (<a href="../../par/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>) in the forty-six years of the temple; but it is strange that, with the exception of the statement in <a href="../../par/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>, there is nothing in the extraneous chronological data, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the death of Herod and recall of Pontius Pilate, which need positively compress our Lord's life within fifty years (Westcott). And Keim has made the suggestion that our Lord did carry on his ministry for a much longer period than is commonly supposed. It is far more probable, however, that the Jews were using an expression for the term of a completed life, and were supplying no chronological data whatever. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - The reply of Jesus to this taunt is one of the most surprising and baffling kind on any hypothesis of our Lord's consciousness being limited as that of all other of the sons of men. He gives the solemn emphasis of the <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> once more - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born</span> (came into being), <span class="cmt_word">I am.</span> Abraham came into existence by birth (the Vulgate translates, <span class="accented">Antequam fierat Abraham Ego sum</span>): <span class="accented">I am.</span> Numerous attempts have been made to explain this climacteric utterance on some humanistic theory. The contrast is very remarkable between <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. Jesus Christ declared his own timeless existence to have been in his consciousness before Abraham came into being at all. The "I am" reminds us repeatedly, when used by Jesus, of the "I AM THAT I AM" of <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, and the "thou art" of <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>. (89:2, LXX.); Psalms 102:28. His human consciousness gave utterance to the awful depths of the eternal Ego. Now, some critics have limited it in its meaning to "I existed in the counsel of God." But there are three objections to this interpretation: one is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the present tense, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span>, and not the past, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, was used by our Lord; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> on this interpretation Abraham must have also equally pre-existed in the counsel of God; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> such a statement would throw no light on the previous discourse. The Racovian Confession of Faith, based on the view of Socinus, explains, "Before Abram becomes Abraham, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the father of many nations, I am it, the Messiah, the Light of the world." Not until my Messianic claims are acknowledged, and the many nations become children of Abraham, does Abraham really become Abraham, does his name derive its full meaning. This would be rabbinical trifling (J.P. Smith, 'Script. Test. to Messiah,' vol. 2). Beyschlag thinks that our Lord realized in his Person not a conscious pre-existence before Abraham, or before all worlds, but an impersonal principle, the image of God, which could only "be" in the eternal mind of God. There is a sense in which every man may realize such pre-existence as this, not merely "the Son of God," nor the new man in Christ, but every man whatsoever; but such a statement is entirely out of harmony with the whole passage that precedes. If the Jews had understood it in this sense, they would not have taken up stores to stone him, but, after their wont, would have said, "So also were we." "Ideas do not see one another." The first <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span> (ver. 12) brought out their angry unbelief, but this excites their murderous assault. We have to observe that this remarkable expression does not stand alone. St. John had reasons for saying "that the Word was with God, and was God. and was made flesh" (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 3, 14</a>). If Jesus, in his Divine consciousness, had never elsewhere spoken of having had a <span class="accented">being</span> before his <span class="accented">manifestation</span> (<a href="../../par/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46, 62</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), of having taken part with the Father from the beginning (<a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), of being "one with the Father" (<a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30, 33</a>), of being greater than the temple or the sabbath, as being the Object of the eternal love in coming down from heaven, in laying down his life that he might take it again (<a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>); and if the language of the apostles (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>) had not entirely prepared our mind for the data on which such conclusions rested, a generation before this Gospel was reduced to form, we might join the effort to resist such a claim as that of eternal pre-existence. But the whole tenor of the Gospel and the entire New Testament teaching are seen, more and more, to turn upon this fundamental position - that in Christ dwells all the fulness of the Godhead, that he had life in himself, and eternity, and that the manhood has not only been lifted to the highest place in human remembrance, but to the midst of the throne.

That which had been proclaimed as a great truth of his Being and mission, viz. that he was the Light of the world, was now to be established and confirmed to the disciples by a signal miracle. The "higher criticism" finds explanation of this and other similar miracles at Bethsaida and Jericho, in the prophecy of <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>.

He was obviously a well-known beggar, who had often proclaimed the fact that he was blind from birth (see ver. 8). Such a condition and history rendered the cure more difficult and hopeless in the view of ordinary <span class="accented">professors</span> of the healing art, and the juxtaposition of such a symbolic fact with the near activity of those who were boasting of their Abrahamic privilege and their national and mere hereditary advantages, is one of the instances of the unconscious poesy of the gospel history. There he sits, the very type of the race which says, "We <span class="accented">see</span>," but which to Christ's eye was proclaiming its utter helplessness and blindness, not asking even to be illumined, and revealing the fundamental injury done to the very race and nature of man, and calling for all the healing power that he had been sent into the world to dispense. The man who had been struck blind, or whose eyesight had been slowly dosed by disease, became the type of the effect of special sins upon the character and life; thus <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">vanity</span> conceals radical defects and weaknesses; <span class="accented">pride</span> hides from the sinner's own view his own trans<span class="accented">gressions</span>; temporary blindness to great faults is one of the symptoms of <span class="accented">gross sin</span> like David's, and prejudice is proverbially blind and deaf; but here is a man who is nothing less than the type of a congenital bias to evil, of hereditary damage done to human nature. Unless Christ can pour light upon those who are <span class="accented">born</span> blind, he is not the Savior the world needs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi.</span> This honorific appellation is found in <a href="../../par/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 49</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-31.htm">John 4:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-25.htm">John 6:25</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-8.htm">John 11:8</a>; but very rarely in the other Gospels. It is applied to John the Baptist (<a href="../../par/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>). The question seems to denote a very different frame of mind from that with which the previous chapter terminated. <span class="cmt_word">Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</span> It was the current idea and popular doctrine, not only that all suffering in this life had its origin in sin, and was a witness to the damage done to our nature by sin, by the disruption of our normal relations with the living God, but furthermore that every peculiar disaster pointed to some special or particular sin. Doubtless the Book of Job was a formal discussion of the question. The writer of that work repudiates the right of any onlooker to infer special sins from peculiar punishments. Jesus, moreover (<a href="../../par/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-3</a>); had repeatedly discouraged the tendency to judge, but he did this by the still more solemn assurance that all men deserved the special fate of some. Still, the calamity of congenital blindness, with all its hopelessness, provided a very apt occasion for raising the question, "Who did sin, this man, or his parents?" It is and always will be difficult to say whether the disciples thought that they had exhausted the alternatives, or believed that they had plausible reasons for thinking either alternative possible. Some have argued that they had Scripture ground for the second of the suppositions, that the sin of the parents of the blind man was the real cause of the blindness of their son. Thus (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>) the idea is embedded in the Decalogue, and it is repeated in <a href="../../par/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>, that the iniquities of fathers are visited upon their children. The forty years in the wilderness was a case in point (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>), and numerous examples may be given of the punishment descending from parent to child; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, upon the house of Ahab, and on the sufferers from exile in Babylon. Compare the continuous threatening of vengeance for unfaithfulness upon the generation to come. The argument may have been strengthened by observation of the lot of men who have brought poverty, disease, and disgrace upon their unborn children. Ezekiel had deliberately repudiated the inference that Israel had drawn from their Scriptures, in the dictum or proverb (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>) that "the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge," and maintained with great and passionate earnestness, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." This may have led the disciples to put the conjectural solution. <span class="accented">Did this man sin?</span> Is there any way or sense in which the man's own sin could be the cause of so great a calamity? It seems entirely gratuitous to derive from this passage any final conclusion as to the method in which they supposed it possible that the man's personality preceded his birth, or any certain conviction that they meant more by their question than this - if sin is the cause of such fearful privation, it must either be the man's parents' or his own. It could not have been his own; was it then his parents'? There was sufficient discussion of the problem among the Jews for one or more vague and unsettled opinions to be floating in their minds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It cannot be proved that the doctrine of metempsychosis was ever held by the Jews. The language in which Josephus refers to the views of the Pharisees is ambiguous (cf. 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 14; 'Ant.,' 18:01. 3). The view held by them was simply that "the immortal souls of the good (only) pass into another body," are raised into a new life; "but that the souls of the sinful <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, are afflicted with eternal punishment." This differs profoundly from the Oriental, or Pythagorean, or Platonic doctrine of transmigration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Jewish speculation of the pre-existence of souls has some countenance from Wisd. 8:19, 20, where the pseudo-Solomon says, "I was a witty child, and... being good, I came into a body undefiled," modifying somewhat the Platonic idea of a harmony between the pre-existing soul and the body (see Grimm, 'Exeg. Handb.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.; Bruch, 'The Pre-existence of the Soul,' freely translated; American 'Bibliotheca Sacra:' 1863); but beyond this there is no sound indication that the Jewish mind had accepted the doctrine which played so great a part in the later discussions as to the views of Origen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Lightfoot ('Horae Hebraicae,' <span class="accented">in</span>, <span class="accented">loc</span>.) thinks "the dogma held by R. Akiba, commenting on Ecclesiastes 13:1, to the effect that "in the days of Messiah there will be neither merit nor demerit" - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that neither merit nor demerit of parents will be imputed to posterity - may account for the query of the apostles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The idea of the possible sinfulness of the child while in the womb of its mother - a theory based upon the supposed moral activity of Jacob and Esau in the womb of Rebecca ('Bemidbar Rab.,' fol. 230. 2), and the statement that John the Baptist leaped in the womb of his mother Elisabeth (<a href="../../par/luke/1-41.htm">Luke 1:41</a>) - may have co-operated with other vague views floating in their minds with sufficient intensity to explain the first part of their question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The supposition of some (Tholuck), that the disciples may have thought that the man's sins were foreknown, and that the blindness was punishment beforehand, is so abhorrent to any notion of the justice of God, that we cannot suppose that it ever entered into their inquiry. The fact that no fewer than five distinct hypotheses as to the possibility of culpability before birth having had some place in Hebrew and contemporary thought, is an adequate explanation of the fact that they should have put this ever-recurring problem of evil in the particular form in which we find it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents</span> (that he should be born blind). There was no immediate connection between the special sin of the parents and this particular calamity. Our Lord does not assert in those words the sinlessness of those people, but severs the supposed link between their conduct and the specific affliction before them. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (he was born blind) <span class="cmt_word">that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span> The disciples will soon see in the history of this man the meaning of his lifelong blindness. In the man himself' the grace of God will work mightily, both a bodily and spiritual illumination. Evil in this case is to redound to greater good. This provides no opportunity for any to fasten on one or another some charge of special transgression, but, as all evil ought to do, it provides opportunity for the redeeming work which Christ came to accomplish, and which he permitted his disciples to share. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span> <span class="cmt_word">must work the works of him that sent me</span>, <span class="cmt_word">while it is day.</span> The emendation of the text certainly throws much beauty into the statement. Christ identifies himself with his disciples. They are pledged by accepting his call, and he has been himself charged by his own sublime mission to work while it is called day. The sun was going down over the holy city on that sabbath day, and Jesus will not wait, nor lose the opportunity of doing the merciful will of the Father. He did not say, "Him that sent <span class="accented">us"</span> (as Tischendorf reads), for "As the Father had sent him, so <span class="accented">he</span> sent them." But he adds, <span class="cmt_word">The night cometh, when no man can work.</span> The materialistic  interpretation of Paulus, "Christ must have daylight for a delicate operation," is too puerile to deserve refutation. The suggestion of the Greek Fathers (Chrysostom, Theophylact, etc.), who here drew a distinction between the work of this world and the work of the future world, between work done before and after his Passion, representing the work of his earthly ministry as done in the day, and that of the Spirit as work done in the night, is singularly unfortunate. Our Lord is merely adopting the phrase as a customary image for life and death. Death puts an end to all human activity on earth, even to Christ's own, as a human Friend and Teacher. Numerous attempts have been made to suppose some emphatic contrast between the lifetime of Christ and the period that should follow his Passion. They all fail, because Christ's own activity resumes another form by his resurrection and the gift of his Spirit. The night of death, accompanied by the cessation of active labor, is the general idea. The day's work must be done in the day. The probation involved in the bare fact of its limitation, and in this case its rapidly approaching consummation, is the main thought, without pressing the imagery too far. By saying, "We must work," etc., he gave a lesson and an example for all time. The 'Pirke Aboth,' "The Sayings of the Fathers," record the words of R. Tryphon, "The day is short, and the task is great, and the workmen are sluggish, and the reward is much, and the Master of the house is urgent." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-5.htm">John 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While</span> - or, <span class="accented">whensoever - <span class="cmt_word"></span>I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.</span> He had said (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), "I am the Light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness." He was sublimely conscious of his power to do for the moral world what the sun was doing for the physical world. He was the Occasion of its life, the Condition of its activity, the means of its instruction, the Source of all its beauty, its joy, and its progress. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which is translated <span class="accented">quamdiu</span> in the Vulgate, and "so long as" in the Authorized Version, means strictly "whensoever," and refers to the entire period of his activity (see <a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). But while the sun of this world cannot open the eyes of the blind, and wastes his radiance on their sightless sockets, so, unless Christ were more than the <span class="accented">sun</span>, and could give the power as well as the opportunity of seeing, he would never have done the work of him that sent him. The fact that he is the Light leads him to remind the disciples that he is the true Source of eyesight as well as of the conditions of vision. Light enough for all the world shines into the darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not. This Jewish people are surrounded by floods of light. The spiritual world stands revealed fully to Christ's own gaze. But mankind hates the light, loves darkness on these matters rather than the light. There is a radical fundamental change that must come over men, or they will never <span class="accented">see</span>. This evil, this terrible calamity that has befallen man, will vitiate all the provision of mercy. There must be a new beginning, a new birth, a work of God wrought in men, as well as a sublime revelation made to men, or the whole mission of the Christ would be incomplete. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and with the</span> <span class="cmt_word">clay thereof anointed his</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">eyes</span> (of the blind man). The precise meaning and motive of the process here described has been a source of great perplexity to the commentators. We see that, on other occasions, our Lord used his own saliva as a means of cure (<a href="../../par/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23</a>). Theme finds in the spittle the symbol of the impurity of the man thus dealt with (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5, 6</a>), but somewhat inconsistently compares the "clay" with the "collyrium" of <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17-19</a>, and the "ausfiuss des Logos." On some occasions Jesus touched the diseased or deficient organ, put his hand on the leper, and his fingers in the ears of the deaf mute. On other occasions, again, he healed with his word only, and even from a distance, those who. in the freeness and royalty of his love, he elected to relieve from their sufferings. He was moved, doubtless, in every case by the 'special condition and temperament of the objects of his compassion. The use of these means was probably intended to evoke the nascent faith that predisposed him to receive healing, to stir the mind of the sufferer into some conscious relation will himself through those other powers of tactile sensitiveness which were in all similar cases singularly acute. Moreover, the virtue of saliva in cases of blindness was well understood. Lightfoot gives some curious proof of this, and Tacitus ('Hist.,' 4:81) and Suetonius ('Vesp.,' <a href="../../par/john/7.htm">John 7</a>.) both record the healing of a blind man by the Emperor Vespasian by the use of <span class="accented">jejuna saliva</span>. Pliny (' Hist. Nat.,' 28:7) speaks of the same remedy for the diseases of the eye. "Clay" also is spoken of as being sanative by a physician by name <span class="accented">Serenus Samonicus]PGBR> (see Tholuck, Wetistein, Lange, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). These ideas may have had some truth in them, and for the blind man to find the process described, applied to himself by One who spoke of the Divine operations being wrought in him, would work some powerful effect on his moral, physical, and spiritual nature. Such result our Lord intended to produce. But this was only part of the healing process.

There the Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, and rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of sheep-skins; that is, the pool that was used to wash sheep before shearing them, or even the tan-pit (so Schleusner and Hesych.)  - but it is rendered by <span class="accented">Siloe</span> in the Vulgate. Isaiah is contrasting the waters of the Shiloah, which flow softly, with the turbulent streams of the Tigris, which represented the pomp and power of this world. The sweet waters from the pool of Siloam still flow from their apparent source through what once were the king's gardens, into the Kedron near the junction of the Valley of Jehoshaphat with that which used to be called the Valley of the Son of Hinnom. Silwan is the Arabic name of the fountain and pool of Siloam, and also of the village on the opposite side of the valley. Nehemiah is referring, in all probability, to the same pool, the walls of which were in part the walls of the city itself on the lower spur of Mount Ophel, which is now finally determined to be the Zion of Scripture and the city of David. A "tower of Siloam" is also spoken of (<a href="../../par/luke/13-4.htm">Luke 13:4</a>). It is not necessary here to review the arguments in favor of this position, with its accompanying conclusion that the Tyropaeon, the valley of the cheesemongers, which separated Ophel and the temple-mount from the upper city, was the Valley of the Son of Hinnom (see 'Survey of Western Palestine,' pt. it. pp. 345-371; Professor Sayce on "Pre-Exilic Jerusalem" in Quarterly Statement of Palest. Explor. Fund' (1883), pp. 215; and 'Fresh Light from Ancient Monuments,' p. 98, etc.). The position of the fountain and pool of Siloam is one of the best-authenticated sites in Palestine (see Robinson's 'Biblical Researches,' 1:493-507). Sayce gives strong reasons for believing that it was made in the days of Solomon, and that the proceeding of Hezekiah, referred to in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, when he diverted the water from Gihon, and brought it to the west side of the city of David, was not on account (as Edersheim, Canon Birch, and others) of the formation of the zigzag tunnel from the Fountain of the Virgin, but referred to the formation of Colonel Warren's tunnel, by which the waters of the same fountain were made available within the city by drawing them further to the north-west, and reaching them by a flight of stairs that go down from the city of David (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>). He thinks that <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> is interpreted of the lower pool of Siloam. The contemporary references of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a>) apply only to the Siloam tunnel, the Siloam pool, and that lower pool, which was repaired by Hezekiah. The upper pool, and therefore the tunnel which supplied it, were known in the time of Ahaz. Josephus makes frequent reference to the fountain of Siloam, and expressly says that it was situated at the mouth of the Tyro-paeon. The 'Itin. Hier.' and Jerome both say that it was at the foot of Mount Zion (see especially Jerome's 'Comm. in Esa. 8:6'). Antoninus Martyr (in the seventh century), William of Tyre, Benjamin of Tudela (1165), and Phoeas (1185), all refer to it. This remarkable connection with the Fountain of Mary was known to Quaresmius in the seventeenth century, but not fairly discovered till Robinson entered it at both ends, and found that there was a direct subterranean communication between the so-called Fountain of the Virgin and the Fountain of Siloam. In 1881 the accidental discovery of an inscription in pure Hebrew, of uncertain <span class="accented">date</span>, describes the process of the excavation, and accounts for the false starts made by the two parties of excavators, who eventually met and discovered the different levels at which they had been working. Whenever made, whether by Solomon, Uzziah, Ahaz, or Hezekiah, it was obviously intended to bring fresh water within the walls of the city. The intermittent character of the flow of water in the Fountain of the Virgin, by which sometimes twice or thrice a day, and at other seasons twice or thrice a week, the water suddenly rises and disappears with gurgling sounds into the conduits made for its removal, was referred to by Jerome, as an eye and ear witness of the occurrence. We leave the question of the identification of the Fountain of the Virgin with any of the fountains mentioned in the Old Testament. The point of singular interest is that the waters of Siloam were in direct communication with the upper spring, which itself may be yet proved to be in relation to some more abundant supply of water in the temple-rock. Into the further intricacies of this problem it is unnecessary to enter. The pools of Siloam are still to be seen near the mouth of the Tyropaeon valley. The print of connection with the Fountain of the Virgin cannot be doubted, nor can the fact be disputed that from Siloam, during the Feast of Tabernacles, the sacred waters were brought in solemn procession and with sacred rite (see <a href="../../par/john/7.htm">John 7</a>.). Our Lord sent the blind man, thus startled into some receptivity of grace, to that which was the symbolic source of the water of life. He did this on the sabbath day, claiming cooperation with Jehovah in his truly sabbatic deed: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." Siloam had been already the type of that which Jesus was in reality, when he had cried and said, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink." Consequently, there is striking appositeness in the language of St. John here parenthetically introduced (<span class="cmt_word">which is, being interpreted, Sent</span>); <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> equivalent to <span class="accented">missio</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">mittit</span> or <span class="accented">missus</span>, which may be synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, viz. the strengthened participle Kal with passive signification. John is correct in his etymology. Siloam probably derived its name from the fact that its waters were <span class="accented">sent</span> from the higher sources, through known channels, with special significance as God's gift for the preservation of the life of the people, and the age-long memorial of his goodness. The old poet Nonnus, Euthymius, and Meyer see <span class="accented">here</span> a reference to the man who was "sent" thus to wash and be healed; but a host of commentators, from Theophylact, Calvin, Cornelius a Lapide, down to Luthardt, Godet, and Westcott, rightly urge that "Siloam," as meaning "Sent," was in John's thought emblematic of him who had so often spoken of himself as the Sent of God. The point of the parenthesis is that the very name of this healing and symbolic fountain is a type of Messiah, who thus identifies himself with the Heaven-sent gifts of the Divine hand. <span class="cmt_word">He then</span> (therefore) <span class="cmt_word">departed, and washed</span>. The blind man needed no guide to Siloam, and if he had clone so there would have been a score of helpers or curious on-lookers anxious to test the meaning of the Lord's command<span class="cmt_word">. And he came</span> away from Siloam<span class="cmt_word">, seeing</span>; in all the strange and wonderful excitement of a man who, with his first possession of this imperial sense, was moving indeed in a new world. The miracle, of course, provokes the critical school either into repudiating the supernatural element, or doubting the historical fact. Theme dreams through a world of parallels with the healing and apostleship of St. Paul.

The "Pharisees" is not a conclusive definition of the Sanhedrin itself, which is generally denoted by the addition of the phrase, "the chief priests" (<a href="../../par/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> or 45). The Pharisees were a highly organized society, and some well-known gathering of them may have been easily accessible. They were the generally accredited religious guides of the people. One thing militates against such a casual gathering. In ver. 18 the term, "the Jews," the synonym of the ruling ecclesiastical powers in the city, is once more introduced. Moreover, the authorities before whom the discussion and examination were taken appear to possess the power of excommunication from the synagogue. It appears that, in Jerusalem, there existed two minor councils or synagogue-courts, of twenty-three assessors each, corresponding with the similar courts in the Jewish cities, standing in relation to the Sanhedrim and possessing the faculty of delivering the minor degrees of excommunication from the congregation of Israel. It cannot be said that this presentation of the case to an ecclesiastical court of more or less authority necessarily took place on the day of the healing. It is an open question whether the courts sat on the sabbath. There is nothing to prove immediate trial of the matter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-14.htm">John 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it was sabbath on the day</span> <span class="cmt_word">that Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</span> The phrase is peculiar, and implies that the day may have been a festival sabbath. The introduction here shows that the difficulty of the neighbors and other friends had already been raised, and something more than a desire on their part for religious guidance actuated their appeal to the Pharisees. Why should the healed man be taken to the Pharisees, or the synagogue-court at all, unless some question of casuistry had been raised? The movement was one unquestionably adverse to Jesus. It could have had no other motive. Nor can any doubt arise that Jesus had violated the rabbinical rules of the sabbath, though his act had been in perfect harmony with the spirit and even letter of the Mosaic Law. The making of clay with the spittle and the sand was an infringement of the rule ('Shabbath,' 24:3). It was curiously laid down in one of the vexatious interpretations (preserved in Jerusalem Gemara on 'Shabbath,' 14) that while "<span class="accented">wine</span> could by way of remedy be applied to the eyelid, on the ground that this might be treated as washing, it was sinful to apply it to the inside of the eye" (Edersheim). And it was positively forbidden (in the same Gemara) to apply saliva to the eyelid, because this would be the application of a remedy. All medicinal appliances, unless in cases of danger to life or limb, were likewise forbidden. Consequently, the Lord had broken with the traditional glosses on the Law in more ways than one (see Winer, 'Bibl. Realw.,' 2:346; Lightfoot, ' Ad Joan. 9; 'Wetstein on <a href="../../par/matthew/12-9.htm">Matthew 12:9</a>; Wunsche, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-15.htm">John 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again therefore the Pharisees</span>, before whom the blind man had been brought, unwilling to rest with mere hearsay evidence of such grievous transgression of the Law, <span class="cmt_word">themselves also</span> - or, <span class="accented">in their turn</span>  - <span class="cmt_word">asked him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, imperfect, were interrogating) <span class="cmt_word">how he received</span> (recovered) <span class="cmt_word">his sight</span> (see note on ver. 11). Not the miracle itself, but the manner of it interested and excited them. <span class="cmt_word">And he said to them, (He) put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see</span>. This is a shorter and significant abridgment of the process already described. The healed man seems to guess, by their manner, that some charge was being meditated against his Benefactor, and he shrewdly omits the <span class="accented">saliva</span> and the <span class="accented">making</span> of the clay, and the order of the Savior, and the place whither he had been sent to wash. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.

This, in their opinion, is another offence against the Law, after serious warning. The previous controversy (<a href="../../par/john/5.htm">John 5</a>.) had produced no effect upon Jesus. He continued, in their opinion, to invalidate all his claims by violating the sabbath laws, which they had brought to the highest point of perfection. Renan and others insist on Christ's repeated violation of the sabbath; but the fact is that the Lord sustained the highest meaning of the sabbath, though he resolutely repudiated the inhuman glosses and manifest absurdities of the traditionary customs and rabbinical rules. Jesus could not be, they thought (or argued), "from God," invested with his authority, or doing his works, so tong as he would not take their view of the sabbath. This Jesus is making obstinate assault upon their prejudices. On seven distinct occasions the Lord chose to heal on the sabbath, and thus to set the restrictions of august rabbis at defiance. But even in the great Sanhedrin, in the highest council of the nation, sat men of the character of Joseph, Nicodemus, and Gamaliel, who would get some idea of the Divine commission of Jesus from the simple fact of the miracles. In this smaller court the opponents of Christ ignore and doubt the miracle itself, on account of the unsabbatic heresy, while a few are convinced that signs of this kind (and probably they had many in their minds) were in themselves proof of Divine co-operation and approval. <span class="cmt_word">But others said, How can a man that is a sinner</span> (on your hypothesis) <span class="cmt_word">do such signs</span>? "As far as they go, these miracles are demonstrative proof that at least God must be with him, as he has said, and they make it extremely doubtful whether he can be a bad man after all - can have verily broken the Divine Law." Such a speech as this from Pharisees is an emphatic proof of the profound effect produced by Jesus upon the life of the nation. It stands in close association with the remarkable statement of Nicodemus (<a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), "We know that no man can do these miracles (signs) which thou art doing, except God be with him." Jesus and rabbinism are here face to face. Either <span class="accented">he</span> is from God and <span class="accented">they</span> are actually making the Law of God void and vapid by their traditions, or they and their code are from God and he, having broken with them, has broken with God, and the miracle will turn out to he magic or falsehood, collusion or worse. Thus a solemn crisis of profound importance occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And there was a division</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, cutting into two parties) <span class="cmt_word">amongst them.</span> These opposite effects and conclusions are the confirmation of the words of the prologue (<a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5, 11, 12</a>), and they further triumphantly refute the charge that the author of the Gospel was actuated by an untiring hostility to the kingdom and polity of the ancient Israel.

"What explanation hast thou to offer? What view dost thou entertain of the Man himself? Some of us think that his trifling with the sabbatic law puts out of court the idea of any Divine aid having enabled him to work this marvel. Other some, as you see, declare that the fact which has occurred is proof that Jesus must have had God's approval, and be sustained by Divine grace. But what dost thou, the healed man, say? What conclusion hast thou adopted? Seeing that he has opened thine eyes, what sayest <span class="accented">thou</span> of Jesus?" There is a bare chance that the man might give a vague answer, or one which would minimize the miracle. It is obvious that, while the Pharisees were contradicting each other and in danger of open collision, the faith of the blind man who had received his sight became stronger. The light was dawning on him. The answer, so far as it went, boldly took the side of Jesus, and perhaps its cue from the language of those who had said, "How can a bad man do such signs as these?" <span class="cmt_word">And he said, He is a Prophet</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>). Prophets, as divinely sent men, are even more authoritative than learned rabbis. If Jesus has broken through some of these restrictions by which they have "placed a hedge about the Law," surely he had a prophetic right to do it. The healing marks a Divine commission, and the healed man owned and freely confessed to so much as this: "He is a Prophet." Maimonides (quoted by Dr. Farrar) shows that the idea was current that <span class="accented">a prophet</span> might, on his own <span class="accented">ipse dixit</span>, alter or relax even the sabbath law, and that then the people were at liberty to obey him.

The Talmud speaks of three kinds of excommunication (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>), of which the first two were disciplinary; the third answers to complete and final expulsion (in 'Jeremiah Moed. K.,' 81, d, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dc;</span>, Edersheim). The general designation was <span class="accented">shammata</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to destroy. The first form of it was called <span class="accented">nesephah</span>, and did not amount to more than severe rebuke. It would exclude from religious privileges for seven or thirty days, according to the dignity of the authority by whom it was pronounced (cf. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1</a>). The second form of <span class="accented">shammata</span> was called <span class="accented">niddui</span>, which lasted for thirty days at the least, and might be repeated at the end of them. If these admonitions failed to produce their right effect, it might lead to the third and final excommunication, called <span class="accented">cherem</span>, or ban, whose duration was indefinite. The second of these forms was accompanied by blast of trumpet and terrible curses, which deprived the sufferer of all kinds of social intercourse. He was avoided as a leper; if he died, he was buried without funeral or mourning. The <span class="accented">cherem</span> was even a more terrible anathema, and might last for life. The parents of the blind man might easily fear such a curse. The ban to which this blind man was eventually exposed did not prevent him from moving about the city. The ban pronounced on Jesus led doubtless to the condemnation, issuing in his ignominy and trial for a capital offence. It was probably the second of the three forms of anathema to which he was ultimately condemned. It was quite sufficient temptation for these poor parents to have preserved an obstinate reticence.

Moulton says, "A formula used when a criminal who was thought to be concealing the truth was being urged to make a full confession." Luthardt, Lampe, and others rightly observe that this adjuration theory, though it suits <a href="../../par/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>, does not fit <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a> or <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>, and that the Pharisees rather wished the man to give glory direct to God, and not to Jesus.

They add, <span class="cmt_word">We know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) absolutely, on theologic grounds beyond the comprehension of the poor man, and we can sustain it with all the weight of our tradition and custom - we <span class="accented">know</span> that this <span class="cmt_word">Man is a sinner.</span> They give no reference, and do not condescend to particulars.

Moses was made a little lower than the angels. God spake to him on Sinai, and from the mercy-scat, and face to face as a man speaketh with his friend (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). The most august ideas and associations clustered round his venerable name. Jesus was supposed to have challenged the supreme authority of Moses, and no sort of comparison could be drawn, in their opinion, between the two. <span class="cmt_word">But  as for this Man, we know not whence he is</span>. It is remarkable that, in <a href="../../par/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27</a>, they had been equally explicit in declaring, "We know whence he <span class="accented">is</span>." Then they thought to discredit iris Messianic claim by drawing a distinction between the well-known parentage and home of Jesus, and the coming of Messiah from some undiscoverable source, some hidden place, where God retained him before his revelation to Israel (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27, 28</a>). While, however, Christ (<a href="../../par/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>) allowed the validity of their superficial knowledge on that occasion, he declared that he alone knew whence he came and whither he was going (see notes, <a href="../../par/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>). It is, perhaps, in reference to this last expression that they echo his own words. The supernatural source of his being and teaching seemed to their minds, throughout that discourse and controversy, to vacillate between the Divine and the demonic. The contrast between Moses and Jesus in this bitter speech runs along the same low level. "We know not whence" he derives his prophetic character, or his right to legislate for the people of God.

The man rises into holy and eloquent wrath. Their entire history, their principles of judging of a prophetic call, the whole modus of Divine revelation, ought to have shown that one whose simple will stood in such vivid juxtaposition with work which none but Almighty God could do, ought to have enlightened them. "The blind man, finding he was argued with, grew bolder, and began to argue in turn; if he had not studied theology (say rabbinical casuistry and Mishnaic accretions to the Divine Law), he at least knew his catechism" (Godet).

One aspect of Old Testament teaching shows that a man must delight himself in the Lord in order to receive the desires of his heart. If we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us; but the prayer of the sinner, the desire of the wicked, is contrary to the will of' God. When the sinner turns from his sins to the Lord, the cry for mercy is in harmony with the will of God. In one sense every prayer is the prayer of sinful men; but it is the Divine life working within them that offers acceptable prayer. The prayer of the sinner as such is not heard. We know God does not listen to the cry of sinners, when, as sinners, they ask from the ground of their sin, to secure their own sinful purpose; <span class="cmt_word">but if any man be a worshipper of God</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), <span class="cmt_word">and doeth his</span> (God's) <span class="cmt_word">will, this man he heareth</span>.

The immediate application was the miraculous unwonted event as answer to the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man (see <a href="../../par/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16-18</a>). So much for the general relation of this Healer to God. The rabbis were never tired of urging that the "answers to prayer depended on a man being devout and doing the will of God" (Edersheim, who quotes 'Ber.,' 6, b; 'Taanith,' 3:8; 'Succah,' 14, a; 'Yoma,' 28, a). So that the man was here fighting with drawn sword.

The miracle stands forth with grand distinctness on the page of history. If such stories had been told, neither he nor the author of this narrative knew of them. The Pharisees and Jews have no reply to this burst of grateful but indignant testimony to the uniqueness of his Deliverer, and then, with a home-thrust which cut through their weak objections and repudiated their cruel inferences, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Unless this Man were from God, he could do nothing</span>; he could neither have wrought this marvel, nor any of the deep impressions wrought upon you. "From God;" that is the man's final answer to the query, "What sayest thou of him, seeing that he hath opened thine eyes?" God has the glory, while I repudiate what you give as a judgment against him. Verily God has heard him as One who in this thing has simply done his will.

They take up the superstitious idea which seems (ver. 2) to have been floating in the mind of the disciples. From sins of parents or from thine own sins in thy mother's womb, thou earnest into the world with the brand of thy infamy upon thee. Thus they admit the change that has come over him by reverting to the peculiar depravity which had been stamped upon his brow, according to their narrow interpretation of Divine providence. <span class="cmt_word">And dost thou presume to teach us?</span> - the chosen, the learned, the approved ministers of God?

We are not told that there and then they excommunicated, or unsynagogued, him. It is probable that this ban followed, with the usual terrible formalities. He had practically confessed that the highest claims which Jesus had ever made about himself were true, and he made himself liable to the curse already pronounced (ver. 22). This marvelous narrative, with its lifelike detail, is not made the text of a discourse. It remains forever the startling vindication of our Lord's own word, that he was Light to the world and Eyesight too, and was able to supply both the objective condition and subjective change by which the nature of man could alone receive the light of life. From ver. 8 to ver. 34 is almost the only passage in the Gospel, with the exception of the passage, <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22-36</a>, in which we are not standing in the actual presence of the Lord, or are not listening to his judgments on men and things, and to his revelations of the mystery of his own Person. The narrative so far stands by itself, and gives us an insight into the life which was being enacted in Jerusalem contemporaneously with the Divine self-revelation of Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-35.htm">John 9:35</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-41.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(10)</span> <span class="accented">The issues of the ministry of light</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-38.</span> - (a) The <span class="accented">vision of those who see not</span>. These verses narrate the sequel so far as the man was concerned. Westcott and others rather exaggerate the bearing of it when they say here was "the beginning of the new society." "The universal society is based on the confession of a new truth" (Westcott). Even in this Gospel the first chapter shows that Jesus gathered disciples about him who from that time onward were to "see angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man." In the second and fourth chapters he "made and baptized disciples." The twelve (<a href="../../par/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.) would not leave him in the midst of widespread disaffection, because they confessed that he was "the Holy One of God," who had "the words of eternal life." Consequently, it is enough to say that, when the authorities of the Jewish <span class="accented">ecclesia</span> excluded the disciple of Christ, the Lord admitted him to a nobler fellowship; but the fellowship, the society, had been already formed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus heard that they had east him out</span>; or, <span class="accented">thrust him forth</span>. Jesus is represented as "hearing," not from the man's own lips, but from the current report. He is not said to have become acquainted with the circumstance by intuition, but to have heard by the ordinary processes of knowledge. This simple touch shows how consistent the writer is throughout with the main thesis of his Gospel touching the perfect humanity of the Son of God, that he "was made flesh." and had "come in the flesh," though he was "from God." The excommunication noisily and widely bruited was further proof of the war to the knife between "the Jews" and Jesus. The man has fallen under the ban for practically avowing in the most public way that Jesus was "the Prophet," if not the Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And having found him</span>. So, then, the Lord, as the good Shepherd, sought out the lost sheep in the wilderness, and did not rest until he found him. The daylight that had made an altogether new world for one who had aforetime never looked on human face, had been strangely checkered and shadowed. He only saw angry faces and averted glances, and even his cowardly parents would have hesitated to receive him into their poor abode; but Jesus found him, <span class="cmt_word">and said, Dost thou believe on the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of God</span>? Not "Dost thou wish to believe?" but "Dost thou put thy trust in the Son of God?" Dost thou recognize the fact that the Messiah of the nation's hope has come? Art thou believing in him? It would be more natural that the more current appellation <span class="accented">Son of God</span>, rather than the more recondite idea of <span class="accented">Son of man</span>, should have been held out before the healed man. The "thou" is emphatic, and contrasts the state of the mind of this man with that of "the Jews." He had declared that his Healer was "from God," that he was "a Prophet," One who "did God's will," and whom "God heareth," even when he asked for apparently impossible things. Christ tests the quality and caliber of his faith. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-36.htm">John 9:36</a></div><div class="verse">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered and said,</span> <span class="cmt_word">And who is he, that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I may believe on him?</span> The conjunction adds much to the eagerness of the reply. His faith was ready for full expression. He half suspected, as the Samaritan woman (<a href="../../par/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>) did, that Jesus was pointing to himself. The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>; rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>; ("who?" rather than "what?") shows the intensity of the man's desire to find and hail and trust "the Son of God." The disposition, the posture, of his mind is that of faith. The adequate object for that faith has not been revealed to him. Apt symbol of many in their passage from darkness to light. When receptive, susceptible, conscious of need, with some notion, though an obscure one, of whom and of what they most of all need, many are disposed even now to utter the same importunate request. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">[And</span><span class="cmt_word">] Jesus said, Thou hast both seen him</span>, with the eyes so recently opened. Hast thou not found out that I am thy Healer, thy Prophet, thy Messiah? The <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> refers to the <span class="accented">present</span> interview, not to any previous one; for we are not told that he had already sought or found his Benefactor (Lucke, Meyer, Luthardt). Thou hast seen him with the eyes of thy spirit as well as the eyes of flesh, <span class="cmt_word">and</span>, in addition, <span class="cmt_word">he that talketh with thee,</span> familiarly as man with man<span class="cmt_word">, is he</span> - "that sublime Person who seems to stand far off from thought and experience" (Westcott). The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of this passage and <a href="../../par/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a> also is a fairly classical usage for expressing, in the lips of the speaker, a reference to himself pointed at and presented objectively as a third person (see Meyer, and our note on John 19:35, and its bearing on the authorship of the Gospel). Nowhere does our Lord more openly admit that he as the Christ, the Son of God. The disciples scarcely rise beyond the climax of this revelation even on the night of the Passion. The man's faith was waiting for its Object, and the vision comes to his unscaled spiritual vision. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-38.htm">John 9:38</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Lord, I believe</span> - the <span class="accented">Kyrie</span> means more than in ver. 36 - <span class="cmt_word">and he worshipped him</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used by John for homage paid to God (<a href="../../par/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-20.htm">John 12:20</a>; and twenty-three times in the Revelation, always in the sense of "worship"). This prostration, when no prayer was offered, no forgiveness asked, but a simple act of faith exercised, was nothing less than the highest homage the man could pay. The adoration of this man is a fitting climax to the scene (<a href="../../par/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>), and anticipates that of Thomas (<a href="../../par/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>). The higher significance of the Sonship dawned upon him in the unearthly tone and manner of the Lord. These scenes, and the offer of Divine homage unrebuked by Jesus and uncommented upon by the evangelist, are among the most potent arguments for the belief of the Church in the Divine nature of the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39-41.</span> - (b) <span class="accented">The blindness of those who are satisfied with their twilight</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - The sight of the man, enlightened and prostrate in adoring gratitude, led Jesus, in the face of the bystanders, with Pharisees among them (ver. 40), to declare the general effects which would follow from his entire self-manifestation (so Meyer, Godet). Westcott says, "Not to any one or group, but as interpreting the scene before him." A sublime monologue. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said, I came for judgment</span>. Not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> execute judgment, but <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, with a view to bring about a judicial decision on the moral condition of mankind (see notes on John 3:17, 18; 5:22, 23; 8:11, 15, 16) as a matter of fact. "This is the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, that men love darkness rather than light." Christ came to save - that was his supreme purpose; but to the Son is given the whole <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> will follow the revelation of the Son of God. He is the Touchstone of humanity. What men think of Christ is the question which decides in every age their moral condition before God. <span class="cmt_word">Into this world</span> of sin and strife, of crossing lights and strange delusions, of ignorance and superstition (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is different when <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is added; see <a href="../../par/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>) - not the world as the mere cosmos, or the sphere of creative activity, nor even the whole of humanity as <a href="../../par/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, but humanity viewed in its separation from grace, and in all its need - <span class="cmt_word">in order that they who see not might see</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not those who merely feel that they cannot see (as Lucke, Meyer, etc.), but the practically blind - the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, those who are sitting in darkness, with the capacity for sight, but not the opportunity; who cannot, as a matter of fact, apart from the revelation of new light, see the face of God; the babes to whom the Lord of heaven and earth has been pleased to unveil himself (see <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>); the poor in spirit, who do not but now may see the kingdom, and the pure in heart ready to behold their God. So far the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> declares itself to be a blessed consummation  - sight to the blind, cleansing to the leper, life to the dead. Even the man born blind suns himself in the heaven of the Savior's smile. The Light of the world shines upon them, and they see. But Christ's coming brings out also the character of those, and pronounces judgment on those, who say of themselves, "<span class="accented">We</span> see;" "<span class="accented">We</span> have never been in bondage," "We need no repentance;" "<span class="accented">Abraham</span> is our father;" "<span class="accented">We</span> know the Law;" "Who (nevertheless) do not come to the Light;" who are not "of the truth;" and the beaming of his unappreciated glory involves in their case, <span class="cmt_word">that those who see might become blind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), incapable of seeing. Those who have the knowledge of the Law, "<span class="accented">the</span> wise and prudent" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>), who boast their freedom, their knowledge, their advantages, their profession, may, nay do, by resolute turning away from "<span class="accented">the</span> Light of this world," lose their power of spiritual vision. But the unsophisticated, needy, even the publicans and harlots, consciously sitting in the region of the shadow of death, do by faith and repentance find that the great Light has unawares shone upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-40.htm">John 9:40</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Those of the Pharisees who were with him</span>. This expression does not simply mean who were near him at that moment, but who were to a certain extent siding with him (<a href="../../par/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30, 31</a>), while criticizing and rejecting his message; who were incensed with him for promising to them "freedom" and sonship, and whose faith in his claims was of the most superficial and vacillating kind. These wavering, self-satisfied Pharisees <span class="cmt_word">heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also</span>? Many commentators, who call attention to the contrast between the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 39, think that the speakers who made use of this word did not draw the distinction, and meant nothing more than their use <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> by of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. But this is unsatisfactory; whatever it 'means in the one clause, it ought to mean in the other. There is a difference between "<span class="accented">becoming blind</span>," and being "the <span class="accented">blind</span>." They ask whether <span class="accented">they</span> are <span class="accented">blind also</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as blind as those who have, according to Christ's own dictum, <span class="accented">become</span> so. They seem to admit that some who have the power of sight have  been blinded by the very light that shines upon them, but they are in doubt with reference to their own case. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - The reply of our Lord is not meant to be a crushing and final retort, condemning them to hopeless night, but was obviously intended to show them that they are not yet free from <span class="accented">sin</span>, that they are only partially appreciating the light which shines upon them. <span class="cmt_word">If ye were blind</span> - incapable of sight; if ye had all along been deprived of the faculty of perceiving the true Light that shineth in the darkness (a condition of things which would have emancipated them from responsibility, and which Christ would not admit to be the case); perhaps more, if ye had been utterly blind to the light which is shining upon you now, which, however, is not true - <span class="cmt_word">ye would not have sin</span>. This is akin to the solemn language of <a href="../../par/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22-24</a>. They did not themselves admit that there was any congenital blindness about them. They did not pretend or expect to ride off on such a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, such an excuse. Could they be, judicially or naturally, blind? The very idea was an absurdity, and so Jesus added, <span class="cmt_word">But now ye say, We see.</span> You even boast that you are "instructors of the ignorant, and leaders of the blind; a light to those who sit in darkness, having the form of knowledge and truth in the Law" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-21</a>). You are the very opposite of the "not-seeing" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); you are self-satisfied; you will not come to the Light. What is the issue? The Lord seems to pause before his answer (the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, "therefore," is rejected by the best manuscripts and critics): <span class="cmt_word">Your sin abideth</span>; or, <span class="accented">remaineth</span>. It will remain until you fully admit the great principle and reason, the motive and characteristics, of my mission. The very facility you profess, the intimacy you claim with the Law and its founder, and your partial knowledge of my claim, take away your excuse. The discourse which follows shows how entire must be the submission to Christ, how complete the union with him, of those who say, "We see." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../john/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="John 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../john/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="John 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
