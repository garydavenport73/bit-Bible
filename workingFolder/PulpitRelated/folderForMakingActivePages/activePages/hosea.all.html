The comparison of Israel to a vine is frequent; but the epithet <span class="accented">boqeq</span> is variously rendered; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "empty." Thus Aben Ezra explains it as "empty in which there is no strength to bring forth fruit, nor fruit;" and thus also Kimchi explains it: "An empty vine in which there is not any life-sap;" and in the same sense <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, "empty and sick," <a href="../../par/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>. This, too, is the meaning of the Authorized Version, but is irreconcilable with the statement in the following clause, "he bringeth forth fruit." The Chaldee had preceded in giving the word the sense of "plundered," "empty," "waste." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some take <span class="accented">boqeq</span> transitively, and attach to it the signification of "emptying out its fruit." In this way Rashi explains it: "The Israelites resemble a vine which casts all its good fruit;" and similarly the marginal rendering of the Authorized Version has, "a vine emptying the fruit which it giveth." There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a signification derivable from the primary meaning of <span class="accented">boqeq</span> more suitable than either of the preceding. From the primary sense of "pouring," "pouring itself out," or" poured out," and so overflowing, comes that of "luxuriant." Accordingly Gesenius translates, "a wide-spreading vine." This agrees with the <span class="accented">Septuagint</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "a vine with goodly branches," to which the Vulgate <span class="accented">frondosa</span>, "leafy," nearly corresponds. In like manner De Wette renders it <span class="accented">wuchernder</span>, "growing prosperously." It was thus a vine of vigorous growth, and extending its branches far and wide; a parallel expression is found in the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>, "a spreading vine." He (rather, <span class="accented">it</span>) bringeth forth fruit unto him self (<span class="accented">itself</span>). The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>literally signifies "reset to" or "on," and is rightly rendered by Gesenius "to set" or "yield fruit." It is variously interpreted by the Hebrew commentators, but more or less erroneously by them all. Rashi takes it in the sense of "to profit;" Aben Ezra, "to bear" or "make equal;" and Kimchi informs us that the older interpreters understood in the sense of "lying," as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, the whole phrase meaning, "the fruit will lie to him," that is, deceive or fail him (like <a href="../../par/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>). Kimchi himself takes the verb in the right sense, but, misled by his erroneous explanation of <span class="accented">boqeq</span>, empty or plundered, takes the clause interrogatively: "How shall he set on himself [equivalent to 'yield' any fruit], since he is as a plundered vine; for the enemies have plundered him and set him as an empty vessel? how should he still thrive and become numerous in children and treasures?" It makes little difference whether we take the second part of the first clause relatively or independently, as the sense amounts to the same. The meaning of the two difficult and disputed words then we take to be respectively "luxuriant" and "yield;" and the sense of the whole is either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a comparison of the former state of Israel to a vine luxuriant and likely, as far as appearance went, to set forth fruit; but the luxuriance degenerated into leafage, and the likelihood of fruitage failed; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Israel is compared to a vine luxuriant in growth and abundant in fruit - but only <span class="accented">for itself</span>. The former explanation accords with that of Jerome when he <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Unpruned</span> vines luxuriate in the juice and leaves which they ought to transmute into wine. They disperse in the idle ambitious show of leaves and branches." The more abundantly a fruit tree gives out its strength in leaves and branches, the less abundant and the worse the quality of the fruit. Thus it was with the fig tree, with its abundant leaves and no fruit, which our Lord cursed. But with the same or a similar rendering there is the alternative sense of prosperous growth and plenteous fruit, but that fruit wasted on self or sin; and thus the meaning in either case is much the same. The Septuagint favors this by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "its fruit exuberant." Cyril favors this latter also in saying, "When Israel still wisely led a life in accordance with the Divine Law, it was as a beautiful vine adorned with branches, which even the neighboring nations admired." This was exactly the state of Israel in the days of Joash and Jeroboam II.; but their prosperity was prostituted to purposes of idolatry. Jerome also, in any other part of his exposition, approaches this sense. Taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>, in the sense of "<span class="accented">to equal</span>," he says, "The fecundity of the grapes equaled the fecundity of the branches: but they who had previously been so fruitful before they offended God, afterwards turned the abundance of fruits into multiplied occasions of offence; and the greater the population they possessed, the more altars they built, and exceeded the abundant produce of the land by the multitude of their idols." Or the verb may mean, "it made fruit equal to itself;" nearly so the Vulgate. The fruit is agreeable to it. <span class="cmt_word">According to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars.</span> In this second or middle clause of the verse the figure passes into the fact represented by it. It is no longer the vine, but Israel. The altars kept pace with the increase of population and abundant produce; the multiplication of altars for idolatrous sacrifice and service was proportionate to their prosperity. The <span class="accented">l'</span> here and in next clause marks the circumlocutory genitive, and the <span class="accented">ke</span> is quantitative. <span class="cmt_word">According to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images</span> (margin, <span class="accented">statues</span>, or, <span class="accented">standing images</span>). The <span class="accented">matstsevoth</span> here mentioned are <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., that is, statues or pillars, and those pillars were erected to Baal or some other idol, as we read in <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The plural of the verb in this last <span class="accented">clause</span> arises from Israel being a noun of multitude. Rashi gives the following brief exposition: "<span class="accented">Just</span> in proportion as I caused their prosperity to overflow to them, they multiplied calves for the altars;" but Kimchi explains both clauses more fully and accurately thus: "<span class="accented">As</span> I increased their prosperous state in treasures and children, they multiplied altars to Baal; as I did good to their land in corn and wine and oil, they waxed strong in setting up pillars for other gods;" the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;</span> has the same sense here as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d4;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;</span> in <a href="../../par/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their heart is divided</span>. Here their wickedness is traced to its fountainhead; its source was in the corrupt state of the heart. Their heart was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> divided, and so they halted between two opinions - between the worship of Jehovah and idolatry. <span class="accented">Chalaq</span> is taken in this signification by the Chaldee, Syriac, Septuagint, and Jerome, as also by the Hebrew commentators. The LXX. have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the singular, which affords some support to Hitzig's rendering, "He (God)divided their heart," - but this is unsuitable and unscriptural; another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> reading of the same version is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "They have divided their hearts," which is somewhat better, yet incorrect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The Authorized Version is also questionable, as the verb is not used intransitively in Qal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi, indeed, understands <span class="accented">chalaq</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">niehloq</span> in the Niphal, and interprets, "From the fear of God and from his Law their heart is divided," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. separated; similarly Rashi: "Their heart is divided from me;" Aben Ezra somewhat peculiarly, though to the same purport: "They (their heart) has not one part (but several),"or is divided. But, notwithstanding this consensus in favor of the meaning of "divide," the rendering preferred, and justly so, by modern expositors in general, is "smooth." This is, indeed, the primary sense, that of "divide" being secondary, as division was made by lot or a smooth stone, <span class="accented">cheleq</span>, used for the purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Their heart is <span class="accented">smooth</span>," that is, bland, deceitful, hypocritical; though it must be admitted that the word is mostly applied to the tongue, lip, throat, mouth, speech, and not to the heart. Their heart was hypocritical and faithless. <span class="cmt_word">Now shall they be found faulty</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they shall be dealt with as such</span>, or <span class="accented">punished</span>; better still, perhaps, is the rendering, <span class="accented">now shall they atone</span>. The "<span class="accented">now"</span> defines sharply the turning-point between God's love and God's wrath. The state of things hitherto existing cannot continue; it must soon come to an end. Ere long they are doomed to discover their guilt in its punishment; they shall find out their sin by suffering; suddenly and to their cost they shall have a fearful awaking to a sense of their iniquity by the inflictions of Divine wrath upon their guilty heads. <span class="cmt_word">He shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e4;</span> is peculiar; being a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, the neck, it signifies "to break the neck of," like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, decollate, then figuratively "tear down," "break in pieces." This bold expression of breaking the neck of the altars may allude to their destruction by breaking off the horns of the altars, or rather to their beheading, cutting off the heads of victims at those altars. The Hebrew expositors make the heart of the people, not God, the immediate object of the verb. "<span class="accented">Their</span> heart," says one of them, "shall tear down their altars and lay waste their pillars, because it is divided from me. It will tear down their altars which they are said also to have multiplied, and lay waste their pillars which they made so goodly." The means of sinning shall be taken from them and destroyed - their altars broken down and their images spoiled. <span class="accented">As</span> the heads of victims had been cut off at these altars erected for idolatrous worship; so the heads of their altars would be broken off. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-3.htm">Hosea 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the Lord.</span> In the day of their destruction Israel would be brought to see and even feel that the king appointed through their own self-will and fancied plenitude of power was unable to protect or help them, and that because they had rejected Jehovah and cast aside his fear. The point of time denoted by "now" is either when they see destruction before their eyes, or when Israel is already in captivity. Rashi explains it in the former sense: "When destruction shall come upon them, they shall say, 'We have no king,' that is, our king on whom we set our hopes when we said, 'Our king shall go out before us and light our battles,' affords us no help whatever." Kimchi explains similarly, but fixes the "now" in the time of the Captivity: "Now, when they shall be carried out of their land, they shall recognize and say, 'We have no king;' the explanation is, as it' we had no king among us, for there is no strength in him to deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, as we thought when we asked for a king who should march at our head and fight our battles. God - blessed be he! - was our King, and we needed no king, and he it was that delivered us out of the hand of our enemies when we did his will." Aben Ezra and others understand it as the expression of a wild licorice on the part of Israel, recklessly giving vent to an anarchical and atheistic spirit: "As soon as their heart was divided they had no wish to have a king over them, and had no fear of Jehovah; therefore they had no fear, and every one did what was right in his own eyes." This exposition neglects the note of time, as also the causal particle that follows. They bethought themselves that, as they had not feared Jehovah, but neglected his Law, the king which they had demanded could do them no good. "What," they asked, "can the king do for us? He has no power to deliver us, since God is angry with us, for we have sinned against him?" Such is the confession of Israel in captivity. Pusey remarks in reference to this: "In sin, all Israel had asked for a king, when the Lord was their King; in sin, Ephraim had made Jeroboam king; in sin, their subsequent kings were made, without the counsel and advice of God; and now, as the close of all, they reflect how fruitless it all was." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God, by the prophet, had charged Israel with fruitlessness</span>, or with bringing forth fruit to themselves; with perverting the bounties of his providence in promoting idolatry; with their division of heart, or deceitfulness of heart. He had also threatened to punish them for their sin, and to deprive them of the means of sinning by destroying the instruments thereof, and to prevent their obtaining any help from their king, proving to them the folly of depending on him. He now proceeds, in this and following verses (4-8), to point out their moral corruption, the usual consequence or concomitant of irreligion and of false religion, instancing their deceptive dealing in the common affairs of life and their perjury in public compacts or covenants, as also their general unrighteousness. He threatens to destroy their idols to the distress of their worshippers and ministering priests as well as of their chief city. He threatens further to cause their calf-idols to be carried into captivity, pouring shame and contempt on their enterprises; to cut off their king; to leave the places of their idol-worship desolate, filling the people with distress and despair because of all their sins. <span class="cmt_word">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant.</span> In this fourth verse the prophet deplores the absence of truth, faithfulness, and loyalty to duty. This expression, "they have spoken words," is generally understood to signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "empty words," "false words," only words and no more, like the Latin <span class="accented">verba alicui dare</span>. Thus their vain, deceitful, lying words in private transactions and common affairs of everyday life would correspond to their perjury in public treaties and covenants. Their words were deceitful and their oaths falsehood. In their ordinary business transactions they used words, empty words, words without truth, corresponding thereto; in international concerns they had pursued the same course of falsifying and covenant-breaking. After entering into an engagement with the Assyrian king Shalmaneser, they made a covenant with So King of Egypt, as we read in <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>, "<span class="accented">And</span> the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So King of Egypt, and brought no present to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year." In this latter case they acted as covenant-breakers, and at the same time contravened the Divine command, which forbade them entering into covenants with foreigners. The first clause, however, is understood by some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in the sense of "deliberating.' Thus Kimchi understands it, erroneously referring it to Jeroboam and his countrymen; thus: "<span class="accented">Jeroboam</span> and his companions took counsel what they should do in order to strengthen the government in his hand, and they deliberated (or held consultation) that the people should not go up to Jerusalem to the house of the sanctuary; and for this purpose they bound themselves by oath and made a covenant. But their oath was a vain one, because their oath was intended to frustrate the words of the Law and the command of God, and to make images for their worship." The words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d5;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span> have been explained by some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">as</span> "<span class="accented">oaths</span> of vanity," that is, oaths by vanity or an idol, as an oath of Jehovah is an oath by Jehovah, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> being taken for a noun in the plural; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as predicate, while the following words supply the subject; thus: "their covenant contracts are oaths of vanity." This mistake of taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> for a noun arose from the anomalous form of the word, which is really a verb. The form is explained by Aben Ezra, who calls it an irregular formation, as if it were compounded of the infinitive construct as indicated by the ending <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and the infinitive absolute as indicated by the <span class="accented">qamets</span> in the first syllable; it is in reality the infinitive absolute, and the irregularity is owing to the assonance with <span class="accented">karoth</span> thence resulting. As to the <span class="accented">construction</span>, it is that of the infinitive standing in place of the finite verb, of which Gesenius says, "This is frequent... in the expression of several successive acts or states, where only the first of the verbs employed takes the required form in respect to tense and person, the others being simply put in the infinitive with the same tense and person implied." The meaning of the clause is obviously that there was no longer any respect for the sanctity of an oath; while the treaties refer to those made with the Assyrian king, with the object of securing and upholding the government. <span class="cmt_word">Thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span> The judgment here spoken of is understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the Hebrew interpreters, following the Chaldee Version, as the judgment of God and consequent punishment of Israel because of sin; thus Kinchi: "<span class="accented">Therefore</span> there springs up against them the judgment of chastisements and punishments like hemlock, which is a bitter herb that springs up on the furrows of the field." Some, again, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> explain it of the decree of the kings of Israel in reference to the worship of idols, which, like a bitter herb, was to issue in national ruin. We much prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the more obvious sense of the clause which refers it to the perversion of judgment and justice. Thus Amos addresses them as those who "turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteous<span class="accented">ness</span> in the earth," and calls on them to "<span class="accented">establish</span> judgment in the gate;" and Habakkuk writes, "<span class="accented">Wrong</span> [wrested] judgment proceedeth." It is implied in the mention of <span class="accented">furrows</span> that there has been careful preparation for the intended crop. The seed they sow is injustice; and the plant that springs up from it is a poison-plant - hemlock, bitter and noxious, and is everywhere rampant. Another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> explanation understands "judgment" in the sense of crime which calls on judgment for punishment. The field is that of the Israelitish nation; in all the furrows of that wide field judgment, that is, crime, springs up as luxuriantly and abundantly as hemlock. The multiplication of crime in Israel, like a luxurious noxious growth in some large field, is the idea thus conveyed. This explanation has the appearance at least of being somewhat strained and forced, though it yields a good sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof <i>that</i> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear Because of the calves of Beth-aven.</span> Samaria was the capital of Israel, the northern kingdom. Bethel means "house of God," once a place of sacred memory from its association with the history of the patriarch Jacob; afterward one of the two centers of idolatrous worship, and here called Beth-aven, "house of vanity," because of the idolatry. The word for "calves" is in the feminine, in order to express contempt for those idols which Jeroboam set up. With this have been compared the following expressions in Greek and Latin: <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, and O <span class="accented">vere Phrygiae, nec enim Phryges!</span> The Hebrews ignored the existence of female divinities, as of their, ten names of the Deity all are masculine. The feminine may also imply their weakness; so far from helping their worshippers, their worshippers were in trepidation for them, or rather it, lest it should be carried away captive. Further, this same word is in the plural, to cast ridicule on it, as if mimicking the plural of majesty, or rather, perhaps, to include that of Dan, or to intimate that the calf of Bethel, the more celebrated place, was that after which the calf of Dan and probably those of other places were fashioned, especially so as it is afterwards referred to in the singular. Besides, a few  - a very few - manuscripts, it is true, read the singular, as also the LXX., which has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Syriac; while Bathe, relying on these authorities, maintains the reading to have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> in the singular. Others suppose an enallage of both gender and number; or an indefinite generality is expressed by the plural, while for abstracts the feminine is used. The coming punishment is casting its shadow before, so that the inhabitants, perceiving symptoms of its approach, tremble for their god of gold, now, like themselves, in greatest jeopardy<span class="cmt_word">. For the people thereof shall mourn over it.</span> The people of Israel are now called the people of the calf, as once they had been the people of Jehovah, and as Moab was called the people of Chemosh. They had chosen the calf for their god. Of their own free-will they had done so, though at first enjoined and prompted to adopt this course by the mandate of their king; they had even rejoiced and gloried in it. Now they mourn for their idol, which can neither help itself nor them. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</span> According to this rendering, the relative must be understood before "rejoiced," which, though quite possible and not ungrammatical, is, however, unnecessary. The Hebrew commentators all understand the word in the sense of "joy" or "jubilation;" thus Rashi says," Why is it that its people mourn over, it and its priests, who always rejoiced over it, now mourn over its glory that is gone away?" The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, however, is primarily "to twist or whirl one's self," and is thence applied to any violent emotion, generally of joy, also of anxiety and fear, as here, so that the simpler and more correct rendering is, <span class="accented">the priests thereof shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it</span>. The priests here mentioned have a peculiar name, <span class="accented">kemarim</span>, from <span class="accented">kamar, to</span> be black, from the black garments in which they ministered, and are thus distinguished as ministers of a foreign cult; for kohen is the usual word for a Hebrew priest, and his robe of office is said to have been white. The glory of the calf-god was not the temple treasure at Bethel, nor its glory as the state God set up there, but the honor and the Divine halo with which its worship there was surrounded. Thus Kimchi: "When its glory is departed from it; and this means the honor of its worship. When the calf is broken before their eyes its glory shall depart from it." The perfects of "mourn" and "departed" are prophetic, denoting the certainty of the events, though yet future; while <span class="accented">galah</span> and <span class="accented">yagilu</span> form the favorite assonance. But a question still remains - Why is Samaria and not Beth-avert said to mourn? To this the explanation of Kimchi is a satisfactory reply: "The inhabitants of Samaria tremble. And the prophet makes mention of Samaria, though there were no calves there, because it was the metropolis of the kingdom, where the kings of Israel resided, and it was these kings who strengthened the people in the worship of the calves. And he says," When Bethel is laid waste, and the calves cannot deliver it, the inhabitants of Samaria tremble for themselves, which place (Samaria) the King of Assyria laid siege to for three years." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">It shall be also carried unto Assyria <i>for</i> a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall he also carried unto Assyria for a present to King Jareb</span>. Here we have an explanation and confirmation of what has just been said in the preceding verse. The calf, the glorious and magnificent national god, as Israel considered it, is brought to Assyria, and there offered as a present to the Assyrian king. The word <span class="accented">gam</span> is emphatic; that is, "it also," "itself also," or "it also with men and other spoils"  - the golden idol of Beth-aven. Kimchi's explanation of <span class="accented">gam</span> is as follows: "Genesis, extension or generalization of the term, refers to the glory he bad mentioned. He says, 'Lo, in its place the glory shall depart from it as soon as they shall break it. <span class="accented">Also</span>, the stump of the calf, namely, the gold thereon, after its form is broken, they shall take away as a present to King Jareb.'" The sign of the accusative with suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>, which here stands before a passive verb, may be taken either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> absolutely, "<span class="accented">as</span> to it also," "<span class="accented">it</span> shall be brought ;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as an instance of anacoluthon; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>, according to Gesenius, the passive may be regarded as an impersonal active, and thus it may take the object of the action in the accusative. The word <span class="accented">yubhal</span> is from <span class="accented">yabhal</span>, primarily used of flowing in a strong and violent stream, and so the root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, the flood; then it signifies "to go," "to be brought or carried." The <span class="accented">minchah</span> here spoken of cannot well mean tribute, but is rather a gift of homage to the Assyrian conqueror, whom the prophet m vision sees already wasting the land of Israel and carrying away all its treasures and precious things. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> The feminine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> - of which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>, the masculine, by analogy, is not in use - is wrongly explained by the Hebrew expositors as having a pleonastic <span class="accented">nun</span>. The construction usually preferred is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that given above. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others render it, "Shame shall seize Ephraim;" but tiffs constructs a feminine noun with a masculine verb, contrary to grammar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hitzig translates," He (the Assyrian king) shall take away or carry off the shame of Ephraim; that <span class="accented">is</span>, the calf-idol." He remarks that the construct feminine does not always in the speech of North Israel end in <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5ea;</span>, and cites several passages in proof. The <span class="accented">counsel</span> of which Israel would be ashamed is understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the consultation held before making a covenant or treaty with the King of Assyria; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is generally and more correctly understood of Jeroboam taking counsel with his tribesmen of Ephraim about setting up the calf idols. Jareb is a proper name, or rather an appellation. The King of Assyria, or the great king, was looked up to by the smaller Asiatic states for protection, and consequently styled their <span class="accented">Jareb</span>, avenger or defender, just as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;</span>. savior, was a title applied to or assumed by certain kings for a similar reason, as Ptolemy Soter and others. The object of Israel's idolatry is carried off as a present to propitiate or appease the wrath of the Assyrian patron and protector - probably Shalmaneser in the present instance - or taken as a trophy to grace the triumph of the conqueror. So far from defending the calf-people, as Israel had become, their calf-god could not defend itself; instead of preserving its worshippers from deportation, it was doomed itself to deportation. Ephraim, the premier tribe. received shame, and Israel, the remaining tribes that had followed its lead and adopted its evil counsel, shared the shame; all of them together were thoroughly put to shame because of their mistaken and wicked policy. The counsel of Jeroboam - for to it, in our opinion, is the reference - appeared an able stroke of policy; but this policy, by which he hoped to detach Israel from Judah, was not only frustrated, but proved positively ruinous, so far were the means from effecting the end, or the end from justifying the wisdom of the means. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As for</i> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for Samaria, her king is out off as the foam upon the water</span> (face <span class="accented">of the</span> waters). Instead of the throne of Samaria being established, or the kingdom consolidated by the idolatrous measures which Jeroboam had adopted for the purpose, the king himself was cut off as foam upon the surface of the waters, or as a chip carried off by the current, and the kingdom ingloriously ruined. Though the sense is sufficiently plain, the sentence has been variously constructed. Thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> one of the Hebrew commentators renders it, "In the city of Samaria her king has been made like foam on the surface of the water" (be being understood and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> taken in the sense of "being like"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Rashi, understanding the verb to signify being "reduced to silence," explains, "The King of Samaria is brought to silence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The correct signification of the verb, however, is "cut off" or "annihilated," while the construction may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> an asyndeton; thus: "Samaria (and) her king;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Samaria taken as nominative absolute,  - thus in the Authorized Version, "(As for) Samaria, her king is cut off;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> supplying <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> to the second noun, with Aben Ezra, "Samaria is cut off, her king is cut off." Some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> consider it simpler to translate as follows: "Samaria is cut off; her king is like [literally, 'as'] a chip on the surface of the waters." In this way the Massoretic punctuation is neglected. <span class="accented">Sheraton is</span> feminine, as the names of cities and countries usually are, and therefore the suffix to "king" is feminine, while the masculine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, is justified by its position at the head of the sentence; for, according to Gesenius, the predicate at the beginning of a clause or sentence "often takes its simplest and readiest form, viz. the masculine singular, even when the subject," not yet expressed, but coming after, "is feminine or plural." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span> is explained either as "foam" or "splinter." The latter is, perhaps, preferable, as the verbal root cognate with the Arabic <span class="accented">katsapha</span> signifies "to break," "break off," "crack;" then "to be angry" (its most common meaning) from the sudden breaking out or breaking loose of passion, with which may be compared the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="../../par/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>, from the same root, is literally a" breaking or breaking off," "barking," The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span>, again, has two principal meanings - one "to be like," the other "to be silent" (connected, according to Gesenius, with a different root, <span class="accented">darnam, dum, like</span> the English "dumb"); or the meanings are traceable to one root, in the sense of "making flat," "plane," "smooth;" then "silent," and so "reduced to silence," "destroyed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high places also of Avon, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed.</span> By Aven is generally understood <span class="accented">Beth-aven</span>, that is, Bethel; but some take the word as an appellative, and thus <span class="accented">bamoth-aven</span> would signify the "high places of iniquity." These unlawful places of sacrifice and unholy places of iniquity are further characterized by the appositional "the sin of Israel." By constructing and frequenting such places Israel had primarily and grievously sinned. By sacrificing to and worshipping even Jehovah on these high places instead of in Jerusalem, the only legal place for Divine service under the Law, their national sin in the matter of worship began; subsequently, <span class="accented">however</span>, things became worse, and these high places became scenes of most abominable idolatries and shamelessly sinful practices. Those places - one and all - are in the words before us doomed to destruction. <span class="cmt_word">The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars.</span> The destruction is thus vividly described as total and complete; those bad eminences were devoted to entire wasteness and desolation. "It is a sign of extreme solitude," says Jerome, "so that no traces even of wall or buildings remained to be seen;" similarly Rashi says, "Thorns and thistles shall grow up upon their altars, because the worshippers thereof have departed and no one longer remains to attend to them" so Kimchi: "On the altars of Israel which they (the enemies) shall lay waste shall thorns spring up." <span class="cmt_word">And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span> The sight of such fearful ruin and desolation overwhelms the wretched inhabitants of the land with distress and dismay; in sheer despair and even desperation they invoke a sure and sudden death as much preferable to their remaining longer spectators of such heart-rending scenes. Their exclamation appears to be proverbial, and to have had its origin in the custom of the Israelites fleeing, in seasons of great calamities, to the mountains and clefts of the rocks to hide themselves; thus in <a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a> we read that "because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and eaves, and strongholds." The object of their exclamation is to be buried under the hills or mountains rather than endure such calamities longer; or rather than the enemies should see them in their shame. Aben Ezra makes "altars" the subject of "shall say," as if it were the wish of the altars to be covered that they may never more be seen. Theodoret considers the sense of the passage to be that the multitude of calamities in the war occasioned by hostile invasion would be so great that there would be no one who would not prefer being overwhelmed in an earthquake or by the sudden fall of the mountains, rather than endure the calamities inflicted by the enemies. Similarly, but more concisely, Jerome says, "They are more willing to die than see the evils that bring death." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-9.htm">Hosea 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah.</span> Two explanations given of this clause - namely, that which understands, <span class="accented">rain</span> comparatively, that is, "more than" - their sins were greater than those of the Benjamites in the days of Gibeah; and that which refers the sin here spoken of to the appointment of Saul, who was of Gibeah of Benjamin, to be king - must be unhesitatingly rejected. Tile sin of the men of Gibeah was the shameful outrage committed on the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah, which with its consequences is recorded in <a href="../../par/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. and 20. That sin became proverbial, overtopping, as it did, all ordinary iniquities by its shameless atrocity and heinousness. By along-continued course of sin, even from ancient days, Ephraim has been preparing for a fearful doom. <span class="cmt_word">There they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</span> This portion of the verse is not a little perplexing, and in consequence has called forth considerable diversity of exposition. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which is implied in the Authorized Version, viz. "there they <span class="accented">stood</span>," smitten twice but not destroyed, chastened but not killed, the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them then so as utterly to destroy them, but it shall overtake them now. Or if the verb "overtake," which is future, be strictly rendered, the meaning is - Not a battle like that in Gibeah against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but one much more sanguinary and terrible, resulting, not in the reduction of a single tribe to six hundred men, but in the extirpation of ten tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of Keil and others, though not the same, is similar. It is: "There, in Gibea, did they <span class="accented">remain</span>, persevering in the sin of Gibeah, and yet the war in Gibeah against the sinners has not overtaken them." This makes the meaning of the prophet to be that since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persevered in the same or like sin as the Gibeahites; and, though the Gibeahites were so severely punished, actually destroyed, because of their sin, the ten tribes of Israel, persisting in the same or similar sin, have not yet been resisted with any such exterminating war. Jehovah announces his intention now to visit them with punishment and severest chastisement for all. The meaning which Keil aims at may be better brought out by rendering the latter clause interrogatively; thus: "There they stood - persisting in the criminality of Gibeah - shall there not overtake them, living as they do in Gibeah, the war which exterminated the children of crime?" It is admitted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> may have been the meaning of "persevering;" but a better sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is gained by Wunsche referring the subject of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> to the Benjamites; the suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> to the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, or "children of iniquity," that is, their guilty tribesmen in Gibeah; taking the intermediate clause parenthetically; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> to "stand in defense of;" thus: "Since the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there they (the Benjamites) stood in defense of the children of iniquity, that the war might not reach them in Gibeah." This gives a satisfactory sense, and intimates that, by a long-continued course of iniquity and crime, the Ephraimites were preparing themselves for a fearful fate. Already from days long gone by grievous guilt cleaved to them; thus in the days of Gibeah they (the Benjamites) stood by their iniquitous brethren that the battle in Gibeah might not reach them. As this was before the disruption, the Benjamites were part and parcel of Israel here represented by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller's explanation is the following: "They (the Benjamites) <span class="accented">survived</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>) being severely punished, though they did not entirely perish, six hundred being left to revive the tribe." But a still severer punishment awaits the Israelites (the person being changed from the second to the third, and the prophet addressing himself to hearer or reader): not the war waged in Gibeah (or on account of the crime committed there) against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but a far more deadly and destructive war. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> is by metathesis for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, commotion; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>.

Thus Kimchi says, "The prophet compares Judah and Ephraim to two plowing oxen. I thought they would plough well, but they have ploughed ill, since they have bound themselves together one with the other and have allied themselves the one with the other to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah." Similarly Rosenm&uuml;ller: "To be bound to two furrows is said of oxen plowing when they are bound together in a common yoke, so that in two adjacent furrows they walk together and with equal pace." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint rendering, based on the Qeri and followed by the Syriac and Arabic, gives a better and clearer sense than the preceding. It is, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and is followed by Jerome in <span class="accented">Super duas iniquitates suas</span>, as also by the most judicious expositors of ancient and modern times. Yet there is great variety as to what those iniquities are. Some, like Jerome, refer to the double idolatry - that of Micah and that of Jeroboam; others, like Dathe, to the two golden calves set up at Dan and Bethel; Cyril and Theodoret to the apostasy of Israel from Jehovah, and devotion to idols; De Wette and Keil to the double unfaithfulness of Israel to Jehovah and the royal house of David. The exact rendering would, according to any of these views, be, "When I bind them to their two transgressions," or, "When I allow the foreigners to bind them on account of their two transgressions;" that is to connect or yoke them to their two transgressions by the punishment, so that they, like beasts of burden, must drag them after them, whatever be the view we take of the nature of those transgressions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Ephraim <i>is as</i> an heifer <i>that is</i> taught, <i>and</i> loveth to tread out <i>the corn</i>; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, <i>and</i> Jacob shall break his clods.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn.</span> Ephraim is compared to a heifer trained. The work she was taught to do was treading cut the corn; by training and habit it had became a second nature, so that she took delight in it. The connecting vowel occurs seldom, and usually with an antique coloring in prose, according to Ewald; it is poetical besides, and used in the concourse of words somewhat closely connected, but not in the strict construct state. Thus is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> accounted for. This work was probably easier, at all events pleasanter, than plowing or harrowing. In treading out corn oxen were not yoked together, but worked singly, treading it with their feet, or drawing a threshing-sledge, or iron-armed cylinder, over it; they were unmuzzled also, so that they were free to snatch an occasional mouthful of the grain, and frequently fattened by such indulgence. Such had been the position of Ephraim in easy employment, comfortable circumstances like the heifer threshing and allowed to eat at pleasure, pleasantly situated prosperous, self-indulgent, and luxurious. The victories of Ephraim - threshing and treading down may perhaps be also hinted at. <span class="cmt_word">But I passed over upon her fair neck</span> (margin, <span class="accented">the beauty of her neck</span>): <span class="cmt_word">I will make Ephraim to ride; Judak shall plough, and Jacob shall break his clods.</span> Times have changed, as is here indicated a yoke, that of Assyria, is placed on the fair neck, a rider is set on the sleek back. Mere onerous and less pleasant labor is now imposed. Judah too is to share the toil, being put to the heavier work of plowing while Jacob - the ten tribes, or the twelve including both Judah and Israel - shall cross plough; and thus both alike shall be henceforth employed in the heaviest labors of the field and the severest toils of agriculture. Once victorious, Ephraim is now to be subdued; once free and intractable, it must now receive the yoke and engage in laborious service. The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, is generally used in a bad sense; "to <span class="accented">pass over</span>," says Jerome, "especially when it is said of God, always signifies inflictions and troubles." The fatness of the neck is the ox's ornament or beauty. That is now to be assaulted or invaded gently it may be, and softly, as men are wont to approach a young untamed animal in order to put the yoke upon it. This passing over, however tender, fixes the yoke on Ephraim's neck all the same. A more difficult word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, which Ewald <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> renders, "I will set a rider" on Ephraim, of course to subdue and tame; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome has, "I will mount or ride," thus representing Jehovah himself as the mediate rider on Ephraim. The first sense has a parallel in <a href="../../par/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>, "Thou hast made men to ride over our head," and thus ruling them at pleasure. Unwilling to bear the easy yoke of their Divine Ruler, they shall be subjected to the tyrant mastery of man. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil says the word here is "not" to mount or ride, 'but' to drive or use for drawing and driving,' <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> harness," as to the plough and harrow. This meaning is best reached by understanding the words thus: "I will make the yoke to ride on Ephraim's neck;" as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5db;&#x5d1;</span> is used in <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-16.htm">2 Kings 13:16</a>, for "put thine hand upon the bow," margin, "make thine hand to ride upon the bow." The remaining clauses of the verse is a further development of this expression, but extending to Judah; and thus including both Judah and Ephraim, or Jacob - both kingdoms. The Septuagint version of the last clause is peculiar; it is <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;</span>. That is, as explained by Jerome, "I shall leave Judah for the present and say nothing about him; but whoever, whether of Ephraim or Judah, shall observe my precepts, he shall acquire strength for himself and be called Jacob." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for <i>it is</i> time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy.</span> These two verses contain a call to repentance and reformation of life, in figurative language borrowed from the same department of human industry, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e6;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> is "for righteousness;" that is, sow such seed as that righteousness may spring from it. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span> is "according to," or "in proportion to, mercy."

Kimchi explains it correctly, thus: "Sow to yourselves, etc., that is, do good in mine eyes, and the recompense from me shall be far greater than your good deeds, just as if one sows a measure (seah), and hopes to reap therefore two measures (seahs) or still more. Therefore, he uses in sowing righteousness, and in connection with reaping grace, in order to intimate that grace surpasses righteousness. Or that God rewards men's actions, not according to merit, but according to grace. As men sew, they reap; accordingly Israel is directed to sow ac-eroding to righteousness - to act righteously in their dealings with their fellow-men; and their reaping or reward would be, not in proportion to what they had sown, not merely commensurate with their righteous actions or dealings, not proportionate to what justice would give; but in proportion to mercy - Divine mercy, and so far above their highest deserts. They are promised a reward far above their poor doings, and irrespective of their sad failings - a reward, not of debt, not of merit, but of grace. The seed-time of righteousness would be followed by a reaping-time proportionate to the boundless measure of the Divine mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</span> Here they are urged to turn over a new leaf, as we say; to begin a new life; to root out the weeds of sin; to eradicate those evil passions that checked and stifled any noble feelings, as the husbandman runs his plough through the fallow field, and breaks it up, clearing out the weeds and roots, that the ground may be pure and clean for the sowing of the seed in spring. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;</span> translates accordingly by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. They are further reminded that it is high time to begin this process, laying aside their stiff-necked, perverse ways; expelling from their heart the noxious growth that had overspread it; and by every way and means working earnestly and zealously for a renewal of life and return to the long-neglected work and worship of Jehovah. Neither were they to relax their efforts till the blessed end was attained, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span>, with imperfect, marking the goal to be reached; nor would their efforts be in vain. The Lord would rain - bestow abundantly upon them, or touch (another and more frequent meaning of the word), their righteousness. Thus the ground that had long lain fallow must be broken up; its waste, wild state must cease and give place to cultivation; the ploughshare must be driven through it; its wild growths and weeds must be cut down and uprooted. A process of renewal must succeed; the vices of their natural state, the idolatrous and wicked practices that had sprung up, must be abandoned. Renewal and radical reform are imperatively demanded. Matters had remained too long in a miserable and unsatisfactory condition. A long night of sinful slumber had overcome them; it was high time to awake out of that sleep. Too long had they shamefully forgotten and forsaken God; it was more than time to wait upon him. Nor would such waiting, if persevered in, end in disappointment; notwithstanding their great and manifold provocations, he would come and rain righteousness in welcome, refreshing, and plenteous showers upon returning penitents; and with righteousness would be conjoined its reward of blessing and salvation, both temporal and spiritual. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have ploughed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies.</span> Hitherto their course had been the very opposite of that which they are now exhorted to enter on. Hitherto their work had been wickedness, and their wages, as might be expected, the fruit of iniquity. What they had wrought for they reaped. Their plowing had been sin, their sowing wickedness, and their harvest sorrow. Wickedness against God and man was what they both ploughed and sowed; oppression at the hand of their enemies was the harvest or reward of iniquity which they reaped. Their lies, including their idolatry in reference to God, disloyalty to their king, their false words and false works with one another, bore fruit, bitter fruit, sour fruit, and they were obliged to eat that fruit till their teeth were set on edge. Thus Kimchi explains it: "After the plowing follows the sowing, and both of them are a figurative representation of work, as we have explained it. The prophet says, 'Ye have done the opposite of that which I commanded you, when I said, Sow to yourselves in righteousness.'" The harvest is the reward of the work done; the genitive is expressive of contents - that in which the fruit consists; the fruit of lies against God is the fruit which disappoints those who wait for it <span class="accented">Ki</span> directs attention to the ground of Israel's gradual declension and final destruction; the two fundamental errors, or rather evils, that led on to Israel's ruin, were apostasy from Jehovah and sinful self-confidence. Sunk in idolatry, they no longer looked to Jehovah as the Source of their power and strength; while they pursued their own ways, confident of the excellence of their own sagacity and foresight. <span class="cmt_word">Because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</span> They had placed their confidence in the wisdom of their own ways - their prudent plans and wise counsels; in the heroism of their soldiers and the excellence of their preparations of war. By these means they fancied themselves independent of the Almighty, and sufficiently defended against their enemies. "Thou hast trusted," says Kimchi, in his exposition, "to thine own way which thou goest; and that is the way of iniquity and of confidence in evil; and in like manner thou hast trusted in the multitude of thy men of war which thou hast had among thine own people, or among the Egyptians, from whom they sought help, and thou hast made flesh thine arm, and not trusted in me; therefore thou hast stumbled."

The tumult of war is already heard, and the work of destruction has begun. The word <span class="accented">shaon</span>, tumult, is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as applied to the loud rushing of waters, then the tumult of advancing warriors. The preposition <span class="accented">be</span> is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as above by the Authorized Version, Umbreit, and others; and, joined with "peoples" (which is plural), signifies that the confused noise of war would be heard among their own peoples, or the multitude of the mighty ones in whom they had had such confidence; or the plural may refer to the tribes of Israel, each of which was an <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>, though Keil would confine this meaning to Pentateuchal times. Host of the versions read the singular, like our own Authorized Version, yet it must still be referred to the people of Israel. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the preposition is translated "against" by many modern interpreters, and thus the confused noise of the advance of the enemy against Israel is denoted. The attack of the invaders is directed against the <span class="accented">fortresses</span>, or fenced cities, so called from a verb denoting "to cut off" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e6;&#x5d3;</span>), as if all approach to them were cut off, and assault impossible. Nevertheless they were to go down, all of them, before the enemy - laid waste and spoiled; while inhuman cruelty would characterize the conquerors. As an illustration of or specimen resembling that cruelty, an obscure piece of history is quoted. <span class="cmt_word">As Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children</span>. In the great variety of opinion with respect to the event referred to, and the consequent diversity of exposition, we shall not venture to do more than select that which on the whole, notwithstanding a certain chronological difficulty that lies against it, appears the most probable. Accordingly, Beth-arbel may have been Arbela, mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:2 and more than once by Josephus, in Upper Galilee, in the tribe of Naphtali, between Sephoris and Tiberias, now <span class="accented">Irbid</span>; and <span class="accented">Shalman</span> may be an abbreviation for Shal-maneser; while the circumstance here mentioned may have been an incident of the campaign of which we read in <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3, 5</a>. "Against him came up Shalmaneser King of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant.... Then the King of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years." The manifestation of the cruelty was when the mother, with true motherly affection, bent over her children to defend them, and she and they perished in a common ruin, or when the children were dashed to the ground before their mother's eyes, and she, done to death, hurled upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a></div><div class="verse">So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness</span> (margin, <span class="accented">the evil of your evil</span>): <span class="cmt_word">in a morning shall the King of Israel utterly be cut off</span>. Their coming sufferings were all traceable to their sin. Bethel, the principal place of calf-worship, was the cause of their coming calamities, not the place itself, but the wickedness of which it was the scene. The real cause was the great and crowning wickedness practiced there. Bethel, once the house of God, would in consequence become another Beth-arbel, the house of the ambush of God. In the morning, when perhaps a season of prosperity seemed beginning to dawn, or at an early dale and in a speedy manner, quickly as the morning dawn gives place before the rising sun, the king, Hoshea, or perhaps no particular king, but merely the representative of the royal office, would be cut off-entirely cut off. Thus their main refuge would come to an ignominious end, bringing along with it the frustration of all their hopes and the conclusion of their mistaken and misplaced confidences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hosea/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hosea 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> after time-determinations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The life of a nation has its stages of rise, progress, and development, like the life of an individual man. The prophet goes back to that early period when the national life of Israel was in its infancy; it was then that a few patriarchs who had gone down to sojourn in Egypt were becoming a people; the predicate precedes, to emphasize, that early day when Israel became God's peculiar people. The <span class="accented">ray</span> marks the apodosis recording God's love in choosing that people, calling them into the relation of sonship, and delivering them out of Egypt. <span class="accented">Thus</span> Kimchi says, "When Israel was vet a child, <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> Egypt, then I loved him, therefore I am more angry with them than with the rest of the nations; for from their youth onward I have loved them, and delivered them out of the bands of their enemies. But when they transgress my commandments it is incumbent on me to chastise them as a man chastises his son." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The people of Israel is called God's son in consequence of God choosing them and bringing them into close relationship to himself, such as that of a son to a father. The commencement was the message to Pharaoh by Moses in the words, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn: and I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me." This sonship was solemnly ratified by the giving of the Law at Sinai; and the condition clearly stated that, in the event of their preserving the knowledge of God, fulfilling his Law, and doing his will, they would at all times enjoy Divine protection, defense, and blessing, while from generation to generation they were addressed by that honorable title. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As the deliverance hem Egypt is always described as a "leading" or "bringing out," and never elsewhere as a "calling out," some expositors maintain that the words, "out of Egypt," signify from the time Israel was in Egypt, and are parallel to "when Israel was a child," both referring to time, the time of national infancy. From that period God began to manifest his love, and in its manifestation he called him by the endearing name of "son" - my son. The words of this verse are applied by St. Matthew to the sojourn of  Jesus in Egypt. The older interpreters refer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the first part of the verse to Israel and the second part typically to the history of Messiah's childhood, in whom that of Israel reached its completeness. Rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the verse was applied typically to Israel, and to Jesus as the antitype; to the former primarily, and to the latter secondarily. Thus the head and the members are comprehended in one common prediction.

The correct reference is that first stated, and the sense is that, instead of appreciating the invitations and monitions of the prophets of God, they showed their utter insensibility and thanklessness, turning away from them in contempt and scorn. Nay, the more the messengers of God called them, the more they turned a deaf ear to those who were their truest friends and best advisers. Pursuing their idolatrous practices, they sacrificed to Baal, that is to say, the various representations of that idol, and burned incense to their images, whether of wood or stone or precious metal. Thus Kimchi correctly comments as follows: "The prophets which I sent to them called to them morning and evening to turn to Jehovah, so (much the more) did they go away from them, not hearkening to their words nor desisting from their evil works." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, even so, denoting the measure or relation, corresponds to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span> to be supplied in the first clause.

It is that of an affectionate parent or tender nurse teaching a child to walk by leading-strings; taking it up in the arms when stumbling or making a false step; and in case it fell curing the wound. Thus, nurse-like, God taught Ephraim, his wayward perverse child, to use his feet (so the original word imports), all the while lending considerate help and seasonable aid. He took them by the hand to guide them, that they might not stray; he took them in his arms to hold them up, that they might not stumble and to help them over any obstacle that might lie in the way; and when, left to themselves during a short season, and in order to test their strength, they did stumble and fall, he healed their hurt. And yet they did not apprehend nor appreciate God's gracious design and dealings with them in thus guiding and guarding them, and in healing their diseases both temporal and spiritual. There is, perhaps, an allusion to <a href="../../par/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee." This promise, it will be remembered, was vouchsafed immediately after the bitter waters of Marah had been sweetened by the tree which, according to Divine direction, had been cast therein. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">And</span> they have not acknowledged that I healed them of every sickness and every affliction, as he said, 'I will put none of these diseases upon thee.'" The reference is rather to all those evidences of his love which God manifested to them during their forty years' wandering in the wilderness; or perhaps to his guidance of them by 'his Law throughout their entire history. Rashi remarks that "they knew it very well, but dissembled [literally, 'trod it down with the heel,' equivalent to 'despised'] and acted, as if they did not know." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is properly taken both by Kimchi and Gesenius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>; the former says; "The <span class="accented">tar</span> stands in place of <span class="accented">he:</span> this is the opinion of the grammarians;" the latter regards it as a solitary example of Tiphel; others again consider it a corrupt reading instead of the ordinary form of Hiph. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some take it for a noun, as J. Kimchi, who says it is "a noun after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>, and although the word is Milel (while in <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> it is Milra), yet it is the same form;" thus the translation is, "As for me, my guidance was to Ephraim;" so Jerome, "I have been as a nurse to Ephraim;" likewise also Cyril. The former explanation is simpler and also otherwise preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint has the incorrect rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I bound the feet of Ephraim," which Jerome explains, "I bound the feet of Ephraim that they might not fly further from me," though his own rendering is that given above.

Thus in the Authorized Version it is "taking them by their arms;' but the common form of the infinitive of this verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; besides, the suffixes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> are contradictory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Olshausen and Ewald read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> in the first person, the received text having, according to the latter, maintained its place only through <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>; but this is conjectural and wants manuscript authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Still worse is Abarbanel's interpretation, who understands the subject of the verb and the suffix of the noun as referring to Ephraim; thus: "He (Ephraim) took them (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the idols) on his arms." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The correct explanation, as we think, is that of Kimchi and Gesenius, who take the verb for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> by a not unusual aphaeris of the <span class="accented">lamed:</span> "He took them in his arms," the transition from the first to the third person being justified by the pictorially descriptive style of the passage. The following comment of Kimchi is worthy of attention: "The prophet only mentions Ephraim (instead of all Israel), because it was he that made the calves. He says, 'And how does Ephraim reward me for this that I bestowed on them so many benefits, and accustomed them to go on their feet, and did not burthen them with my commandments and my service?' And because he has compared Ephraim to a boy, he uses the word, 'I led them by strings.' Just as one leads a boy that he may accustom himself to go little by little without trouble, so I led them from station to station, when I brought them out of Egypt; I led them gradually without overexertion, the cloud going before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love.</span> This verse contains a further representation of Jehovah's fatherly guidance of Israel. The <span class="accented">cords of a man</span> are such as parents use in leading weak or young children. <span class="accented">Bands of lore</span> qualify more closely the preceding expression, "cords of a man," and are the opposite of those which men employ in taming or breaking wild and unmanageable animals. The explanation of Rashi is similar: "I have always led them with tender cords such as these with which a man leads his child, as if he said with loving guidance." Aben Ezra and Kimchi, in their explanations, carry out more fully the same idea. The former says, "The bands of love are not like the bands which are fastened on the neck of a plowing heifer;" the latter, "Because he compared Ephraim to a heifer, and people lead a heifer with cords, he says, 'I have led Israel by the cords of a man, and not the cords of a heifer which one drags along with resistance, but as a man draws his fellow-man without compelling him to go with resistance: even so I have led them after a gentle method;' and therefore he afterward calls them (cords of a man) bands of love." The LXX., taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the sense of" injure," "destroy," have the mistaken rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, "When men were destroyed I drew them." The other Greek versions have the correct rendering. <span class="cmt_word">And I was to them as they that take off the yoke.</span> The word <span class="accented">herim</span> does not mean "to lift up on" and so "impose a yoke," as some think, nor "to take away the yoke," but "to lift it up." The figure is that of a humane and compassionate husbandman raising upwards or pushing backwards the yoke over the cheeks or dewlaps of the ox, that it may not press too heavily upon him or hinder him while eating. The reference is, according to Kimchi, to "taking the yoke off the neck, and letting it hang on the jaw, that it may not pull but rest from labor one or more hours of the day." The fact thus figuratively expressed is, not the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, but the loving-kindness of Jehovah in lightening the fulfillment of the Law to Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. omit the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, yoke, and strangely translates the clause, "I will be to them as a man smiting (another) on the cheeks." <span class="cmt_word">And I laid meat unto them.</span> The older and many modern interpreters, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> as the first person future apoc., Hiph., from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d8;&#x5d7;</span>, translate, "And I reached them food to eat," namely, the manna in the wilderness. This would require <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, which some substitute for the present reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald, Keil, and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d8;</span> as an adverb in the sense of" gradually," "gently," translating, "And gently towards him did I give him feral," or "I gently fed him."

Continuing the several clauses of this verse, we may express the meaning of the whole as follows: "Cords of a man" denote humane methods which Jehovah employed in dealing with and drawing his people - not such cords as oxen or other animals are drawn by; while "bands of love" is a kindred expression, explaining and emphasizing the former, and signifying such leading-strings as those with which a parent lovingly guides his child. The means employed by God for the help, encouragement, and support of his people were kind as they were bountiful. His benevolent and beneficent modes of procedure are further exhibited by another figure of like origin; for just as a considerate and compassionate man, a humane husbandman, gives respite and relief to the oxen at work by loosening the yoke and lifting it up off the neck upon the cheeks; and thus affords not only temporary rest and ease, but also allows an occasional mouthful or more of food, or even abundant provender, to the animal which toils in the yoke while plowing or at other work; so Jehovah extended to Israel, notwithstanding their frequent acts of unfaithfulness, his sparing mercy and tender compassions, supplying them in abundant measure with all that they needed for the sustenance and even comforts of life. Thus their sin in turning aside to other gods, which were no gods, in quest of larger benefits and more liberal support and succor, was all the more inexcusable. The next three verses (5-7) describe the severe chastisement Israel incurred by ingratitude for, and contempt of, the Divine love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-5.htm">Hosea 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</span> These words sound like an announcement that the season of Divine grace, so long extended to that sin-laden people, had at length expired; and that on account of their stubborn and on-grateful rebellion against Jehovah they would be forced, to go into exile and become subject to the monarch of Assyria. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They had been threatened with a return to Egypt and its bondage in <a href="../../par/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>, "They shall return to Egypt;" and <a href="../../par/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, "Ephraim shall return to Egypt;" vet now God, without any change of purpose, changes his mode of procedure, not allowing them to return to Egypt, but dooming them to a worse bondage under the Assyrians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Having been tributary to Assyria from the time of Menahem, they had revolted and applied to Egypt for help; now, however, no help would be permitted to come from Egypt nor even an opportunity of applying for it allowed. The power of Assyria would be paramount; instead, therefore, of native kings and Egyptian auxiliaries, Israel would have to submit to that iron yoke. However desirous of returning to Egypt, they would have neither the power nor the privilege of doing so. And this poor privilege of a choice of masters they were refused as a just retribution, because they had not repented of their sin and returned to God. Various methods have been resorted to, to harmonize the apparent contradiction alluded to, that is, between the affirmative and negative statements about Israel's return into Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dathe, Eichhorn, and De Wette agree with the LXX. in reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, and connecting it with the preceding verse; but the other versions, as well as the manuscripts, support the received text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome and Rosenm&uuml;ller explain it of the people's desire to conclude an alliance with Egypt in order to throw off the yoke of Assyria, being frustrated by the superior power of the latter; thus the sense is that they shall not return any more to Egypt, as they had lately done by their ambassadors, to seek help from that land or its people. Then he assigns the reason why they would not again send ambassadors to Egypt for the purpose indicated, because the Assyrian alone would be their king. The objection to this is that <span class="accented">lo yashubu</span> must refer to the whole people rather than to their ambassador going to and fro between the countries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald, Maurer, and others cut the knot by taking <span class="accented">lo</span> interrogatively, as if it were <span class="accented">halo</span>, and thus equivalent to an affirmative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">Shall</span> they not return to Egypt and the Assyrian be their king?" The expected answer would be in the affirmative. Neither grammar nor context sanctions this interrogative sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> According to Hitzig, Keil, Simson, and others, we are to understand Egypt in the previous places, viz. <a href="../../par/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a> and <a href="../../par/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, as <span class="accented">received</span> of the land of bondage, where in the present passage the typical sense is inadmissible, owing to the contrast with Assyria. Into Egypt Israel should not return, lest the object of the Exodus might seem frustrated, but a worse lot lay before them - another and harder bondage awaited them; the King of Assyria would be their king and reign over them, and all because of their impenitence and refusal to return to Jehovah. The following is the explanation of Kimchi: "They should not have returned to the land of Egypt to seek help; I had already said to them, 'Ye shall henceforth return no more that way;' for if they had returned to me, they would not have needed help from Egypt. And against their will Assyria rules over them, and they serve him and send him a present year by year. And why is all this? Because they refused, etc.; as if he said (they refused) to return to me; for if they had returned to me, foreign kings (literally, 'kings of the nations') would not have ruled ever them, but they would have ruled over the nations as they had done in the days of David and Solomon, when they did my will; and so have I assured them, 'Thou shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.'" The root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span> is cognate with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5e2;</span>, to hold back, refuse; the <span class="accented">le</span> strengthens the connection of the objectival infinitive with the governing verb; the ellipsis of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;</span> is obvious.

A more accurate rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the sword shall sweep round in its cities, and destroy its bolts and</span> devour. Nay, they could not free themselves from invasion and attack. The sword of war would whirl down upon their cities and consume the branches, that is, the villages, or the city bars, or the strong warriors set for defense. Some understand the word so variously interpreted in the sense of "liars," and refer it to the prophets, priests, and politicians who spake falsehood and. acted deceitfully. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;</span> is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "the sword," as the principal weapon in ancient warfare and the symbol of war's destructive power shall <span class="accented">sweep round in</span>, circulate, or make the round of the cities of Israel; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> others," whirl down," "light on ;" thus both Rashi and Kimchi. Again, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is, as already intimated, variously rendered. The most appropriate translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> is (literally, "<span class="accented">poles</span> for carrying the ark," <a href="../../par/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13</a>) "<span class="accented">bolts</span> or bars" for securing gates, the root being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span>, to separate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Some explain it as a figure for "<span class="accented">mighty</span> men;" so Jerome and the Targum, as also Rashi: "It destroys his heroes and consumes them." this is the meaning of the word preferred by Gesenius. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Ewald understands it in the sense of "fortresses," especially on the frontier, by which a land is shut against or opened to the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi take it to mean "branches," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> villages, and are followed by the Authorized Version. "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>," <span class="accented">says</span> Kimchi, "is ' branches,' and it is a figure for villages, for he had already mentioned his cities; and villages are related to cities as branches to a tree; in like manner they are called ' daughters,' being related to a city as daughters to a mother." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The LXX. render it by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, as also the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">Because of their own counsels</span>. The cause of all their calamitous invasions, which city gates barred and bolted could not shut out, was their evil counsels in departing from the Lord, as Kimchi correctly explains: "All this comes upon them in consequence of their evil counsel, because they have forsaken my service to serve other gods." Rashi draws attention to the peculiarity of the accentuation - tasha and sellug - to separate it from the preceding word. The Septuagint here again blunders, obviously reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and translating, "And shall eat (the fruit) of their evil counsel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt <i>him</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And my people are bent to backsliding from me.</span> This first clause of the verse is very expressive, every word almost having an emphasis of its own. With all their sinfulness and shortcomings, Israel was still the people of God - my <span class="accented">people</span>; they were guilty of the sin of backsliding, and of backsliding from God, the best of benefactors and their chief good. Nor was it occasionally and after long intervals of time that they backslided; it was their habit, their tendency. They were suspended on, or rather fastened on, backsliding. <span class="cmt_word">Though they called them to the Most High, none at all would exalt him</span>; margin, <span class="accented">together they exalted him not</span>. This second clause signifies either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the prophets called Israel from their idols to the Host High, yet none exalted him (literally, "together they did not or would not exalt him") by abandoning their idols and abstaining from backsliding; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "though they call him (Israel) upwards, yet not one of them all will lift himself up," that is, they together - one and all - refused or neglected to lift themselves upward towards God or goodness. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, so that it signifies, according to Keil, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "suspended," "hung up, hanging fast upon," "impaled on; ' Hengstenberg, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "swaying about from inconstancy," and "in danger of falling away;" but Pusey seems to combine both in the original sense of the word, and explains it as follows: "Literally, hung to it! as we say, 'a man's whole being <span class="accented">hangs</span> on a thing.' A thing <span class="accented">hung to</span> or on another sways to and fro within certain limits, but its relation to that on which it is hung remains immovable, Its power of motion is restrained within these limits. So Israel, so the sinner, however he veer to and fro in the details and circumstances of his sin, is fixed and immovable in his adherence to his sin itself." Though Rashi and the Targum of Jonathan make <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span> as synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;</span>, thus: "When the prophets teach them to return to me, they are in suspense whether <span class="accented">to return</span> or not to return; with difficulty do they return to me," - they are, however, distinguished as turning away from and turning to <span class="accented">God - aversion frets</span> anal <span class="accented">conversion to him</span>; while the suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span> is objective, that is, "My people are hung to apostatizing from me." The phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is variously interpreted, by some as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "upwards," the prophets being the subject; thus Rashi: "To the matter that is above him (Israel) the prophets call him unitedly; but my people do not lift themselves up nor desire to do it." Corruption was so deeply seated in Israel, that the idle mass gave no response to the voice of the prophets urging them upwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi both take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> as an adjective, and synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, the Most High. Kimchi explains as follows: "He says, My people oscillate between distress and freedom; sometimes distress comes upon them, and again they are in the condition of freedom, and this takes place for their <span class="accented">backsliding</span> from me, as if he said, because of the backsliding and rebellion which they practice against me... The prophets call them constantly to return to <span class="accented">God most high</span>." So Aben Ezra: "The interpretation is, the callers call him <span class="accented">to the Most High</span>, and they are the prophets of God; but they all in one way raise not the head." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome takes it for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, a yoke, and renders accordingly: "But a yoke shall be imposed on them together, that is not taken away." The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span> signifies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to Gesenius and many others, "to celebrate with praises," or "extol." It is rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to lift one's self up," "rise upwards;" nor is it necessary with this sense to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;</span>, his head, with Grotius, nor yet to understand it written for or in the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, with Joseph Kimchi. Similarly the Syriac: "They call him to God, but they think together, conspire, and do not raise themselves." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d3;</span> is "all together," and therefore <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> is "no one." The LXX. translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the second clause as follows: "But God shall be angry with his precious things, and shall not at all exalt <span class="accented">him</span>," having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>

One rendering <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> gives the clause the turn of an exclamation rather than of an interrogation; thus: "How readily and justly could I [or should I, or how thoroughly could I if I punished thy rebellion as I deserved] give thee up to destruction!" We prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the ordinary rendering, by which it is treated as a question: "How shall I give thee up to the power of the enemy, and not only that, but destroy thee?" Calvin's exposition seems indeed to favor the former: "Here," he says, "God consults what he is to do with the people; and first, indeed, he shows that it was his purpose to execute vengeance such as the Israelites deserved, even wholly to destroy them; but yet he assumes the character of one deliberating, that none might think that he hastily fell into anger, or that, being soon excited by excessive fury, he devoted to ruin those who had lightly sinned, or were guilty of no great crimes By these expressions of the text God shows what the Israelites deserved, and that he was now inclined to inflict the punishment of which they were worthy, and yet not without repentance, or at least not without hesitation. He afterwards adds in the next clause, <span class="accented">This I will not do</span>; <span class="accented">my heart is within me changed</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, literally, "upon," "with," then, "in," or "within:" "My heart is turned or changed from anger to pity in me." The expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, signifies, according to Rashi, "one <span class="accented">warmed</span>," as in <a href="../../par/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>, where this same word is rendered in the Authorized Version," yearned:" "His bowels did yearn upon his brother," or "warmed towards." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> many modern interpreters understand the word in the sense of" gathering themselves together:" "<span class="accented">The</span> feelings of compassion gathered themselves together;" <span class="accented">nichumim</span>, from Piel <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, a noun of the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, less definite than <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, bowels, as the seat of the emotions, "<span class="accented">gathered</span> themselves together," or "were excited all at once." The cities of the plain included Admah and Zeboim, Sodom and Gomorrah, all of which, in consequence of their sins, were overthrown and perished in one common calamity. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> these cities are all named, though Admah and Zeboim are not mentioned by name in the narrative of the catastrophe contained in Genesis. Though Israel had been as guilty and deserving of wrath as these, God expresses strong reluctance to deliver them over into the hands and power of their enemies, or to give them up to destruction. His heart revolted at the thought, and turned aside from the fierceness of his anger, though so fully deserved, into the direction of mercy; a new turn was given to his feelings in the direction of compassion. All his relentings or repentings together - one and all - yearned or were at once aroused. Repenting on the part of God is an expression suited to human comprehension, implying no change of purpose on the side of God, but only a change of procedure consistent with his purpose of everlasting love. "The Law speaks in the language of the sons of men." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I <i>am</i> God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim.</span> The promise of this verse is in harmony with the spirit of compassion expressed in the preceding. It is at once the effect and evidence of that feeling of Divine compassion. God would neither execute the burning heat of his wrath, for so the words literally mean, nor destroy Ephraim utterly, or again any more as formerly. The historic event referred to may be the destruction effected by Tiglath-pileser, ally of Ahaz King of Judah against Pekah King of Israel and Rezin King of Syria, when he carried away captive the inhabitants of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali, as we read in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>, "In the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazer, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria." But while this is probably the primary allusion, there is an ulterior reference to the future restoration of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">For I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city</span> (or, <span class="accented">come into bumming wrath</span>, Keil). A reason is here assigned for the exercise of the Divine com<span class="accented">miseration</span> just expressed; this reason is God's covenant of everlasting love. He is God, and must be measured by a Divine standard - not man, implacable and revengeful; though his people's provocation had been grievous, God was in the midst of them as their God, long-suffering and steadfast to his covenant of love and purposes of mercy. He would not enter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> into the city as an enemy, and for the purpose of utter destruction, as he had entered into the cities of the plain for their entire and final ruin; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> if the alternative rendering be preferred, he would not come into burning wrath. The fiery heat or fierceness of God's wrath tends to destruction, not the amendment of the impenitent. The expression, "I will not return," may also be understood as equivalent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "I will not turn from my pity and promises;" or, "I will not turn away from Israel;" but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it suits the context better to translate on the principle of two verbs expressing one idea in a modified sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will not return to destroy," that is, "I will not again destroy Ephraim." Jerome's explanation favors the first, and is, "I will not act according to the fury of my anger, nor change from my clemency to destroy Ephraim; for I do not strike to destroy for ever, but to amend... for I am God and not man. Man punishes for this purpose of destroying; God chastises for the purpose of amending." As God, his purpose of mercy was changeless; as the Holy One in Israel, he was infinitely pure and absolutely perfect, "the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning." The meaning <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> already given of coming into the city is supported by ancient versions, Hebrew expositors, and some of the ablest Christian commentators; yet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we prefer that which understands <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> in the sense of "the heat of wrath," deriving it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> effervescence, which is that given in Keil's translation. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> an explanation strongly advocated by Bishop Lowth and adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller. It is as follows in the words of the bishop: "Jerome is almost singular in his explanation: 'I am not one of those who inhabit cities; who live according to human laws; who think cruelty justice.' Castalio follows Jerome. There is, in fact, in the latter member of the sentence, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, a parallelism and synonym to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> in the former. The future <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> has a frequentative power (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a> and 8), 'I am not accustomed to enter a city: I am not an inhabitant of a city.' For there is a beautiful opposition of the different parts: 'I am God, and not man.' This is amplified in the next line, and the antithesis a little varied: ' I am thy God, inhabiting with thee, but in a peculiar and extraordinary manner, not in the manner of men.' Nothing, I think, can be plainer or more elegant than this." The bishop's rendering of the whole verse is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I will not do according to the fervent of my wrath,<br />I will not return  to destroy Ephraim:<br />For I am God, and not man;<br />Holy in the midst of thee, though I inhabit not thy cities."</span>

But this necessitates a double ellipsis of "<span class="accented">after</span> which." They would go after the Lord in obedience to his summons. That summons is represented as far-reaching and terrible. Calling his people to return, the Lord roars as a lion, to denote at once the loudness of the call, and the awful majesty of the Lord when thus calling his people to return. "<span class="accented">As</span> a lion," says Kimchi, "<span class="accented">which</span> roars that the animals whose king he is may assemble to him, so the Israelites shall assemble on hearing the voice of the Lord when he roars." The roaring of the lion may signify his terrible judgments on Israel's enemies, when he calls his people home from the lands of their dispersion.  The result would be a speedy return of his children from the lands of the West - the countries round or beyond the Mediterranean. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt</span>. The trembling here is eager haste, or precipitate agitation, in which they would hurry home, and that from west and east and south - from west as we infer from ver. 10, from Assyria in the east and Egypt in the south. They would thus hurry as a bird home to its nest in the greenwood; as a dove no longer a silly dove, but flying home to its window. This chapter is regarded by some as ending here. Others include ver. 12.

According to this view, the prominent idea of the east wind is its fleetness, which passed into a proverb; thus Horace says, "Agents nimbos Oeior Euro." To outrun the swift and stormy east wind would represent an undertaking at once impracticable and hopeless. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the blasting influence of the east wind that is referred to, so that it is a figurative representation, not so much of what is vain and hopeless, as of what is pernicious and destructive. Thus their course was not only idle, but injurious; not only delusive, but destructive; not only fruitless, but fatal. Their career, which is thus represented, included their idolatry and foreign alliances Kimchi explains this clause as follows: "In his service of the calves he is like him who opens his mouth to the wind and feeds on it, though he cannot support life thereby." And followeth after the east wind; ' he repeats the sense in different words, and mentions the east wind because it is the strongest and most injurious of winds to the sons of men. So with them: it is not enough that the idolatry of the calves does not profit them, but it actually injures them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to "But Ephraim is an evil spirit; he has chased the east wind." <span class="cmt_word">He daily</span> (rather, <span class="accented">all the day</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>increaseth lies and desolation.</span> Some understood these words <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as descriptive of Ephraim's attitude towards Jehovah; and thus what is figuratively set forth in the first clause is here represented literally. Thus Kimchi says, "He does not turn back from his wickedness, but all the days he multiplies lying which is the worship of the calves, and so increases the desolation and destruction that shall come as a punishment for their service. And with all this he does not perceive nor return from the worship of the calves to the worship of the blessed God." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we prefer understanding the second clause of Ephraim's conduct towards his neighbor or fellow-man. Titus, Hitzig, who shows that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> cannot refer to their conduct towards Jehovah, nor could their lies and desolation continue the whole day if referred to his service. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;</span>, "<span class="accented">violence and</span> <span class="accented">robbery</span>," or "spoil," are also jointed in a similar manner in <a href="../../par/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>, to characterize men's conduct towards their neighbors. In the passage before us, if we refer the words, "lies and desolation," as we think they ought to be referred, to Ephraim's conduct towards men, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span> may be distinguished thus: the former designates low lying and fraudulent dealing; while the latter expresses that brutal violence by which dishonest men unscrupulously take possession of their neighbors' property. <span class="cmt_word">And they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt</span>. This fondness for foreign alliances is specified as a positive proof of their apostasy from, and want of confidence in, Jehovah. This is well explained by Kimchi in the following comment: "But what doeth Ephraim? When oppression of the enemy comes upon him, they make a covenant with Assyria for their assistance, and likewise with Egypt - one time with this, another time with that." The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, "to cut a covenant," has its parallel in the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and Latin <span class="accented">foedus fetire</span>, as also in the Arabic, doubtless from the circumstance of slaying the victims in its ratification. The conduct here censured is Ephraim's faithlessness to the then static covenant rather than their treacherous maneuvering in "playing off" Egypt against Assyria, and Assyria against Egypt alternately. The land of Israel abounded in oil-olive and honey, as we read in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> and elsewhere. The object of sending it to Egypt was as a present to the Egyptians to secure their interest and help against Assyria. It is thus properly explained both by Rash! and Kimchi. The former says, "And their oil they bring to Egypt to give it to them as a present that they may help them;" the latter likewise, "They bring their oil to the Egyptians for a present, for oil came to Egypt and to other lands out of the land of Israel. The land of Israel was rich in olive oil." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah; and will punish</span> (margin, <span class="accented">visit</span> <span class="accented">upon</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jacob according to his ways</span>. God here presents himself at once as plaintiff and judge, widening the range of his pleadings. The controversy with Israel takes a wider sweep, and comprehends Judah culpable, though apparently in a less degree. But though Judah comes in for a share of punishment, that punishment shall be proportionate to their delinquencies - those like Judah that sinned less shall suffer less; while the more heinous transgressors, such as Israel had proved to be, would come in for severer punishment. To Jacob, here embracing the ten tribes of Israel and the two of Judah, the chastisement would be meted out in exact accordance with his ways. The apparent contradiction between ver. 12 of last chapter, where, as most translate it, Judah is represented as ruling with God and being faithful with the saints, and the present inclusion of Judah in controversy with Jehovah, occasioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a rendering and explanation of this verse which Aben Ezra declares to be both ungrammatical and unscriptural. "He" says Aben Ezra." who explains that Judah is faithful and he shall be reproving, and asserts that Scripture makes no mention of Jehovah having a controversy against Judah, but [employs] <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> the sense being that Jehovah and Judah have a strife against Ephraim, errs from the way of Scripture and grammar, for the prophet has written above (ver. 13), 'Judah saw his wound;' 'I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plough;' and in reference to both of them he says,' Ye shall eat the fruit of lies.' He also forgets 'The herdmen of Gerar did strive with (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>) Isaac's herdmen;' 'And the people strove with Moses;' and many other places [i.e. where <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> is found with the sense of 'contending']. Therefore he joins Ephraim with Judah, and says, 'The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways, because this name (i.e. Jacob) comprehends them both (Ephraim and Judah)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The meaning is given concisely and correctly by Rashi thus: "He (Jehovah) announces to them the words of his controversy which their brethren of the house of Israel had caused him; and they should not wonder if he would punish (literally, 'visit on') Jacob according to his ways." The change in the case of Judah, Kimchi accounts for by reference to their subsequent apostasy, especially that of their kings, as follows: "Although he said, 'And Judah yet reigneth with God,' he meant, although be holds fast by the service of God in the house of the sanctuary; so afterwards they practiced evil deeds as their kings were evil; therefore he said,' Jehovah has a controversy and correction with Judah and Jacob to visit upon them according to their doings, as their kings were evil, for they did not remember my mercy with them and with their father Jacob, because the whole was for sake of his posterity; and I showed him a sign which should be to his seed after him, if they gave their heart to me.... And the sign which I showed them is only done for sake of his seed. But they have not acknowledged this, for if they had acknowledged this, they would have cleaved to me and my service, and I would have ratified to them the blessing of Jacob their father.'" The infinitive with <span class="accented">le</span> is not infrequently employed in the sense of our future, thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span>, it is to be visited, equivalent to "he shall or must visit upon it' This idiom is common in Syriac, but always with <span class="accented">atid</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>According to his doings will he recompense him.</span> The milder expression is applied to Judah - he has a controversy with him, but will punish Jacob, restricted by some to Ephraim or the ten tribes. Better understand Jacob of both Judah and Israel, who are both to be recompensed, each according to his works.

In this verse and the following the prophet looks away back into the far-distant past; and this retrospect, which is suggested by the names Jacob and Israel, reminds him of two well-known events in the life of the patriarch-The meaning and intention of this reminiscence are differently interpreted. The two leading views are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some are of opinion that the prophet means to give an example by way of warning, and to mention a trait of Jacob's overreaching cunning, and likewise of his violence, and thereby show that Jacob had incurred guilt in a manner resembling that of the then present generation; that is to say, his conduct had been like to theirs in deceit, lying, and violence. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to others, and we agree with them, the object of the prophet in these verses is to admonish them to imitate the conduct of their progenitor, and to remind them of the distinction which he had obtained thereby, as an encourage-merit to them to go and do likewise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Another interpretation, somewhat similar to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, is that of those who admit that Jacob's laying hold of his brother's heel in the womb is proposed to his posterity by the prophet for the purpose of emulation and encouragement, at the same time to exhibit God's electing grace from eternity. Thus Jerome: "While he was yet in the womb of Rebekah, he laid hold of his brother's heel, not by his own strength, it is true, who was incapable of perception, but by the mercy of God, who knows and loves those whom he has predestinated." So also Rashi: "All this I have done to him; he took his brother by the heel for a sign that he would prevail over him." Calvin explains more fully thus: "Their ingratitude is showed in this, that they did not acknowledge that they had been anticipated, in the person of their father Jacob, by the gratuitous mercy of God. The first history is indeed referred to for this end, that the posterity of Jacob might understand that they had been elected by God before they were born. For Jacob did not, by choice or design, lay hold of the heel of his brother in his mother's womb; but it was an extraordinary thing. It was, then, God who guided the hand of the infant and by this sign testified his adoption to be gratuitous. In short, by saying that Jacob held the foot of his brother in his mother's womb, the same thing is intended as if God had reminded the Israelites that they did not excel other people by their own virtue or that of their parents, but that God of his own good pleasure had chosen them." Aben Ezra and Kimchi explain the seizing of Esau's heel by Jacob as owing to the impartation of Divine power, but as a sign of victory over his enemies. We must reject <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The reference is not to <a href="../../par/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>, where <span class="accented">Jacob's</span> overreaching Esau is recorded, but to <a href="../../par/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>, where it is written, "<span class="accented">After</span> that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the patriarchs are always exhibited as patterns of piety - <span class="accented">besides, Ho</span>sea never employs the name Israel in any but an honorable sense. We must elect between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>; and we incline to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, as the gist of the passage is to exhibit Jacob's earnestness in seeking the Divine blessing as an example to his posterity. Already in his mother's womb, before he saw the light of the world even in his condition of <span class="accented">unconsciousness</span>, he had laid hold of the heel of his elder brother Esau, in order to anticipate him as the firstborn, and thereby appropriate the Divine promises. The second clause describes how with zeal, by labor and effort, he had struggled for the position of pre-eminence, sorely struggling for the Divine blessing. In the maturity of his manhood he wrestled with God, or rather with the angel of the covenant, and prevailed so that his name was changed to Israel. This picture the prophet presents to Jacob's posterity for their imitation, with implied promise of like happy result. Though Aben Ezra and Kimchi, in their exposition of the verse, rather explain in their own way the significance of the original event as recorded in Genesis than the application which the prophet here makes of it, yet it may not be out of place to subjoin their comments, which are as follows: Aben Ezra, "With respect to him who explains 'in the womb' in the sense that Jehovah then decreed the matter of the birthright and blessing, I know not how the meaning of 'in the womb' bears on that, as the Scripture <span class="accented">says</span>, 'Before I formed thee in the womb I knew thee.' According to my opinion it should be taken according to its literal sense, that ' he took his brother by the heel in the womb; ' and this is made clear by' and his hand took hold on Esau's heel.' Now the purport is, 'Why do the sons of Jacob not remember that I chose their father, and effected preeminence for him over all that are born? For when he was in the womb I gave him strength to lay hold of the heel, and this was as the working of a miracle, for the fetus has, in the womb and at the time of the opening of the matrix, no strength to lay hold of anything until it comes forth from the womb into the air of the world. And lo! when he was in the womb I gave him strength; and afterwards he wrestled with the angel, and he (the angel) did not prevail over him, although one angel <span class="accented">slew</span> the whole host of Assyria, and from his sight the children of men flee in terror as David who was frightened; how much <span class="accented">was</span> it to wrestle with him.' The meaning is that all the children of the world should know that his (<span class="accented">Jacob's</span>) seed shall endure for ever, and in the end conquer his enemies. But Ephraim thinks that Ephraim himself has found the power." The comment of Kimchi on the first part of the verse is much the same with that of Aben Ezra just cited; while on the concluding clause he remarks, "And yet another sign I have shown him to be a sign to his children after him, for I gave him strength to wrestle with the angel and to be a prince in relation to him as if he was in the same rank with him. And this sign I showed him that his sons would be the portion of Jehovah alone, that star and angel should not prevail over them all the time they would do my pleasure, and by the signs of the heavens they should not be terrified, for they have no strength (physical) nor power (moral) over them, because the providence of God most blessed cleaves to them during all the period they would do my will, nor shall they succumb to any accident of time." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him <i>in</i> Bethel, and there he spake with us;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him.</span> As Jacob's position at birth symbolized the pre-eminence which God's electing love had in store for him, and as in his manhood's prime he put forth such earnestness and energy to obtain the blessing, so Israel, by the example of their forefather, are encouraged to like strenuous exertion with like certainty of success. The example is more fully described and dwelt on in this verse for the purpose of more powerfully stimulating the Israelites of the prophet's day to imitate it. From this verse we learn the following facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the nature of the conflict as of a spiritual kind; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the visible embodiment of the invisible deity, so that the angel is not an entire identification with God in the preceding verse, but the organ of Divine manifestation; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the weapons used, or the means employed, namely, weeping and supplication, in a word, the instrumentality of prayer; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the true way of prevailing with God, which is real humility and sin-core supplication, not stiff, necked and defiant resistance to the Divine will and word, like that of Israel at the period in question. This verse "is," according to Aben Ezra, "<span class="accented">an</span> explanation how he put forth prowess with God." Kimchi regards it as "the repetition of the same thought for the put. pose of intensifying, for it was a great wonder for a man to wrestle with an angel." <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> commences a new clause; while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the punctuation of it as a participle, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;</span>, and the connection of it with "prevailed," leaves the following clause isolated without any improvement of the sense. The rendering in this latter case would be "prevailed weeping," a somewhat awkward expression. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> there is an exposition adopted by the Hebrew expositors and advocated by Hitzig, which appears to us to do violence to the true signification of the passage. Thus Rashi: "And the angel besought him, ' Let me now go. The end of the Holy and Blessed One is that he may reveal himself to thee in Bethel, and there shalt thou find him.'" Similarly Aben Ezra: "He (the angel) almost wept and supplicated him to let him go. And the signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e9;</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>, is: 'before the light strengthened, that Jacob might not be alarmed.'" Also Kimchi: "This is not mentioned in the Thorah; and the explanation is as if the angel wept and supplicated Jacob to let him go, as he said, 'Let me go, for' the day breaketh.'" Such exposition introduces into the text an intolerable anthropopathism. Jerome long before had given the correct explanation thus: "<span class="accented">He</span> wept and asked him, when he said, 'I will not let thee go, unless thou shalt have blessed me!' For the wrestling was that which he engaged in with the angel, holding him by prayers that he might bless him, not by the strength of work. If any one weeps and exercises penitence, and supplicates the Lord, he shall find him in the grief of his heart, and when he has invoked him, he shall hear him answering." <span class="cmt_word">He found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us.</span> The prophet here records the result of Jacob's faithful wrestling. Them in Bethel, the very place where years after idolatry and immorality found a home, God had manifested himself to the patriarch. The fruit of Jacob's victory was that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he found God at Bethel; not that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> God found him, as some explain it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The historical basis of the prophet's statement is not <a href="../../par/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>, which narrates the appearance of God to the patriarch as he fled into Mesopotamia, but <a href="../../par/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>, when the new name of Israel, "prince with God," was confirmed to him, and the promise of all the families of the earth being blessed through his seed renewed. Of the two visions at Bethel the second is the one here referred to, as it comes after that at Penuel, the scene of the patriarch's wrestling with the angel; while the accompanying circumstances keep us to the right understanding of the expression, "He found him in Bethel," which we are considering. Jacob on that memorable occasion prepared himself and household for seeking God by putting away the strange gods that were among them, by ceremonial purifications, and putting on change of garments. Thus, seeking with holy purpose and prepared heart, he found the Lord at Bethel, and enjoyed heavenly fellowship with him there. Aben Ezra favors <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> making Jehovah, not Jacob, the subject; thus: "As he was returning to his father, the angel found him there; and because the angel appeared to him twice in Bethel, behold the place is the gate of heaven; therefore I and Amos have prophesied about Jeroboam at Bethel, which is the place of his kingdom." Kimchi approves of the exposition of the angel finding Jacob, but mentions a modification of that of Jacob finding the angel; thus: "The angel found him in Bethel and also blessed him there; and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, equivalent to 'found him,' is the future instead of the past. But my lord my father, of blessed memory, explains it according to its literal import, that the angel said to him (when wrestling with him) that he would find him in Bethel The blessed God announced to him the good tidings that he would there manifest himself to him and call his name Israel." The last clause of this verse states the additional fact that God spoke <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> through the patriarch to his posterity. "Let it be observed," says Lackemacher, as quoted by Keil, "that God is said to have talked at Bethel, not with Jacob only, but with all his posterity. That is to say, the things which are here said to have been done by Jacob, and to have happened to him, had not regard to himself only, but to all the race that sprang from him, and were signs of the good fortune which they either would or certainly might enjoy." Though the suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, in the Massoretic text is well attested, yet, instead of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the third person, Ewald reads it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> as the first plural, and consequently so renders the word that the clause implies, not a narrative of the past, but a prophecy of the future; thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "He will find at Bethel, and there he will speak with us." The. Septuagint, again, with other Greek versions, as also the Syriac and Arabic, read in the last part of the clause <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>, equivalent "to him," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "us," which identifies the patriarch with his posterity. The translation by which a relative is understood before <span class="accented">immanu, equiva</span>lent to "Them he spoke to Jacob the things that are with <span class="accented">us</span>," or "happened us," or "pertained to us," is neither necessary nor in accordance with good taste. Kimchi understands the verb in the present tense that is, God speaks <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">with us</span> - Hosea and the other prophets, to reprove the idolatry rampant in Bethel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> rather with the  prophet and the people descended from the patriarch. On the words, "there he spake with us," Kimchi comments as follows: "These are the words of the prophet. He says, ' There in Bethel he (Jehovah) speaks with me and with Amos to reprove Israel for the worship of the calf in Bethel,' as Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>) says, 'Seek ye me, and ye shall live: but seek not Bethel.' But my lord my father, of blessed memory, explained 'And there he will speak with us' as the words of the angel. He (the angel) says to him (Jacob), 'The blessed God will find us in Bethel, and there he will speak <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> with us, with me and with thee, in order to confirm to thee my blessing, and to call thy name Israel, saying, For as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.'" But others, as Saadia Gaon, explain the word, not in the sense of "with us," but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> "on account of us," or "about us." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/12-5.htm">Hosea 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD <i>is</i> his memorial.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even the Lord God of hosts; the Lord is his memorial.</span> Here we have at once a confirmation and a pledge of previous promises. Jacob had wronged Esau, and thereby incurred his displeasure; he had offended God by the injury inflicted on his brother. He is consequently in a position of peril with respect to both God and man; he repented of his sin, and with many and bitter tears supplicated safety - salvation in the highest sense. Jacob, or Israel, in Hosea's time were involved in greater guilt and exposed to greater danger; the same unfailing remedy is recommended to them, and the same way of safety is laid open before them; let them only repent, turn to the Lord, and with tears of genuine sorrow seek his face and favor free; and the prospect would soon brighten before them. The Name of God was a sufficient guarantee: he is Jehovah the Everlasting, and therefore <span class="accented">Unchanging</span> One - the same to Jacob's posterity as he had been to the patriarch himself, equally ready to accept their repentance and equally willing to bless them with safety and salvation. He is God of hosts, and thus the <span class="accented">Almighty</span> One, governing all creatures, guiding all events, commanding all powers both heavenly and earthly, and ruling the whole history of humanity. His name is a remembrancer of all this, and thus his people were assured that he neither lacks the will nor the power to bless them with all needful blessings, and do them greatest good. The name of an individual is that whereby he is known; on mention of his name the memory of him is recalled. The mention of the Divine Name not only reminds us of his being and Godhead, but recalls to our memory his attributes. Rashi has the following brief comment on this verse: "As I have been from the beginning, so am I now; and if ye had walked with me in uprightness as Jacob our father, I would have dealt with you as dealt with him." Thus to Abram in a land of strangers, imperiled and defenseless, God revealed himself as God Almighty; to Moses, after centuries of unfulfilled promise, he made himself known as the Unchanging One, still challenging the confidence of his people; to Hosea he brings to mind his unchanging counsel in regard to all the events of time and his unlimited control over all the realms of space and their inhabitants, and so the suitability of his attributes to the multiplied necessities and varying circumstances of his people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</span> God's character in itself, and his conduct towards the great forefather of the Hebrew race, call at once for confidence and contrition. The evidence of their repentance is twofold: one aspect is manward, consisting of mercy and judgment; the other is Godward, being a constant waiting upon God. The literal rendering brings out the meaning more clearly; it is, "And thou, in [or, 'by'] thy God thou shalt return." If we render the preposition by "in," we may understand it to imply entire dependence on God, or close and cordial fellowship with God; if we take it to mean "by," it signifies the power or help of God; while the return is moral and spiritual, with perhaps material and literal restoration implied A parallel for b<span class="accented">e</span> in the signification of "by" occurs in the first chapter of this book at the seventh verse: "I will save them by (<span class="accented">be</span>) the Lord their God;" also in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>, "O people saved by (<span class="accented">be</span>) the Lord." We prefer the former sense as more simple and suitable; it is concisely and correctly explained by Keil as follows: "'<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> is a pregnant expression, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, 'So turn as to enter into vital fellowship with God; ' that is, to be truly converted.... The next two clauses are to be taken as explanatory of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>. The conversion is to show itself i, the perception of love and right towards their brethren, and in constant trust in God." The difference between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> is that the latter signifies "to return <span class="accented">to</span>," and the former "to return into," and thus expresses inward union with him. The general sense of the clause is thus expressed by Aben Ezra: "If thou wouldst return to God, he would be thy help to bring thee back to him;" and by Kimchi as follows: "But thou who art the seed of Jacob, if thou art willing, canst return unto thy God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou canst rest in him, as 'In returning and rest shall ye be saved' (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>)." The second point of the verse has an instructive parallel in <a href="../../par/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" In regard to the waiting upon God, of which the last clause speaks, Aben Ezra has the pithy remark, "Depend not upon thy riches nor thy strength, for the strength thou hadst from him, also the riches." Kimchi comments on the same more fully, as follows: "On this condition thou canst rest and not be afraid of the enemy, if thou wilt observe to do mercy and judgment: for his conditions are as he said, 'I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.' And although he does not mention righteousness here, yet he has said in another place, 'Keep ye judgment, and to justice [literally, 'righteousness'].' And he says here, 'And wait upon thy God continually;' now it is righteousness and equity that thou waitest on thy God continually. And even when thou shalt have great possession and riches and wealth, thou shalt say to thyself, ' It is all from him; thou shall remember him continually and wait on him, as he says in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>), ' Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; not like Ephraim, who says, 'I am become rich, I have found me out substance.'" The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>, equivalent to "draw near <span class="accented">to</span>," having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>.

To this the prophet is led by the preceding train of thought. When he called to mind the earnestness of the patriarch to obtain the blessing, the sincerity of his repentance, and the evidences of conversion, consisting in mercy and judgment and constant waiting on God, he looks around on Israel, and finding those virtues conspicuous by their absence., he repeats the story of their degeneracy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is a merchant</span> (margin, <span class="accented">Canaan</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress</span>. This verse is more exactly rendered, <span class="accented">Canaan is he, in his hand are the balances of deceit: he loveth to oppress</span>. How the sons have degenerated from the sire! No longer do we see Jacob wrestling in prayer with the angel of the covenant, and knighted in the field with the name of Israel, or "prince with God;" but a fraudulent merchant <span class="accented">Kenaan</span>, seeking to aggrandize himself by cheating and oppression. His conduct is the opposite of what God requires; instead of the mercy and judgment and trust in God enjoined in the preceding verse, we have the Canaanitish (Phoenician) trader, with his false scales in his hand and the love of oppression in his heart. The word Kenaan sometimes denotes <span class="accented">Canaan</span>, the son of Ham, and ancestor of the Canaanitish nation; sometimes the <span class="accented">land of Canaan</span>, or lowlands (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, bow the knee, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">genu</span>, knee; then "to be low" or "depressed") as opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, or" highlands" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, to be high); sometimes <span class="accented">Phoenicia</span>, the northern part of Canaan; also, from the Canaanites or Phoenicians having been famous as merchants, a <span class="accented">man of Canaan</span>, or any <span class="accented">merchant</span>, so <a href="../../par/job/40.htm">Job 40</a>:30 and <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>, just as <span class="accented">Kasdi Chaldaean</span> is applied to an astrologer. At the time of Hosea, the Phoenicians were the great merchants who had the commerce of the world in their hand. Canaan is thus a figurative designation of Ephraim in their degenerate condition as indicated by the false balances and love of oppression. The verse is well explained by Theodoret: "And thou, Ephraim, imitating <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">wickedness of Canaan</span>, hast an unjust balance of mind: thou despisest justice, thou greedily desirest unjust power, thou art high-minded in rich, S, and dost arrogate to thyself very much in prescribing and determining the conditions thereof." Rashi more briefly remarks, "Ye depend upon your wealth because ye are merchants and defraud; and of your riches ye say, 'Yet I have become rich, and shall not serve the Holy One;'" while Kimchi marks the contrast between Israel as he ought to be and Israel as he actually is, thus: "But thou art not so (i.e. practicing love and righteousness), but thou art like the Canaanite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">the merchant</span>, in whose hand is the deceitful balance." The character of the Phoenician trader is thus given in the 'Odyssey' - "A false Phoenician of insidious mind, Vers'd in vile arts, and foe to humankind." But, in addition to secret fraud, open violence is here charged against Israel.

In the former sense the clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may allude to the injunction contained in ver. 6 to wait on God, and may signify, "No doubt I have become rich, yet not through Divine help, but by my own exertions;" in the latter sense it may signify, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I have only become rich; I have done nothing else; I have done nothing amiss" Aben Ezra regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> as introducing the apodosis, and explains it nearly in the sense of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (1)</span>, thus: "The sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;</span> is, 'God has not given me the wealth, <span class="accented">but</span> I by myself [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my own unaided efforts] have become rich, for I am not as the Canaanite,' that is, the merchant, as 'There shall be no more the Canaanite' (<a href="../../par/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>) ;" he then proceeds to show the connection, "And the meaning [according to the context] is, 'Why does he say, Keep mercy and judgment, and be not an oppressor like the Canaanite [nor am I]? yet all is my own honest earning; none of the sons of men shall find that I have sinned.'" The interpretation of Kimchi is similar, but somewhat simpler, thus: "The words, 'I am become rich,' are the opposite of 'Wait on thy God continually.' But he (Ephraim) does not wait on God the blessed, and he does not acknowledge that he gave him strength to acquire wealth, but says, 'My own power and the strength of my hands have made for me this wealth,' and he forgetteth God the blessed, who gave him power to work, as it is written in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>), 'And thou forget the Lord thy God.' This is what he (the prophet) means by 'I have become rich;' he means to say, 'I have become rich from myself,'" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by my own labor. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> denotes both physical or bodily strength, and also, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, riches, Latin <span class="accented">opes, prob</span>ably as procured thereby. The flourishing state of the kingdom during the reigns of Joash and Jeroboam II. may have induced their overweening self-confidence and their amazing forgetfulness of God, and at the same time this surprising ignorance of their real condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f55;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I have found refreshment for myself," and Jerome, "Inveni mihi idolum," as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;</span> had been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In all my labors they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin</span>; margin, <span class="accented">all my labors suffice me not:</span> he shall bare <span class="accented">punishment of iniquity in whom is sin</span>. Here two modes of construction are possible and each has had its advocates; thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the <span class="accented">subject</span> of the verb, as in the LXX., which is, "None of his labors shall be found available for him on account of the sins he has committed." This is the rendering followed and interpreted by Cyril and Theodoret. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The words in question, instead of being taken as the subject to the verb, may be employed <span class="accented">absolutely</span> or with the ellipsis of a preposition, as in the Authorized Version; thus: "As to my labors, or the fruits of my labors," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, is used in both senses. The meaning of the passage then is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, besides the sins of fraud and oppression, Ephraim did not shrink through shame to vindicate his conduct and to maintain that. in all the riches he had acquired with such labor, no one could show that those riches had been unjustly acquired by him, or that there was sin contracted in their acquisition. Thus Kimchi: "He (the prophet) mentions another vice, saying that he (Ephraim) oppresses, and asserts that, in all he has labored for and gathered together, they shall not be able to find <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> any riches of iniquity and sin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> is the same as iniquity <span class="accented">and</span> sin, and thus (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) 'it is good and comely' (<span class="accented">asher</span> here also for <span class="accented">ray</span>). Or the explanation of it is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> They shall not find with me iniquity. nor any matter in which there is sin pertaining to me. And <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is less than <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span> iniquity, for sin comes sometimes by reason of error. Or the explanation of 'iniquity which were sin' is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Iniquity in which there was sin to me; as if he said, with regard to which I had sinned; for if riches came into my hand through iniquity and robbery, it was not with my knowledge; he means: so that I sinned in relation to it, and took it by iniquity with my knowledge; and in this way (<a href="../../par/leviticus/22-16.htm">Leviticus 22:16</a>) 'they lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span> being in construct state, that is to say, iniquity with regard to which they trespassed." <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> signifies "belonging to me;" while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d0;</span> is read, not as a noun, but as a verb in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Chaldee, which is explained by Rashi, gives an explanation identical, though only partially so, with the marginal rendering of the Authorized Version, namely, "It were good for thee if thou consideredst with thyself: all my riches do not suffice me, in order to expiate the iniquity which I have committed." This, and the marginal reading - both where they coincide and where they diverge - we must unhesitatingly reject as far-fetched, artificial, and having no real basis in the text. To their other sins Israel added this protestation of innocence, which was the solemn protestation of a falsehood. The clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> may admit another sense; thus: If in ray gains by labor iniquity should be found, that indeed would be sin; but such is not the case. Thus, like the Pharisees of a later age, did they justify themselves before men; but God knew their hollow-hearted hypocrisy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I <i>that am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</span> This verse consists of two parts which in the original are coordinated; but in the Authorized Version the one is subordinated to the other by supplying an awkward and unnecessary ellipsis. It is better, therefore, to translate thus: And I <span class="accented">am the Lord thy God, from the land of Egypt: I will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. Some understand this verse as a threatening; not a few as a promise; while others combine both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Theodoret, who may be taken as representing the first class of interpreters, comments thus: "That thou mayest understand this and learn wisdom by thy calamity, I will bring thee back again to that point that thou must again dwell in tents and wander as an exile in a foreign land." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi may represent those who understand it as a promise, or rather a promise with an implied threatening, and thus combine both. His exposition is as follows: "Even so am I ready to bring you forth out of the captivity where ye shall Be, as I did when I brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, and sustained you in the wilderness and made you dwell in tents; so am I ready yet again, when I shall have brought you forth out of the lands of the Gentiles, to cause you to dwell in tents in the wilderness by the way, and to show you wonders until ye shall return to your land in peace." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Wunsche rejects both the preceding, and refers the statement to the other, present time, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, not in the sense of "yet again," but in the equally allowable meaning of "further," or "still further;" thus his rendering of the verse is, "And yet I am thy God from Egypt, still I let thee dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast." Thus we have a remembrance of God's goodness to Israel all along from the Exodus to the time then present, including the celebration of their feasts, especially that of Taber-uncles, the most joyful of them all. This is favored by the interpretation of Aben Ezra, which is the following: "The sense is, 'Shouldst thou not remember that I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt in great riches for which thou didst not labor, and nourished thee in the wilderness when thou wast in tents?' In like manner he shall be able to do unto thee as in the days of the solemn feast of thy coming out of Egypt." We prefer, notwithstanding, the exposition number <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, which includes, or rather implies, a threatening of being driven out of their good laud into a wilderness state, because of their forgetfulness of, and ingratitude to, God, as also because of their proud self-confidence; while, with this implied threat of punishment, God holds out to them the promise and prospect of like guiding care and sheltering guardianship, as in that early period of their history, the remembrance of which was still kept up by the <span class="accented">mo'ed</span>, or Feast of Tabernacles, during the seven days of which the people dwelt in booths, in commemoration of their having dwelt in booths in the wilderness after they had been delivered out of the land of Egypt. Thus, as Hengstenberg has well observed, "the preterit is changed into a future through the ingratitude of the nation." Vers. 10 and 11 prove God's continual care for the spiritual welfare and best interests of Israel all along, and, at the same time, the inexcusableness of Israel in forgetting God and in arrogating to themselves the power of controlling their own destinies in the matter of wealth and prosperity; while multiplied prophecies and visions testified to both, vie. to God's care and Israel's recklessness of warnings. Moreover, their persistence in sin prepared them for and precipitated the punishment.

He (Jehovah) says, 'What could I do to you and I did not do it, so that ye should not forget me? And what did I do with your fathers? I spoke constantly with the prophets to admonish you from me, and I multiplied visions to you many days.'" The Authorized Version <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> employs "by" as the equivalent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> here. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'anoki</span> is emphatic, viz. "I even I," as though he said, "I and not another;" while the preterit proves Jehovah to have continued his visions to the very moment at which the prophet speaks. To the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> use similitudes, some supply a verbal noun of corporate sense, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This, however, is unnecessary, as a verb often includes its cognate noun, of which we have several similar ellipses, e.g. <a href="../../par/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, "They bare <span class="accented">children</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> understood] to them;" also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, "They shall set themselves in array [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> understood] against her." The LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> has <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was represented; "and Jerome renders it <span class="accented">assimilatus sum</span>. The three modes of Divine communication here referred to are prediction, vision, and similitude. The word for <span class="accented">vision</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, is used here as a collective; it differs from the dream in being higher degree of Divine revelation, also the senses of the receiver are awake and active, while in the dream they are inoperative and passive. Of the <span class="accented">similitude</span>, again, we have examples in Isaiah's parable of a vineyard (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>.), and in Ezekiel's similitude of a wretched infant, to represent the natural state of Jerusalem. Aben Ezra remarks, I have established emblems and comparisons that ye might understand me;" and Kimchi, "I have given emblems and parables by means of the prophets, as Isaiah says, 'My well-beloved hath a vineyard;' and Ezekiel, 'Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan.' And the explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> is that by their hand he sends them emblems and similitudes as (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>) 'which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses'" Thus God, as Rosenm&uuml;ller observes, "left no means of admonishing them untried." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 11</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity.</span> In reference to hypotheticals, Driver remarks, "With an <span class="accented">imperfect</span> in protasis.

The first part of this clause has been variously rendered. Some take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> affirmatively, in the sense <span class="accented">of certainly, assuredly</span>; others translate it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> interrogatively, as in the Authorized Version, though even thus it would be more accurately rendered: <span class="accented">Is Gilead iniquity of</span> Pusey, following the common version, explains it as follows: 'The prophet asks the question in order to answer it more peremptorily. He raises the doubt in order to crush it the more impressively.' Is there iniquity in Gilead? 'Alas I there was nothing else. <span class="accented">Surely they are vanity</span>; or, strictly, <span class="accented">they have become merely vanity</span>." There does not appear, however, sufficient reason for departing from the ordinary meaning of the word, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> namely, <span class="accented">if</span> thus, <span class="accented">If Gilead i, iniquity</span> (worthlessness), <span class="accented">surely they have become vanity</span>. The clause thus rendered may denote one of two things - either - (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) moral worthlessness followed by physical nothingness, that is, moral decay followed by physical - sin succeeded by suffering; or (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) progress in moral corruption. To the former exposition corresponds the comment of Kimchi, as follows: "'If Gilead began to work vanity (nothingness),' for they began to do wickedness first, and they have been first carried into captivity. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> can connect itself with what precedes, so that its meaning is about Gilead which he has mentioned, and the sense would be repeated in different words. Or its sense shall be in connection with Gilgal. And although zakeph is on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, all the accents of the inter. prefers do not follow after the accents of the points." Similarly Rashi: "If disaster and oppression come upon them (the Gileadites) they have caused it to themselves, for certainly they are worthlessness, and sacrifies bullocks to idols in Gilgal. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is a prophetic perfect implying the certainty of the prediction, as though already an accomplished fact." The exposition of Aben Ezra favors (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>); thus: "If the Gileadites, before I sent prophets to them, were worthlessness, surely they have become vanity, that is, instead of being morally better, they have become worse." To this exposition we find a parallel in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, "They have walked after vanity, and are become vain." <span class="cmt_word">They sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>. The inhabitanta of Gilgal on the west were no better than the Gileadites on the east of Jordan; the whole kingdom, in fact, was overrun with idolatry. The sin of the people of Gilgal did not consist in the animals offered, but in the unlawfulness of the place of sacrifice. The punishment of both Gilgal and Gilead is denounced in the following part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</span> Gilead signified" heap of witnesses," and Gilgal "heaping heap. The latter was mentioned in <a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a> and Hosea 9:15 as a notable center of idol-worship ("all their wickedness is in Gilgal") and retained, as we learn from the present passage, its notoriety for unlawful sacrifices, sacrifices customarily and continually offered (viz. iterative sense of Piel); the former was signalized in <a href="../../par/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8</a> as "a city of them that work iniquity," and "polluted with blood." The altars in both places are to be turned into stone-heaps; this is expressed by a play on words so frequent in Hebrew; at Gilead as well as Gilgal they are to become <span class="accented">gallim</span>, or heaps of stones, such as husbandmen gather off ploughed and leave in useless heaps for the greater convenience of removal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (related to toll, a hill, that which is thrown up) is a furrow as formed by casting up or tearing into. The ruinous heaps of the altars implied, not only their destruction, but the desolation of the country. The altars would become dilapidated heaps, and the country depopulated. The Hebrew interpreters, however, connect with the heap-like altars the idea of number and conspicuousness: this they make prominent as indicating the gross idolatry of the people. Thus Rabbi: "Their altars are numerous as heaps in the furrows of the field. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;</span> is the furrow of the plougher, called <span class="accented">telem</span>;" Aben Ezra: "<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> is by way of figure, because they were numerous and conspicuous." Pococke combines with the idea of number that of ruinous heaps - "rude heaps of stones, in his sight; and such they should become, no one stone being left in order upon another." Kimchi's comment on the verse is the following: "The children of Gilgal were neighbors to the land of Gilead, only the Jordan was between them; they learnt also their ways (doings), and began to serve idols like them, and to practice iniquity and vanity, and sacrificed oxen to strange gods in the place where they had raised an altar to Jehovah the blessed, and where they had set up the tabernacle at the first after they had passed over Jordan: there also they sacrificed oxen to their idols. Not enough that they made an altar in Gilgal to idols, but they also built outside the city altars many and conspicuous, like heaps of stones on the furrows of the field."

And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved</span>. The connection of this verse with what precedes has been variously explained. The flight of Israel and his servitude are intended, according to Umbreit, "to bring out the double servitude of Israel - the first, the one which the people had to endure in their forefather; the second, the one which they had to endure themselves in Egypt." Cyril and Theodoret understand them to give prominence to Jacob's zeal for the blessing of the birthright, and his obedience to the command of God and his parents. Pusey says, "Jacob chose poverty and servitude rather than marry an idolatress of Canaan. He knew not whence, except from God's bounty and providence, he should have bread to eat or raiment to put on; with his staff alone he passed over Jordan. His voluntary poverty, bearing even unjust losses, and repaying the things which he never took, reproved their dishonest traffic; his trustfulness in God, their mistrust; his devotedness to God, their alienation from him and their devotion to idols." There may be an element of truth in each of these explanations, and an approximation to the true sense; but none of them tallies exactly with the context. There is a contrast between the flight of the lonely tribe-father across the Syrian desert, and the guidance of his posterity by a prophet of the Lord through the wilderness; Jacob's servitude in Padan-aram with Israel's redemption from the bondage of Egypt; the guarding of sheep by the patriarch with the Shepherd of Israel's guardian-care of them by his prophet when he led them to Canaan. Thus the distress and affliction of Jacob are contrasted with the exaltation of his posterity. The great object of this contrast is to impress the people with the goodness of God to them in lifting them up out of the lowest condition, and to inspire them with gratitude to God for such unmerited elevation and with thankful yet humble acknowledgment of his mercy. Calvin's explanation is at once correct and clear; it is the following: "Their father Jacob, who was he? what was his condition? He was a fugitive from his country. Even if he had always lived at home, his father was only a stranger in the land. But he was compelled to fit into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was with his uncle, no doubt, but he was treated quite as meanly as any common slave: he served for a wife. And how did he serve? He was the man that tended the cattle." This, it may be observed, was the lowest and the meanest, the hardest and worst kind of servitude. In like manner Ewald directs attention to the wonderful care of Divine providence manifested to Jacob in his straits, in his flight to Syria, in his sojourn there as a shepherd, and also to Israel his posterity delivered out of Egypt by the hand of Moses an, I sustained in the wilderness so that one scarcely knows what to think of Israel who, without encountering such perils and distresses, and out of sheer delight in iniquity, so shamefully forsook their benefactor. Such is the substance of Ewald's view, which presents one aspect of the ease, though he does not bring out so fully the fact of Israel's elevation and the humble thankfulness that should be exhibited therefore. The exposition of the Hebrew commentators agrees in the main with what we have given. Rashi says, "Jacob fled to the field of Aram, etc., as a man who says, 'Let us return to the former narrative which we spoke of above;' and he wrestles with the angel; and this further have I done unto him; as he was obliged to fly to the field of Aram ye know how I guarded him, and for a wife he kept sheep." "Ye ought to consider," says Aben Ezra, "that your father when he fled to Syria was poor, and so he says, 'And he will give me bread to eat' (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>). And he served for a wife,' and this is, 'Have I not served thee for Rachel?' 'And for a wife he kept sheep ;' and ' f made him rich.'" The exposition of Kimchi is much fuller, and is as follows: "And they do not remember the goodness which I exercised with their father, when he fled from his brother Esau. Yea, when he was there it was necessary for him to serve Laban for a wife, that he should give him his daughter, and the service consisted in keeping his sheep, and so for the other daughter which he gave him he kept his sheep in like manner. And I am he that was with him and blessed him, so that he returned thence with fiches and substance. And further, I showed favor to his sons who descended into Egypt and were in bondage there; and I sent to them a prophet who brought them up out of Egypt with much substance, and he was Moses. The forty years they were in the wilderness they were guarded by means of a prophet whom I gave them, and they wanted nothing. But all these benefits they forget, and provoke me to anger by abominations and no-gods."

Rashi has a similar rendering of the word <span class="accented">retheth</span>, which is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and causes the diversity of translation in this clause; but his exposition of the whole sentence is vague and unsatisfactory. Referring it to Jeroboam of the tribe of Ephraim, he explains as follows: "When Jeroboam, zealous for God, spoke against Solomon hard words, and with terror, Solomon was a great king." Pococke's exposition is in harmony with the Authorized Version, and is the following: "When Ephraim spake with fear and trembling (like his forefather Jacob, in his humble supplication to God), he exalted himself in Israel." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the rendering adopted by most moderns, is decidedly preferable, as agreeing better with the context, and much more in bar-runny with tribal characteristics of Ephraim, as intimated in this very book, and exhibited elsewhere. The translation we thus prefer is: "When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he, even he, exalted himself in Israel." Such was the fear inspired, and the deference paid to the authority of that powerful tribe. The word <span class="accented">reheth</span>, though not found elsewhere, has a cognate root in Aramaic, with the meaning here assigned to it; for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> is to fear, shudder, tremble; there is also, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, equivalent to "fear," similar in both sense and sound. The Chaldee supports this rendering; its paraphrase is: "When one of the house of Ephraim spake, trembling seized the peoples." Also Aben Ezra and Kimchi. The former's brief comment is: "Before his speaking the peoples were afraid; and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> has no analogue except in the Aramaic." Kimchi's explanation is, "From the beginning, before Ephraim sinned, the fear of him was great over the peoples who surrounded him; for when he spake, fear and trembling were wont to seize him who heard him; and he was great and strong among the tribes of Israel, as it was said of him, ' And his seed shall be a multitude of nations.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. renders <span class="accented">reheth</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, thus:" According to the word of Ephraim, be adopted ordinances for himself in Israel," that is, when Ephraim spoke, the rest of the Israelites assented to his ordinances and rights, reverencing his authority, so that the general sense differs little from the Chaldee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller constructs and explains differently; his exposition runs somehow thus: "When Ephraim spake, instituting that horrible worship of the calves, he himself bore the sin of that horrible dictum, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was guilty of, and bore its punishment." This explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5d0;</span> is farfetched and unnatural. We have no hesitation in preferring "lifted up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his head, or exalted himself, for, though it is usually the Hithp. that is employed in this sense, examples also occur in which Qal is so used, for example <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a> and <a href="../../par/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>. Kimchi supplies <span class="accented">rosho</span>. We adhere, therefore, to the rendering and exposition of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>. <span class="cmt_word">But when he offended in Baal, he died.</span> This was not merely the calf-worship which, for political reasons, Jeroboam instituted and his successors retained, but the worship of Baal for which, no doubt, the calf-worship had prepared the way, and which had been introduced by Ahab at the instigation of his Sidonian queen. And though the people were partially and temporarily reformed through the efforts of Elijah the prophet and by the royal authority of Jehu, son of Nimshi, the evil was not eradicated, but frequently broke out again. The exaltation of Ephraim was not so much his distinction among his brethren as the governmental predominance at which that tribe ever aimed. That elevation, however, was soon followed by religious declension, culminating in the idolatry of Baal, which soon sealed the doom of the northern kingdom, thenceforth given up to destruction. The sentence of death was pronounced, and the actual dying commenced with the introduction of idolatrous worship. Thus, correctly, Kimchi: "He lifted up his head in Israel. And after he offended in Baal he died, as if he said, he was beaten before his enemies, as if he were dead, the power of his hand had departed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, <i>and</i> idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now they sin more and more</span> (margin, <span class="accented">add to sin</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen.</span> This part of the verse declares their persistent adherence to idolatry. The note of time, "and now," marks the transition from the past period, when Baal-worship had been introduced by Ahab and subsequently overturned by Jehu, to the prophet's own day. Not content with the calves of Jeroboam and the worship of Baal, they added new superstitions and new hideous objects of worship. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, a molten image, like the molten calf of Aaron, is singular, but used collectively, so as to correspond with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, idols, which is plural. The reference here is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> not to the calves or to Baal, but to various other idols which they had adopted, as at Gilgal and Beersheba (<a href="../../par/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> not content with the calves, they introduced gods of their own as their penates. The <span class="accented">material</span> out of which these molten images were manufactured was silver. Kimchi, however, gives a curious explanation in proof that the material was gold: "The calves," he says, "were not silver, but he means to say that, of the silver which they each one gave to procure gold to make the calves, they made for themselves idols according to their understanding; and these were the calves." The <span class="accented">manner</span> in which they made these idols was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">in their understanding</span>, that is, in their understanding, such as it was, so stupidly employed in such sensuous work, or their proficiency in the art of graving. Kimchi explains it somewhat differently: "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> is, 'As if they had carefully reflected on the matter what form they should give it, and then had agreed to make a calf, as they did in the wilderness.'" The reading of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> is disputed, but without sufficient ground. No doubt the Septuagint, which is followed by the Chaldee, Arabic, and Jerome, probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, to build, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, figure, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; for they translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">according to the likeness</span> or fashion of idols; while some manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi present <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">according to their understanding</span>, their own peculiar notions or fancy, and not as Moses, who made everything after the pattern showed him in the mount. The full form would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, but the feminine form is shortened before the suffix, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<a href="../../par/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>); and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/7-8.htm">Proverbs 7:8</a>); <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>). Some suppose it from a masculine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, of the same meaning. The <span class="accented">defect</span> of this man-made god is expressed by its being all of it the work of the craftsmen, without any element of sense, spirit, or divinity in it. On which Kimchi has well observed: "The whole calf is the work of the hands of the craftsman; there is nothing spiritual in it; as he says, 'There is no breath at all in the midst of it' (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">They say of them, Let the men that sacrifice</span> (margin, <span class="accented">the sacrificers of men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>kiss the calves</span>. The best explanation of this difficult clause is, in our opinion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Keil. His translation, though slightly different from that of the Authorized Version, has the same general import; thus: "Of them (the '<span class="accented">atsabbim</span>, idols) they say, viz. 'the sacrificers from among men' equivalent to 'the men who sacrifice,' Let them worship calves. By the apposition <span class="accented">zobheche</span> '<span class="accented">adam</span>, and the fact that the object '<span class="accented">agalim is</span> placed first, so that it stands in immediate contrast to '<span class="accented">adam</span>, the absurdity of men kissing calves, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worshipping them with kisses (see at 1 Kings 19:18), is painted, as it were, before the eyes." As parallel <span class="accented">to zobheche</span> '<span class="accented">adam</span>, comp. <span class="accented">evyone</span> '<span class="accented">adam</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>). Several eminent modern commentators give the same or a similar explanation, with the exception that, instead of translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "of them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the idols, as Keil does. They translate it "to them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the idol-worshippers. Kimchi in the main favors this explanation; he says, "On their account (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. on account of the calves) the priests of the calf say to the people who come to offer sacrifice: by the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> he means: whoever of the children of men that wish to offer, 'Let them kiss the calves on their mouth; for their worship shall not be perfect until they shall kiss them,' for so was their custom." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> many of the older interpreters among the Hebrews, as also Jerome, Cyril, and Theodoret among Christians, refer the expression to human sacrifices, thus: "Sacrificing men, they kiss, that is, adore, calves." The explanation according to this view, as given by Schmid, is to the following purport: "To <span class="accented">these</span> who now worship many idols, and among them Moloch, to whom they even sacrifice men, <span class="accented">those</span> the fathers of such as only worshipped the calves or Baal, would say, if they were alive, 'Let those who sacrifice men give over such cruel sacrifice, and rather kiss calves as we did.'" Rashi's comment is: "The idol priests say to Israel, 'He that sacrifices his son to idols is worthy to kiss the calf, for he has presented to him a pleasant gift.' So have our rabbins in (the tract) Sanhedrin explained, and it suits the text of Scripture bettor than the translation of Jonathan;" while that of Aben Ezra is as follows: "<span class="accented">To</span> them say the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men, in order to mock them [<span class="accented">kiss</span> the calves], because they kiss Baalim which are the images of calves, as 'And every month that has not kissed trim' (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>), while they shed innocent blood, and this is, ' And his blood shall he leave upon him' (Hosea 12:15). And lo! he has reversed the manner of' every man, for man kisses man who is his fellow, and slays calves for his <span class="accented">food</span>." The method of kissing the hand in worship is attested by the derivation of the word <span class="accented">adore</span>, from <span class="accented">ad</span> and <span class="accented">os</span>; while in <a href="../../par/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a> we read of homage thus rendered: "<span class="accented">Or</span> my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge." The Septuagint, (3, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="accented">zobheche</span>,' and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e7;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, translate by, "They say, 'Sacrifice (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) men, for the calves have come to an end' [or, 'failed,' <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>]." "Thus," says Jerome, in explanation, "is shown the greed of demons, who are nourished on the blood of victims, that, when victims raft, they desire men to be sacrificed to them."

Their irrational and God-dishonoring conduct was bringing on them sure and swift destruction. The prophet employs four figures to exhibit their political extinction. Two of these, the morning cloud and early dew, or rather the dew early passing away, have already been employed by him to characterize the transient nature of Israel's goodness; here they denote the evanescent nature of their national existence. The other two are the chaff and the smoke; the former whirled away by the storm-wind from the threshing-floor, the latter dissipated and speedily vanishing as soon as it escapes from the chimney or lattice. Such shall be the utter extermination of Israel. The senselessness of their idolatry had been treated with derision in the preceding verse; the punishment of their sin is sternly denounced in this. Kimchi comments concisely and correctly thus: "Therefore they shall go to destruction, and shall be as the morning cloud, or as the dew speedily disappearing in the morning, width vanishes when the heat of the sun has touched it; so they shall go away speedily. So also shall they be as chaff - it is the fine particles of straw, which the wind whirls away from the threshing-floor; thus shall they be whirled away from their land. Or as a pillar of smoke which goes forth out of the lattice, which shall speedily disperse and cease."

So Kimchi: "Thou shouldest not know other gods, nor serve them beside me, for ye see there is no helper Beside me." Likewise Rashi: "Thou shouldest not rebel against me." Also Aben Ezra: "How hast thou turned to kiss the calf, which does not save nor satisfy, and hast left him who has been thy God from ancient days, who has helped thee and knows all thy necessities." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, which, as the cognate Arabic signifies, "to go forth or away") is synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I did know thee in the wilderness.</span> The pronoun at the beginning of the verse is emphatic: <span class="accented">As for me</span>; or, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">it was that knew thee</span>. The meaning of the sentiment is: I acknowledged thee with kindness, with paternal care and kind providence watching over thee. "Thou shouldest gratefully acknowledge me," is the comment of Kimchi, "because I knew thee in the wilderness, and cared for thy necessity in the wilderness, in which there were no means of livelihood." <span class="cmt_word">In the land of great drought.</span> The root of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span>, unused in Hebrew, but signifying, in Arabic, "to burn, dry, be dry," akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>. Aben Ezra correctly explains it to be "a dry and thirsty laud, and so in the Arabic language; and (that it is so called) on account of all hardships being in it, is the allegorical explanation and not the literal sense." Instead of a lengthened enumeration of all God's loving-kindnesses to Israel at the Exodus and during the desert wanderings, the prophet sums up all in the expressive, "the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt;" and "I it was that did know thee in the wilderness." It is as though he had said, "I pitied thee in the bondage and among the brick-kilns of Egypt; I brought thee forth with a strong hand and outstretched arm; I led thee through the wilderness; I relieved thee in thy straits; I gave thee bread from heaven to satisfy thy hunger, and water from the rock to quench thy thirst; I defended thee from enemies; nor did I relax my care till I gave thee the goodly laud of promise." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to their pasture so were they filled.</span> The literal rendering is, <span class="accented">according to their pasturing so were they filled</span>. The reference is rather to the care in pasturing than to the pasture-ground. By God's care to the sheep of his pasture they waxed full. <span class="cmt_word">They were filled, and their heart was exalted.</span> Two consequences followed from God's great goodness to Israel - the immediate consequence was pride of heart; the more remote was forgetfulness of God. Perhaps these results should rather be regarded as concurrent, being in point of time simultaneous or nearly so. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore have they forgotten me.</span> This forgetfulness of God is identified with the abandonment of his worship in the Chaldee Version, which is, "They have abandoned my service." The metaphor contained in this verse is taken from a domestic animal, which, in a too luxuriant pasture, becomes headstrong and unmanageable. Thus Rash: "As soon as they came into the land of their pasture, they were filled." The last clause of the verse notices the misuse which Israel made of the riches and blessing of Jehovah, by forgetting their gracious Benefactor; this the prophet attributes to the abuse of the blessings so richly bestowed upon them. Aben Ezra identifies the blessings here mentioned with those vouchsafed to them on their entrance into Canaan; thus: "The prophet enumerates the benefits which Jehovah bestowed on their fathers when they came out of the wilderness into the land of Canaan." Kimchi quotes, as a parallel to this passage, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8.htm">Deuteronomy 8</a>, of which it is undoubtedly a reminiscence; he says, "When they entered into the place of their pasture, and it was the land of Canaan, they had all good, and were filled; and their heart was exalted, and they forgot me, as it is said in the Thorah that they were ready to do so. He said, 'Lest when thou hast eaten and art full... then thine heart be lifted up, and then forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt... who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness... who fed thee in the wilderness.'" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe <i>them</i>:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - These verses teach that the result of their sins is inevitable destruction, and that Jehovah, merciful and gracious though he is, has now divested himself of all compassion on them. The appropriateness of the terrible figures here employed arises from the fact that Israel had been compared in the previous verse to a flock fed and filled in a luxuriant pasture; the punishment of that flock is now fitly compared to "the tearing in pieces and devouring of that fattened flock by wild beasts." The beasts in question are a lion, a leopard, a bear, a lioness, and fierce wild beasts in general. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I will be unto them as a lion.</span> The verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is the future changed into the preterit or past tense by <span class="accented">vav</span> consecutive, and marks the consequence of forgetting God. So Aben Ezra: "The preterit in reference to the evils which Jehovah brought upon them." While the past thus implies that the punishment has commenced, the futures which follow denote its continuance. Rosenm&uuml;ller regards the preterit here as prophetic and continuative, and paraphrases the meaning by, "I have at length become and have been, and shall continue to be to them." He considers the reference of the preterit to be to past disasters, especially the various defeats sustained by Israel at the hand of the Syrians (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>) and the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). He also very aptly compares <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7-10</a> in relation to the subject in hand. The Prophet Isaiah, after relating the loving-kindnesses of the Lord and his praises and his great goodness to the house of Israel on the one hand, and their rebellion and vexing his Holy Spirit on the other hand, adds, "Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them." <span class="cmt_word">As a leopard by the way will I observe them.</span> The lion and the leopard are frequently conjoined, as animals of like natural ferocity, by the ancients both in sacred and secular writings. The outlook on the way is for the purpose of springing upon the passers-by. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> is properly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to look around, and thence, to lie in wait; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some, taking the initial <span class="accented">aleph</span> as radical and the word as participle of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, translate it by "<span class="accented">trodden</span> way," that is, away trodden and frequented by men and animals. The LXX. and Vulgate again, also Jerome, Hitzig, and Ewald, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> translate it by" <span class="accented">on the way</span> of the Assyrians," either referring to the time when they would be led captive by the Assyrians or when they persisted in going thither to sue for aid. But the name of Assyria is always written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, as Rashi rightly observes: "In every place where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;</span> occurs in Scripture (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as a proper name) it has daghesh (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in the <span class="accented">shin</span>); yet here it has raphe, [to show] that it is not the name of a place, but a verb: 'I observe and keep watch,' as 'I shall observe him, but not nigh' (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>)." Kimchi explains the verse as follows: "Because they have forgotten me, I also have rejected them, and have left them in the hand of the peoples; and have become to them like a lion or leopard, which observes the way, and is prepared to tear whatever passes by it on the way. Just so have I been to them, for I have caused their enemies to rule over them, and they have not had power to deliver themselves from their hand until they returned to me, and I took pity upon them."

Of all animals, Jerome says, the she-bear is the fiercest, either when robbed of her whelps or in want of food. <span class="accented">Seghor</span> being that which encloses the heart, is either the pericardium, the immediate and proper enclosure of the heart, or the breast itself. The reference is to a beast of prey which seizes its victim by the breast and tears it open, so that the heart is exposed. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e9;</span> is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e2;</span>, the meaning of the root-syllable <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;</span>, to meet, strike, being the same in both. Such is the continuation of the picture of the threatened punishment. The picture of the severity of the Divine judgment here presented is very terrible. Kimchi remarks on this picture: "A bear robbed, whose young ones they have slain, which is bereft and bitter in spirit, if it find man or beast rends it speedily." Some understand the verse figuratively, as though it meant "'I will rend their obstinate heart,' the enclosure of the heart being equivalent to a shut or obstinate heart, as, in ver. 5 of this same chapter, 'a land of drought' is pretty much the same as 'a dry or parched land.' Thus the Chaldee translates, 'I have broken the wickedness of their heart.'" <span class="cmt_word">And there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</span> <span class="accented">Sham</span> there refers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to '<span class="accented">al-derekh</span> of the preceding verse; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as Kimchi explains it, as referring to their cities: "There in their cities shall I destroy them by pestilence and by the sword of the enemy, like the lion that teareth without pity;" or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> more simply still, "there on the spot."

While some were to be destroyed by famine and pestilence, others would perish by the wild beast of the field. "Also," says Kimchi, "shall the wild beast of the field rend them outside (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. outside their cities), as, ' I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number.'"

The explanation of Rashi, who understands <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the verb as second person preterit Piel with suffix, is: "'Because thou hast acted unfaithfully against me, thou hast rebelled against thy help.' The Scripture uses brevity, but he who understands the language of Scripture will recall to mind that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is 'because against me is the rebellion with which thou hast rebelled. And if thou shouldst say, What does it concern thee? Against thy help hast thou rebelled when thou didst rebel against me.'" Kimchi remarks in the two <span class="accented">beths</span> servile that one of them would suffice, and that the sense might have been expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span> . All the disaster and destruction previously mentioned are charged on Israel's misconduct; they had brought all upon themselves by their rebellion against Jehovah who would otherwise have been their Shield and Deliverer. The sense is well expressed by Calvin thus: "How comes it, and what is the reason, that I do not now help thee according to my usual manner? Thou hast indeed found me hitherto to be thy Deliverer.... How comes it now that I have cast thee away, that thou criest in vain, and that no one brings thee any help? How comes it that thou art thus forsaken, and receivest no relief whatever from my hand, as thou hast been wont to do? And doubtless I should never be wanting to thee, if thou wouldest allow me; but thou closest the door against me, and by thy wickedness spurnest my favor, so that it cannot come to thee. It then follows, that thou art now destroyed through thine own fault: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Something</span> then hath destroyed thee." It will be observed that the rebellion against Jehovah here complained of is not that of all Israel, when they are said to have rejected Jehovah by asking a king of Samuel; but the defection of the ten tribes that cast off their allegiance to the house of David and made Jeroboam their king.

When the kings and princes whom they had sinfully sought, and who had been given to them in anger would fail, God himself would be their King, as is stated in vers. 10 and 11. Further, when in consequence of their iniquities treasured up, their sorrows and sufferings would be extreme, as stated in vers. 12 and 13, yet they would be raised up as out of their graves, as promised in ver. 14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Israel had shown contempt for Jehovah by putting confidence in kings of their own choice, yet these kings could not afford them help, whence the questions of ver. 10.

The purpose for which the Israelites had asked a king was that he might "judge them and go out before them to fight their battles" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>). The question, then, does not indicate the want of a king, or the prevalence of a state of anarchy, but that a crisis had come when such a king as they had requested should exhibit his prowess and display his power. It is as though the prophet asked, or rather God by his servant," Where is now the king that can defend the besieged cities, or deliver the attacked fortresses; and defeat the Assyrian foeman who is now threatening both? Or where are the judges (<span class="accented">shophetim</span>), or the princes (<span class="accented">sarim</span>), who constitute his cabinet or royal counselors sharing in the counsels of state, and administering the affairs of the kingdom under him?" The answer implied is that those visible helps, on which Israel had so confidently calculated, turned out valueless; the kingly constitution on which they had set their heart proved a failure, as far as help and deliverance were concerned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span> as first person future of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>; thus: "I shall be established for ever, but where is thy king? Whereas thou didst reject my kingdom, and demanded a king who should save you; and it should be he that would save you in all your cities against which the enemies came."

The day of reckoning would certainly come, for the sin of Ephraim was neither forgotten nor blotted out. As a miser puts his money in a bag and seals it to prevent it being lost, so the Almighty had, as it were, hoarded Ephraim's sin, putting it in a bag and tying it. A parallel expression occurs in <a href="../../par/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>," My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity." Usually when men put money into a bag, purse, or treasure-house, they count it; so the sins of Ephraim were reckoned, laid up in the treasury of wrath, till the amount should be full and the day of reckoning arrive. The sinner himself is represented as treasuring up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath. Aben Ezra only remarks on the place where it is treasured: "It is bound up in my heart; I shall not forget it as they have forgotten me, as is written above" (ver. 6, "They have forgotten me").

Also Wunsche: "He is an unwise son, for at the time he stands not in the breaking forth of children." It might be expressed, as in the Authorized Version, with a slight modification; thus: For otherwise <span class="accented">he would not stand long time in the place of the breaking forth of children</span>. The figure is now shifted from the mother to the child; such abrupt and sudden transitions are not infrequent in Scripture, especially in the Pauline Epistles (setup. e.g. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>). The danger is represented as extreme, as may be inferred from the similar expression, "The children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth." A perilous period in Israel's history is indicated, and to escape the danger he must make no tarrying, but advance at once into the new life of faith and repentance. Kimchi has the following comment: "Because he has compared his pains to the pain of a woman in travail, he says, 'The children are not wise,' as if he said, 'The coming generations, who have seen their fathers in affliction because of their iniquities, are not wise, and do not consider that distress has overtaken their fathers because of their iniquity; and turn not from the evil deeds of their fathers, but have done wickedness like them.'" He adds: "There are children lively by nature in their coming forth out of the womb; so also would these, if they were wise, not stay a single hour in distress, but immediately On returning to the Lord be delivered out of their distress." The LXX. omit the negative and render <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1fc7;</span>: "This wise son of thine [employed ironically] shall not stand [or, 'endure'] in the destruction of his children or people."

A third <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> derivation is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, to hang down loose or slack, then to be deep, or low, and so the noun comes to signify sinking, depth, abyss. <span class="cmt_word">O Death, I will be thy plagues; O Grave, I will be thy destruction</span>. Thus <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> incorrectly taken by some for the first person future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>; it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> more properly taken in the sense of "where," as in ver. 10 of the present chapter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> is plural, referred by some to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, hence <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x1fc6;</span>, LXX.; it is,  however, the plural of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, pestilence, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, pestilence, destruction, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span>, to cut off, akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d1;</span>. Hitzig says that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> are originally infinitives, and the last two designate instruments or members, and thus give a sort of support to the traditional <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the LXX. Now, this verse has been understood by some in the sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of consolation; and by others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in that of combination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the latter sense it is understood by the Hebrew commentators, and by not a few Christian interpreters. Thus Rashi: "I am he who redeemed them from the hand of Sheol, and delivered them from death; but now I will set myself to speak against thee words of death." Aben Ezra: "I redeemed thy fathers; now I shall be thy deadly pestilence; I will also be thy destruction." Kimehi is more diffuse, as usual; he explains thus: "I would have redeemed them from the power of Sheol, if they had been wise. But now that he is not wise, but a feel, and denies my goodness, it is not enough that I shall not redeem thee from death, but I shall bring upon thee death by pestilence, and by the sword, and by famine, and by evil beast." The condition supplied by Kimchi is entirely arbitrary and without anything in the context to suggest it. Calvin in like manner interjects a <span class="accented">condition</span>; thus: "I will redeem them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death; that is, except they resist, I will become willingly their Redeemer. Some have, therefore, rendered the passage in the subjunctive mood, 'From the hand of the grave I would redeem them, from death I would deliver them.... I will then redeem them, as far as this depends on me;' for a condition is to be introduced, as though God came forth and declared that he was present to fulfill the office of a Redeemer. What, then, does stand in the way? Even the hardness of the people. He afterwards adds, 'I will be thy perdition, O Death; I will be thy excision, O Grave.' By these words the prophet more distinctly sets forth the power of God, and magnificently extols it, lest men should think that there is no way open to him to save, when no hope according to the judgment of the flesh appears. Hence the prophet says, 'Though men are now dead, there is yet nothing to prevent God to quicken them. How so? For he is the ruin of death, and the excision of the grave;' that is, 'Though death should swallow up all men, though the grave should consume them, yet God is superior to both death and the grave, for he can slay death, for he can abolish the grave.' He afterwards proceeds to "answer to that which is said of Paul quoting this passage. The solution is not difficult. The apostles do not avowedly at all times adduce passages which in their whole context apply to the subject they handle; but sometimes they allude to a word only, sometimes they apply a passage to a subject in the way of resemblance, and sometimes they bring forward passages as testimonies. When the apostles use the testimonies of Scripture, then the genuine and real truth must be sought out; but when they glance only at one word, there is no occasion to make any anxious inquiry; and when they quote any passage of Scripture in the way of resemblance, it is a too scrupulous anxiety to seek out how all the parts agree. But it is quite evident that Paul, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, has not quoted the testimony of the prophet for the purpose of confirming the doctrine el which he speaks. What then? As the resurrection of the flesh was a truth very difficult to be believed, nay, wholly contrary to the judgment of nature, Paul says that it is no matter of wonder...because it is the peculiar prerogative of God to be the perdition of death and the destruction of the grave.... He is endued with that incomprehensible power by which he can raise us from a state of putrefaction; nay, since he created the world from nothing, he will also raise us up from the grave, for he is the death of death, the grave of the grave, the ruin of ruin, and the destruction of destruction; and the simple object of Paul is to extol by these striking words that incredible power of God, which is beyond the reach of human understanding." Others viewing the subject in the same light, read the clauses <span class="accented">interrogatively</span>, and the imperfects in a subjunctive sense; thus - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"From the power of Sheol should I ransom them?<br />From death deliver them?'</span> The answer being, "Certainly not." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Where are thy pestilences. O Death?<br />Where is thy destruction, O Sheol? <br />Let those pestilences and that destruction<br />be produced for Ephraim's ruin."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Repentance</span> (<span class="accented">relenting</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall be hid from mine eyes.</span> This Rashi explains: "I will feel no regret over this calamity." But we greatly prefer the sense of consolation assigned by many Christian interpreters to the passage. No doubt the verse before and that following this fourteenth verse are a threat which probably induced so many, as we have seen, to include this verse in the menace. But the abruptness of the prophet's style sufficiently accounts for a bright Messianic promise to relieve the gloom of the dark predictions among which it is interjected. Redemption from the power of Sheol  signifies, not merely deliverance from danger and deliverance from death, but deliverance from the under world by rescuing the living from the region of the dead, or rescuing from the realm of death those already subject to his grim dominion; while the destruction of death is celebrated in words of triumph, as Theodoret says, "He gives command to sing a paean over [literally, 'against'] death." To the Israelites the promise signified the power of the Lord to redeem from death and restore them from destruction to newness of life, just as the dead dry bones of Israel in the valley of Ezekiel's vision are restored to life. The use which Paul makes of this verse when he couples it with the words of Isaiah, "Death is swallowed up in victory," in <a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>, is to confirm the full and final annihilation of death at the resurrection. This fuller and deeper meaning, dimly unfolded to Old Testament saints, was clearly brought to light in New Testament Scripture. The absence of repentance denotes the irrevocable accomplishment of the Divine purpose of salvation. Pussy has pertinently remarked upon this verse: "God by his prophets mingles promises of mercy in the midst of his threats of punishment. His mercy overflows the bounds of the occasion upon which he makes it known. He had sentenced Ephraim to temporal destruction. This was unchangeable. He points to that which turns all temporal loss into gain, that eternal redemption. The words are the fullest which could have been chosen. The word rendered 'ransom' signifies rescued them by the payment of a price; the word rendered 'redeem' relates to one who, as the nearest of kin, had the right to acquire anything as his own by paying that price. Both words, in their exactest sense, describe what Jesus did, buying us with a price... and becoming our near kinsman by his incarnation.... The words refuse to be tied down to a temporal deliverance. A little longer continuance in Canaan is not a redemption from the power of the grave; nor was Ephraim so delivered."

The name Ephraim, signifying "double-fruitfulness," shall be verified, confirming the promised redemption from death, and, by the pledge of blessing, which the name implies affording a guarantee that the coming storm would not quite overwhelm them. The play on the name Ephraim fixes the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, the <span class="accented">aleph</span> taking the place of <span class="accented">he</span>. The Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, equivalent to "shall cause a division," and Jerome's <span class="accented">divider</span>, suppose <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>. But though fruitful among the other tribes, yet the abuse of that fruitfulness invited the instrument of destruction. There is an allusion to the patriarchal blessing, "Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well;" the source of his fruitfulness was that well or fountain; while the drying up of it would be the certain cause of barrenness. <span class="cmt_word">An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness.</span> Thus, while Ephraim presents the pleasing picture of a fair and fruitful tree, the element of destruction is already on the way. A wind, the east wind, with its rude vehemence, blighting heat, and desolating effect, was coming. It was a wind, not coming by chance, but commissioned by Jehovah as a minister of vengeance to execute his wrath. It was, moreover, a wind issuing forth from its home in the desert, and fraught with fiery heat from the scorching sands of the Arabian desert. <span class="cmt_word">And his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.</span> This flourishing tree, planted by the living spring, to which it owed its vigor and verdure, was doomed soon to wither in consequence of the drying up of the waters, that nourished it, by the east wind. <span class="cmt_word">He shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</span> Here the figure merges in the fact. The Assyrian conqueror was the blustering east wind, that swept like a whirlwind with his armies from the east. He not only ravaged the country, but rifled the treasures of the capital The <span class="accented">keli chemdah</span> included all the valuables and treasures of Samaria referred to in the following verse. Kimchi explains the verse as follows: "For Ephraim was fruitful among brethren as long as he did not make calves. He became increasingly great and fruitful among his brethren, as Jacob said of him.... And now that he has sinned, an east wind of the Lord shall come; and it is the King of Assyria that is meant. And he compares him to the east wind, because it is a wind from the east, for the land of Assyria lies to the east of the land of Israel; and further he says, 'east wind,' because it is a violent wind. And he says, 'wind of Jehovah,' to magnify the wind and emphasize it; and he says also, 'spirit of Jehovah,' because Jehovah the blessed stirred up his spirit (i.e. spirit of the King of Assyria) to come against Israel, 'goeth up from the wilderness;' wind is always in the wilderness. Or the explanation is, because the wilderness is between the land of Israel and the land of Assyria; and before this wind, which is the King of Assyria, is dried up the fountain of Ephraim, which was at first like a tree flourishing by the waters." And now before this wind shall its spring become dry and its fountain dried up. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, is an irregular formation for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as on the contrary we find the Hiph. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as if from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>.

In the latter sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span>, to atone or suffer the punishment of contracted guilt; in the former sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span>, and it is translated accordingly by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;</span> in the LXX., and <span class="accented">pereat</span> by Jerome; so also Aben Ezra: "It shall be laid waste;" Kimchi: "The <span class="accented">aleph</span> has <span class="accented">seh'wa</span> alone, and the signification 'desolation,' and so the dwellers therein shall be made desolate." He thus intimates that <span class="accented">aleph</span>, having <span class="accented">sch'aa</span> alone without seghol, does not belong to the root, which is not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> (for its future would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dd;</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Rashi, however, understands it in the sense of "atone," or "find out her guiltiness;" he says, "From now will her guilt manifest itself." The reason of Samaria being thus mentioned is not only that it was the capital of the northern kingdom, but, as Kimchi says, "it confirmed Israel in the worship of the calves; for if the kings had been good, they would have brought back Israel to what was good." The <span class="accented">ki</span> assigns the reason of Samaria's desolation or guilt; it was rebellion against Jehovah, for Samaria was the seat and center of idolatry, and hence it spread throughout the land. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</span> The destruction thus described was to be complete. The present population would perish by the sword; the future progeny would be extinguished and all posterity cut off. Not only the children already born, but those unborn, were devoted to destruction; and all this in the most savage and barbarous manner. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, to meddle, gratify one's self, indulge one's caprice) presents childhood on the side of playfulness or petulance. The pronominal suffix attached to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> refers to the city; and the feminine noun itself, forming subject to verbs in the masculine, arises from the fact that the feminine of the imperfect plural becomes rarer; or because the feminine plural only gradually distinguishes itself by a peculiar form from the masculine. The cruelties here specified may have been occasioned by those of the same kind with which Menahem King of Samaria smote Tiphsah. On that occasion "all the women therein that were with child he ripped up" (compare, for the cruel practice, 'Iliad,' 6:58; ,<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a> and 2 Kings 15:16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hosea/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hosea 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hosea/14.htm"><title>Hosea 14 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hosea/14.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hosea/14.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hosea/14-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hosea/13.htm" title="Hosea 13">&#9668;</a> Hosea 14 <a href="../joel/1.htm" title="Joel 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a></div><div class="verse">O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The foregoing part of this book abounds with denunciations of punishment; this closing chapter superabounds with promises of pardon. Wave after wave of threatened wrath had rolled over Israel and come in unto their soul; now offer after offer of grace is made to them. O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God. The invitation to return implies previous departure, or distance, or wandering from God. The return to which they are invited is expressed, not by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, to or towards, but by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;</span>, quite up to, or as far as right home; the penitent, therefore, is not merely to turn his mind or his face toward God, but to turn his face and his feet home to God; he is not to go half the way and then turn aside, or part of the way and then turn back, but the whole way; in other words, his repentance is to be complete and entire, wanting nothing, according to the state merit of the psalmist, "It is good for me to draw near to God." As punishment was threatened in case of obstinate impenitence, so mercy is promised on condition of thorough repentance. <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</span> A reason is here assigned for the preceding invitation; <span class="accented">ka-shalta</span> is properly "thou hast stumbled," "made a false step," fallen, yet so that recovery was among future possibilities. The same thought may be included in the fact that Jehovah continues to call his erring people by the honored and honorable name of Israel, and to acknowledge himself their God. Further, many and grievous were the calamities into which by their fall they had been precipitated; neither were any to blame but themselves - their iniquity or their folly was the cause, nor was there any one to lift them up, now that they lay prostrate, save Jehovah. After referring to the desolation of Samaria and the ruthless destruction of its inhabitants, as portrayed in the last verse of the previous chapter, Jerome adds, "All Israel is invited to repentance, that he who has been debilitated, or has fallen headlong in his iniquities, may return to the physician and recover health, or that he who had fallen headlong may begin to stand." The penitent is to direct his thoughts to Jehovah; to him as Center he is attracted, and in him he finds his place of rest; nor is there ether means of recovery or source of help. Thus Kimchi says, "For thou seest that through thine iniquity thou hast fallen, therefore it behooves thee to return to Jehovah, as nothing besides can raise thee from thy fall but thy return to him." "There is none," says Aben Ezra, "can raise thee from thy fall but the Eternal alone."

There is an allusion, perhaps, to the requirement of the Law: "None shall appear before me empty." Not outward sacrifices, but words of confession, were the offering to be presented. Thus Cyril eloquently explains it: "Ye shall propitiate the Deity, not by making offerings of riches, not by dedicating gold, not by honoring him with silver vessels, not gladdening him by sacrifices of oxen, not by slaughtering of birds; but ye shall give him discourses and wish to praise the Lord of the universe, appeasing him." To the same purport is the exposition of Aben Ezra: "He desires not from you, when ye go to seek his favor, treasures or burnt offerings, only words with which ye are to confess;" so also Kimchi: "He does not require of you on your return to him silver or gold or offering, which the Israelites lavished at great expense on their idols, but good works with which ye are to confess your iniquities." <span class="cmt_word">Say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously.</span> On turning to the Lord with their whole heart, not with their lips only, they are furnished with a form of sound words which God by his prophet puts into their mouth. Elsewhere a formula is prescribed, thus: "Publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy people, the remnant of Israel" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>); compare also <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-35.htm">1 Chronicles 16:35</a>. The position of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> before the verb creates a difficulty and causes diversity of rendering; for example, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> besides the ordinary rendering, which takes <span class="accented">kol</span> as holding its peculiar position by an hypallage, there is a modification of it: "All take away of iniquity." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some supply <span class="accented">mem</span>, and translate accordingly: "From all take away iniquity." Kimchi explains it as a transposition: "All iniquity forgive," and compares <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>; or, understanding <span class="accented">le</span>, "Forgive to every one iniquity." The object of the separation may be for greater emphasis.  In like manner, the following clause is also subject to diversity of translation and interpretation. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering of the Authorized Version, which appears to supply <span class="accented">le</span> before <span class="accented">tov</span>: "Receive <span class="accented">us</span> for good," viz. <span class="accented">in bonam partem</span>, or graciously; or, "receive <span class="accented">our prayer</span> graciously." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Another rendering or exposition is: "Take what is good (of thine own to bestow it on us);" thus in the sixty-eighth psalm at the nineteenth verse God is said to receive gifts among men, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for distribution among men, and hence the apostle, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>, substitutes <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>, and thus expresses the sense. The literal sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is the correct sense, namely, "and receive good:" "And receive good," says Jerome, "for unless thou hadst borne away our evil things we could not possibly have any good thing to offer thee, according to that which is written, 'Cease from evil and do good.'" Thus also the words are translated and interpreted by Pusey: "When then Israel and, in him, the penitent soul, is taught to <span class="accented">say, receive good</span>, it can mean only the good which thou thyself hast given; as David says, ' Of thine own we have given thee;" while he adds in a note on these words, "No one would have doubted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d8;</span> means, 'receive good,' as just before, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> means 'take words,' but for the seeming difficulty - What good had they?" <span class="cmt_word">So will we</span> <span class="cmt_word">render the calves of our lips</span>. This is more accurately rendered, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "So will we render young bullocks, even our lips." The word <span class="accented">shillem, to</span> render, or repay, is almost technical in its application to thank offer-tugs or sacrifices in fulfillment of a vow; the best animals for thank offerings were parm, or young oxen; but the lips, that is, the utterances of the lips, consisting of prayers or praises, or both, are to take the place of the animal sacrifices offered in thanksgiving. Thus the psalmist says, "I will praise the Name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, renders by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> which the inspired author of Hebrews alludes, "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks [margin, 'confessing'] to his Name;" or perhaps the reference in Hebrews is to <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, "I create the fruit of the lips." Further, as words of confession in ver. 2 take the place of sacrifices of sin offerings, so here words of thanksgiving replace sacrifices of thanksgiving. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/14-3.htm">Hosea 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, <i>Ye are</i> our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Asshur shall not save us: we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</span> This was the practical side of Israel's repentance; this was bringing forth fruits meet for repentance. Here was a renunciation of all hope of safety from the world-powers - both Assyria and Egypt. They would never again have recourse to Assyria for help, nor to Egypt for horses; nor confide in their own unaided power or prowess; while this renunciation of worldly power and carnal confidences implied, as its opposite, unfaltering faith in the protecting power and saving strength of Jehovah. All thin was much, and yet more was required; next to such renunciation of merely human aid, as indicated, and its contrary, the recognition of Divine assistance, comes the absolute and complete abandonment of their national and besetting sin of idolatry. They have so far come to themselves and received the right use of reason as to confess that the manufacture of man's hands cannot be man's god, thus giving up with feelings of contempt and disgust the groveling sin of idolatry with its attendant vices. Still more, they are penetrated with the conviction that man without God is a poor fatherless creature, in no better, if not in a worse, condition than that of a weak orphan child. They have the consolation at the same time that for all such, on their return to him, the father of the fatherless and the God of the orphan has bowels of tenderest compassion. To the presumed prayer of the penitent an answer overflowing with mercy is promised at once, and by God himself in the next section, consisting of - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</span> The penitential prayer put in the mouth of the people receives in this verse a gracious response; words of contrite confession are echoed back in accents of compassion and consolation. When thus penitent and prayerful they returned to the Lord, he promises them favor as well as forgiveness, so as to heal the moral malady under which they had long labored, remedy the evil effects of their apostasy, and withhold the stripes he was going to inflict. <span class="accented">Meshubhatham</span> means <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> their turning away from God and all included therein - defection, rebellion, idolatry, and other sins. The disease would be healed, and its consequences averted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some, however, understand the word, in a good sense, to mean "conversion ' or "the converted," the abstract being put for the concrete; the blessing is thus promised them when they turned or returned to God. Thus the Syriac version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. again, connecting <span class="accented">meshubhah</span> with <span class="accented">yashav</span>, to sit or dwell, render it by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, that is," I will heal their dwelling." There is little doubt that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is the correct translation, and it is generally accepted as such. They are next assured of God's love, and that spontaneously (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> understood) with ready willinghood and unfeignedly. God's love is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> free, anticipating its objects, not waiting to be merited or purchased, without money and without price; it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> also purest and most sincere affection, altogether unlike that feigned affection sometimes found among men, who profess much love while their heart goeth after their covetousness, or after some other and different object from that pretended. Then follows an assurance that there is no barrier to the exercise and no obstacle to the outgoing of God's love; the turning away of God's anger from Israel is the ground of such assurance. Some copies read <span class="accented">mimmeni</span>, my anger is turned away from me, instead of <span class="accented">mimmena</span>; <span class="accented">this</span>, however, is erroneous, though the sense is not much affected by it. The error may have arisen from a misunderstanding of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-35.htm">Jeremiah 2:35</a>. Rashi explains the verse correctly: "After they have thus spoken before me: I will heal them of their apostasy, and love them of my own free will; although they themselves are not worthy of love, yet will I love them freely, for mine anger has turned away from them." Aben Ezra <span class="accented">says</span>. "Backsliding is in the soul what disease is in the body, therefore he uses the word 'heal.' But God proceeds to perform what he has promised; he does not confine his goodness to words, he exhibits it in works, as the following verses show." <span class="cmt_word">I will be as the dew unto Israel.</span> "The Jussive assumes different shades of meaning, varying with the situation or authority of the speaker.... Sometimes, from the circumstances of the case, the command becomes a permission: <a href="../../par/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>, 'I will be as the dew to Israel: <span class="accented">let</span> him flourish, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, <span class="accented">and strike forth</span> his roots as Lebanon'" (Driver). In lands where there is little rain, the dew, falling copiously, <span class="accented">fertilizes</span> the earth, refreshes the languid plants, revives the face of nature, and makes all things grow. Thus the dew becomes the source of fruitfulness. So God, by his Spirit's grace, is the Source of Israel's spiritual fruitfulness. <span class="cmt_word">He shall grow</span> (margin, <span class="accented">blossom</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>as the lily</span>. This comparison suggests many qualities, any one of which may characterize, or all of which may combine in, the spiritual growth thus pictured. There is the purity of the lily, the beauty of the lily, the fecundity of the lily, the perfume of the lily, the rapidity of its growth, the stately slightness of its stem. We may combine the <span class="accented">rapidity</span> of its growth; <span class="accented">its fecundity</span>, with regard to which Pliny informs us that a single root produces fifty bulbs; its <span class="accented">beauty</span>, to which our Lord refers in contrast with the glory of Solomon. But its root is weak, and he, on that account perhaps, subjoins: <span class="cmt_word">And cast forth</span> (margin, <span class="accented">strike</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his roots as Lebanon</span>. Whether it mean that the roots are as the trees of Lebanon or the mountain of Lebanon itself, the thought expressed by this comparison is <span class="accented">stability</span>. "As the trees of Lebanon," says Jerome, "which strike their roots as far down into the depths as they lift their heads up into the air, so that they can be shaken by no storm, but by their stable massiveness maintain their position." <span class="cmt_word">His branches shall spread;</span> margin, <span class="accented">go</span>; rather, <span class="accented">go on</span>. This feature in the representation denotes <span class="accented">enlargement</span> or <span class="accented">expansion</span>. The tender branches (suckers) spreading out in all directions very aptly set forth the multiplication of Israel or their growth and increase numerically. But branches straggling, crooked, and ill-shaped would rather be a blemish than a beauty. It is, therefore, added: <span class="cmt_word">His beauty shall be as the olive tree.</span> The olive has been called the crown of the fruit trees of Palestine, but besides, its fruitage so plentiful and useful, the splendor of its green, and the enduring freshness of its foliage, make it a vivid picture of that <span class="accented">beauty</span> of holiness or spiritual graces which it is here employed to represent. There is still an additional element of interest pertaining to this goodly tree, namely, <span class="cmt_word">And his smell as Lebanon</span>. This signifies the <span class="accented">fragrance</span> of this beautiful tree of righteousness. The smell of Lebanon is referred to in <a href="../../par/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>, "And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon." What with its cedars, and spices, and fruit, and flowers, and aromatic shrubs, and fragrant vines, Lebanon must perfume the air with the most delightful odors. Thus acceptable to God and pleasing to man shall Israel become. The commentators quote with commendation Rosenm&uuml;ller's explanation of the individual features of this inimitable picture: "The rooting indicates <span class="accented">stability</span>; the spreading of the branches, <span class="accented">propagation</span> and the multitude of inhabitants; the splendor of the olive, <span class="accented">beauty and glory</span>, and that constant and lasting; the fragrance, <span class="accented">hilarity</span> and loveliness." The simile changes into the metaphor; Israel, from being likened to a tree, becomes the tree. <span class="cmt_word">They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow</span> (margin, <span class="accented">blossom</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>as the vine: the scent</span> (rather, <span class="accented">renown</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</span> There is some difficulty and consequent diversity of rendering and explanation in connection with this verse. If the tree be Israel in its collective or national capacity, the dwellers under its shadow are the members of the nation, separate]y and severally, flourishing under the widespread branches of this umbrageous tree. The word <span class="accented">yashubhu</span> is explained: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> return, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. betake themselves to his shadow, which is incongruous, for how could they be said to return to their own shadow or dwell securely under it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> return to their native land, so the Chaldee, - this is somewhat better; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> return to the worship of Jehovah, said of Israelites who had abandoned it, not properly of Gentiles turning to that worship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, comparing <a href="../../par/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-12.htm">1 Samuel 30:12</a>, explains it in the sense of coming to themselves, reviving. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Keil constructs <span class="accented">yashubhu</span> adverbially by a common idiom with <span class="accented">yechayyu</span>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> translates "shalt give life to come again," that is, "Those who sit beneath the shade of Israel, the tree that is bursting into leaf, will revive corn, cause it to return to life, or produce it for nourishment, satiety, and strengthening." Similarly the Vulgate, "sustain life by corn." This, however, must appear tame after the splendid promises that went before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Vivify; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. produce seed like corn, and rejoice in a numerous offspring as from a seed of corn many proceed; according to this, "seed" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) must be supplied, and <span class="accented">caph</span> of comparison. The added clause agrees with this, for the flourishing of the vine also symbolizes prolific persons (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>). Further, the vine does not always flourish, yet, not like the corn which after harvest ceases and is no more seen, its root remains, and next year grows green and yields its fruit anew. The fame of the wine of Lebanon is celebrated for its taste and fragrance. Kimchi cites Asaph, a physician, as writing that the wine of Lebanon, of Hermon, of Carmel, of the mountains of Israel and Jerusalem and Caphior, surpass all others in flavor, taste, and for medicinal purposes.

The designation "minor" does not imply any inferiority in importance of subject or value of contents, but has respect solely to the smallness of their size as compared with the larger discourses of the others. The twelve minor prophets were added to the canon before its completion as a single book, "lest," says Kimchi, in his commentary on this verse, "a book of them should be lost because of its smallness, if each one of them should be kept separate by itself."

It is radically the same name as Joshua, except that the prefix of the latter implies the name of Jehovah as the Author of such deliverance or salvation; while the Greek form of <span class="accented">Joshua</span> is <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, which in two passages of the Authorized Version stands for it. The form of the name in the original is closely connected with Hosanna (<span class="accented">hoshia</span> ha)," save now," which occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span> The period of Hosea's prophetic activity is one of the longest, if not the longest, on record. It continued during the reigns of the four kings of Judah above mentioned, and during that of Jeroboam II. King of Israel, which was in part coincident with that of Uzziah. Uzziah and Jeroboam reigned contemporaneously for twenty-six years. Somewhere during or rather before the end of that period Hosea commenced his ministry. Uzziah survived Jeroboam some twenty-six years, then Jotham and Ahaz in succession reigned each sixteen years. During all these fifty-eight years Hosea continued his ministerial labors. To these must be added a few years for the beginning of his prophetic career during the reign of Jeroboam, and some two or three years before its close in the reign of Hezekiah; for the destruction of Samaria, which took place in the fourth year of that king, the prophet looks forward to as still future. Thus for three score years and more - probably nearer three score years and ten, the ordinary period of human life - the prophet persevered in the discharge of his onerous duties. It may seem strange that, though Hosea exercised his prophetic function in Israel, yet the time during which he did so is reckoned by the reigns of the kings of Judah. The single exception of Jeroboam II. is accounted for in a rabbinic tradition on the ground that he did not credit or act on the evil report which Amaziah the priest of Bethel preferred against the Prophet Amos, as we read (<a href="../../par/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>), "Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam King of Israel, saying, <span class="accented">Amos</span> hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words" (see also vers. 11-13 of the same chapter). The real reason for the reckoning by the kings of Judah, and for the exceptional case of Jeroboam, was not that assigned by the rabbins; neither was it an indication, on the part of the prophet, of the legitimacy of the kingdom of Judah on the one hand, and evidence, on the other hand, of the performance of God's promise to Jehu that his sons would sit upon the throne to the fourth generation, while Jeroboam, Jehu's great-grandson, was the last king of that dynasty by whom God vouch-sated help to Israel, his son and successor Zechariah retaining possession of the kingdom only for the short space of six months. The true cause is rather to be sought in the regicides, usurpations, occasional anarchy, and generally unsettled state of the northern kingdom, inasmuch as such instability and uncertainty furnished no sure or satisfactory basis for chronological calculation. Thus we find that, on the death of Jeroboam II., there was an interregnum of some dozen years, during which, of course, a state of anarchy prevailed. At length Zechariah succeeded to the throne; he had reigned only six months when he was murdered by Shallum. Shallum's reign only lasted a month, when he was put to death by Menahem. During his reign often years occurred the invasion of Pal. Menahem's son, Pekachiah, had only reigned two years when he was murdered by Pekah, in whose reign Tiglath-pileser invaded the land. Hoshea slew Pekah. Next followed an interval of anarchy lasting eight years. Then, after Hoshea's short reign of nine years, the kingdom was destroyed. Thus it was only in the southern kingdom that a sufficiently firm foundation for chronological reckoning was available, while under these circumstances Jeroboam's reign was necessary to show the prophet's connection with Israel, and also that the prediction of the fourth verse preceded the event foretold. The general heading of the whole book is contained in this verse and Divine authority is thus claimed for the whole, as the prophet to whom the word of the Lord came is only Jehovah's spokesman.

Thus Gesenius translates, understanding ashen, which is often omitted as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative, indicating relation, and as including the antecedent personal or demonstrative pronoun. When the pronoun thus supplied is in the genitive, the preceding noun is in the construct state, as here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, without necessity, takes the noun in the adverbial sense; thus: "In the beginning Jehovah spake by Hosea." He also suggests the possibility of <span class="accented">dibber</span> being a noun of the same meaning as <span class="accented">dabar</span>, but of different formation; while in two manuscripts of De Rossi and one of Kennicott the regular form of the construct state of <span class="accented">davar</span> is expressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil takes the noun as an accusative of time, and accounts for its construct state by the substantival idea of the succeeding subordinated clause; thus: "<span class="accented">At</span> the commencement of ' Jehovah spake,' Jehovah said to him." But what is the beginning here mentioned? It cannot mean that Hoses was the first of the prophets by whom God made known his will to Israel, or the first of the minor prophets; for Jonah, as is rightly inferred from <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>, preceded him; Joel also is usually regarded as before him in point of time; neither can it denote his priority to Isaiah and <span class="accented">Amos</span>, who also prophesied in the days of Uzziah. The plain meaning is that which becomes obvious when we adopt the right rendering of Gesenius, as given above, that is, the beginning of the prophecies which Hoses was commissioned by Jehovah to make known. The peculiarity of the expression, "<span class="accented">in</span> Hosea," as the word literally means, deserves attention. Maurer compares <a href="../../par/numbers/12-2.htm">Numbers 12:2, 6</a>, and 8, to prove that the expression signifies speaking to rather than in or <span class="accented">by</span>; he also cites other passages to the same purpose, But while the verb "to speak," followed by b5 and the verb constructed with <span class="accented">el</span>, may coincide in signification at a certain point, it does not thence follow that they are everywhere and always synonymous. Long ago Jerome drew attention to the distinction which this difference of construction suggests. "It is one thing," says that Father, "for the Lord to speak <span class="accented">in</span> Hosea, another to speak to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Hosea: when it is in Hosea he does not speak to Hosea himself, but <span class="accented">by</span> Hosea to others; but speaking <span class="accented">to</span> Hosea denotes communication to himself. So in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) we find the corresponding Greek expression, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which the Revised Version rightly renders, "God having...  spoken the ... in the prophets." The first verse is the general heading for the whole book; the first clause of the second verse is the special heading of the first section of the book, which extends to the end of the third chapter. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms.</span> Whether the transaction here enjoined is to be understood as a reality, or a vision, or an allegory, has been keenly debated. To enter fully into the discussion of this point would lead us too far from our purpose; nor could it minister to edification. Though high authorities have maintained it to be a real occurrence, we do not see our way to concur with their view. A canon of interpretation sanctioned by Augustine forbids the literal acceptation of this command, for, according to the canon referred to, if the language of Scripture taken literally would involve something incongruous or morally improper, the figurative sense must be preferred. Again, we can scarcely understand it of a vision; for there is no mention of or reference to anything of that kind in the passage, nor does the context countenance the notion of a vision. Keil regards it as such when he speaks of it as "an inward and spiritual intuition in which the word of God was addressed" to the prophet. We are, therefore, shut up to that interpretation which explains the whole as an allegorical or imaginary narrative, which is thus constructed in order to impart greater vividness to the prophet's declaration. The Chaldee paraphrase understands it in this sense. "Go," says the paraphrast, "declare a prophecy against the inhabitants of the idolatrous city, who persist in sin." Jerome also explains it allegorically, and urges against the literal sense that passage in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is commanded by God to bear the iniquity of the house of Israel, and to lie upon his left side three hundred and ninety days - a thing impossible according to the literal understanding of the injunction; he accordingly concludes, in reference to the particulars here commanded, that "sacramenta indicaut futurorum." Calvin rightly understands it in the sense of a parabolic representation as follows: '" The Lord had bidden him (the prophet) to relate this parable, so to speak, or this similitude, that the people might see, as in a living portraiture, their turpitude and perfidiousness. It is, in short, an exhibition in which the thing itself is not only set forth in words, but is also placed, as it were, before their eyes in a visible form." Kimchi considers it to be a prophetic vision; while some of the older Hebrew interpreters viewed it in the light of an actual transaction. Kimchi's words are: "And the whole took place in the vision of prophecy, not that Hoses the prophet had taken to himself a wife of whoredoms; although it is found in the words of our rabbins that the meaning is according to the literal signification of the words." By "a wife of whoredoms" we understand a woman addicted to whoredoms, and thus likely to prove an unfaithful wife, as" a woman of quarrels" is a quarrelsome woman, "a man of bloods" is a bloody man, "a man of sorrows" a sorrowful man; while "children of whoredoms" are children who follow in the footsteps of their mother's lewdness, or children on whose birth their mother's licentiousness bad left a stigma so <span class="accented">that</span> their legitimacy is questionable. The construction of the verb "take," with both objects, is an example of the figure zeugma, by which one word does duty to two clauses, though it undergoes a modification of sense in its application to the second. The meaning here is clearly that the prophet should take a wife of the character indicated, and beget children by her, not <span class="accented">take</span> such a wife and such children already born to her. This view is favored by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sume tibi uxorem fornicationum et fac tibi filios fornicationum</span>; though Keil maintains that Hosea was to take children of prostitution as well as a wife who had lived by prostitution. <span class="cmt_word">For the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord.</span> This is more exactly rendered, <span class="accented">for the land hath utterly gone a-whoring from after</span> (that is, <span class="accented">from following</span>) <span class="accented">the Lord</span>. From this we learn the symbolic import of the command, in whatever way that command is interpreted, whether as a reality, or vision, or allegory, the prophet's marriage to an unfaithful wife sets forth Jehovah's marriage to an unfaithful nation. God often condescends - graciously condescends - to represent his relation to his people as a marriage covenant; while unfaithfulness on their part is spiritual adultery. The mother and the children may represent the country and its inhabitants, or the nation as a whole and its several members, or generally the people and their <span class="accented">posterity</span> in succeeding generations. The father of the Hebrew race had served other gods on the other side of the flood, that is, in Ur, in the land of the Chaldees, whence God had called Abraham. When taken into covenant relationship, how often had they fallen into the former sin of idolatry! The fearful consequences of their sin is graphically portrayed in the verses immediately following, symbolized in the names of the prophet's children. They are - national ruin, the loss of the Divine favor, and the forfeiture of their proud position as the chosen people of Jehovah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-3.htm">Hosea 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son</span>. Kimchi conjectures that "Gomer was the name of a harlot well known at that time;" he also explains the name, according to his view of its symbolic import, as follows: "Gomer has the meaning of completion;" as if the prophet said, He will fully execute on them the punishment of their transgressions that he may forgive their iniquity." The names of the children born to the prophet are significant and symbolical; and their symbolic significance is explained. The names mentioned in this verse are also significant, though their significance is not expressly stated, as in the former case; the cause of the omission being the fact that these names were not, like the others, now received for the first time, but simply retained. Gomer denotes "completion" or" consummation," from a verbal root signifying "to perfect" or "come to an end; and Diblaim is the dual of <span class="accented">deblelah</span>, the plural being <span class="accented">debhelim</span>, from the verb <span class="accented">dabhal, to</span> press together into a mass, especially a round mass. The meaning of the word, then, is "<span class="accented">two</span> cakes," that is, of dried figs pressed together in lumps. It may be observed, in passing, that the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> seems to come from the Aramaic form <span class="accented">debhalta</span>, by the omission of the initial <span class="accented">daleth</span>. But what is the mystic meaning which the prophet veils under the two names Consummation and Compressed fig-cakes (cakes of <span class="accented">compressed</span> figs)? The one may hint not obscurely consummation in sin and in the suffering which is the ultimate consequence of sin; while the other may imply the sweetness of sensual indulgences, especially such as idolatrous celebrants were prone to. If, then, the symbolical interpretation of these names be allowable, we may accept that given by Jerome. He says, "<span class="accented">Out</span> of Israel is taken typically by Hosea a wife <span class="accented">consummated in</span> fornication, and a perfect <span class="accented">daughter of pleasure</span> which seems sweet and pleasant to those who enjoy it." There is, moreover, an obvious appropriateness in the names thus symbolically understood. The prophet, whose name signifies "salvation," marries a woman who was a daughter of plea. sure and a votary of sin; this alliance represents the relation into which Jehovah, with his saving power, had mercifully taken Israel; but that people, unmindful and unthankful for such mercy, and intent on the indulgence of a sinful course, went from bad to worse in apostasy and idolatry till God at length left them in their impenitence and abandoned them to their fate. The conception and birth of Gomer's son to the prophet, though several authorities omit "him," give no countenance to the idea of the child being supposititious; and so far there seems to be some confirmation of the opinion of Keil referred to under ver. 2. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little <i>while</i>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel</span>. The name which the people inherited from a distinguished ancestor was one of honor and dignity - Israel or Yisrael, "<span class="accented">prince</span> with God;" the name imposed by their <span class="accented">sins</span> was one of reproach and disaster - Izreel, or Yizreel, "<span class="accented">scattered</span> by God." The Hebrews had a peculiar fondness for a paronomasia of this kind; thus Bethel, "<span class="accented">house</span> of God," becomes Bethaven, "<span class="accented">house</span> of vanity." Keil regrets the appellative sense in this passage, and refers to the historical importance of the place. The latter view seems favored by the succeeding explanation of the name. <span class="cmt_word">For yet a little while, and I will avenge</span> (<span class="accented">visit</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu</span>. The verb here rendered "avenge" is literally to "visit," and is used sometimes in a good sense, implying a benevolent purpose, as in <a href="../../par/ruth/1-6.htm">Ruth 1:6</a>, "For she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread;" sometimes it expresses a hostile intention, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children." In the present passage, as elsewhere in this book (see <a href="../../par/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>), it is taken in the sense assigned it in the Authorized Version, with which the Septuagint and Syriac are in accord. But what are we to understand by the <span class="accented">blood of Jezreel</span>, which brought down this vengeance on the house of Jehu? Some suppose that the expression denotes the bloody deeds of Ahab's house, including, not only the murder of Naboth, but also their bloody persecution of the servants and prophets of Jehovah, as we read in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>, that "<span class="accented">Jezebel</span> cut off the prophets of the Lord;" and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-7.htm">2 Kings 9:7</a>, "Thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel." These and like deeds of blood brought down retribution on the house of Ahab; Jehu, the instrument of this retribution, was himself guilty of such enormities that the cry of blood for vengeance was repeated, and the criminality of the preceding dynasty continuing, the <span class="accented">ate</span> of Jehu's was redoubled. This view appears to us both clumsy and far-fetched. The plain meaning is that which refers the blood of Jezreel to the bloody massacres of Jehn himself, when in a single day he put an end to the dynasty of Omri and the wicked house of Ahab. On that memorable occasion he slew the queen-mother Jezebel, the seventy sons of Ahab, and forty-two relatives of King Ahaziah, also all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. The royal house of Israel he exterminated, for he "<span class="accented">slew</span> all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolk, and his priests, until he left him none remaining;" the royal house or' Judah he brought at the same time to the very verge of extinction. The slaughter of Ahab's sons, of Jezebel and Joram, and that whole royal line, was, it is true, in compliance with God's express command; and, for the measure of his obedience to that command, Jehu was rewarded by the promise of his family occupying the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. But what was the motive that prompted this performance of the Divine will? Was it really zeal for God, as he pretended, and consequent diligence in obeying the Divine direction? Or did human passion predominate and political advantage hurry him on? We trow not. Certain it is that his subsequent career rendered the purity of his zeal more than doubtful. He exterminated the idolatry of Baal, but he clave to the calves of Jeroboam at Bethel and Dan - the fundamental sin of the kings of Israel. In what he did, therefore, the act itself was right, for God commanded it; but the motive was wrong, for it was selfish ambition that prompted it. Thus it was with Baasha; he executed vengeance by command of God on the wicked house of Jeroboam I., and for so doing was exalted to be prince over God's people Israel; but the word of the Lord came against him, as we read, "For all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord... in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him." The Chaldee regards the blood shed by Jehu in Jezreel, though shed in a righteous cause and for the rooting out of the Baal idolatry, as innocent blood, because Jehu himself and his house turned aside to the idolatry of the calves. Jerome takes a similar view of the matter. Kimchi adopts the same; his words, literally translated, are the following: "And why does he call it the blood of Jezreel? Because it was shod in Jezreel. And though in this matter he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet, since he did not observe to walk in the Law of Jehovah, and did not turn aside from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the blood which he shed was reckoned to him as innocent blood." He then adduces as a parallel the case of Baasha already mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">And will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</span> Jeroboam II., the third of Jehu's family, was now reigning; a fourth member of the same was to occupy the throne. That fourth sovereign was Zechariah, whose short inglorious reign lasted only six months, at the expiration of which he fell a victim in the conspiracy by Shallum. Thus ended the dynasty of Jehu; while its overthrow paralyzed the strength of the northern kingdom. Anti, though the day of its complete destruction was deferred for half a century, yet the disorders, dethronements, anarchy at times, and repeated assassination of the sovereigns, to which Menahem was the only exception, prepared the way for the final catastrophe. The overthrow of the house of Jehu has been aptly termed by Hengstenberg "the beginning of the end, the commencement of the process of decomposition." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-5.htm">Hosea 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it shall some to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel</span>. Here we have a prediction of a most momentous event, with express statement of the place where it should occur, as also the time of its occurrence. The event itself was more than the downfall of a dynasty; it was the destruction of a kingdom. The date of that destruction is defined simply as the period when God would punish the sins of both the princes and people of Israel The close of Jehu's dynasty was at once the preparation for and the commencement of the cessation of the kingdom of Israel. The place of this calamity was the Valley of Jezreel. This famous valley was the cockpit of Palestine. There Israel conquered the host of King Jabin; there Gideon overthrew the Midianites; there Saul was defeated by the Philistines, when driven up the slopes of Gilbea "<span class="accented">the</span> beauty of Israel was slain in thy high places;" there a defeat equally sorrowful and not less disastrous was aggravated by the death of good King Josiah, and proved fatal to the kingdom of Judah; there, too, in later times, the last conflict took place between the Crusaders and the Moslems, in which victory crowned the arms of Saladin; there, also, was fought the battle, as we learn from this passage, which decided the fate of the kingdom of Israel. The situation of this valley was admirably suited for such scenes. This plain, or valley, broad as it is beautiful, begins where the maritime plain, interrupted by the ridge of Carmel, turns aside and extends across the center of the country from the Mediterranean Sea on the west to the Jordan valley on the east, and from the hills of Galilee on the north to those of Ephraim or Samaria on the south. The form of this plain is triangular; its eastern side or base is fifteen miles, reaching from Engannim, now <span class="accented">Jenin</span>, to the hills below Nazareth; the north side along the hills of Galilee is twelve miles; the southern, formed by the hills of Samaria, is eighteen miles; while the apex of this somewhat irregular triangle is a narrow pass through which the river Kishon - "<span class="accented">that</span> ancient river, the river Kishon" - with its winding stream makes its way to the sea. On the east there are three branches in the direction of the Jordan, which bear a remote resemblance to the fingers of a hand. The northern branch <span class="accented">passes</span> between Tabor and Little Hermon, or <span class="accented">Jebel ed-Duhy</span>; the central one, which is the Valley of Jezreel proper, runs between Shunem and Jezreel, now <span class="accented">Zerin</span>; the southern between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim, now <span class="accented">Jenia - this</span> branch, having no outlet, loses itself among the eastern hills. The name of this plain was derived from the city of Jezreel, situated near its eastern extremity on a spur of Mount Gilboa, which Ahab chose as a royal residence, and which remained so for three successive reigns, though in the time of Jeroboam II. Samaria had again, as in the days of Omri, become the royal city. In this great plain, called by the Greeks Esdraelon, the bow of Israel was to be broken. The bow (<span class="accented">qesheth, tad</span>. <span class="accented">qashah</span>, hard, stiff,  unbending) was the warrior's weapon of offence and defense - strong and powerful; the breaking of his bow deprived him of his chief weapon, and left him at the mercy of the enemy to conquer or to kill; thus we read, "His bow abode in strength;" and again, "My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand." But while such general references prove the bow to have been an emblem of strength and power, as Kimchi explains it, still there is something very special and suitable in the expression of the prophet here. "In one important respect," says the author of the 'Jewish Church,' "the ancient military glory of Israel was, if not confined to the northern kingdom yet regarded as eminently characteristic of it. Judah, with all its warlike qualities, had never been celebrated for its archery. The use of the bow was there a late acquisition (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>). But in Benjamin and Ephraim it had been an habitual weapon. The bow of Jonathan was known far and wide. The children of Ephraim were characterized as 'carrying bows.' And so the chief weapon of the captain of the host of Israel was his bow. The King of Israel had always his bow and arrows with him. The sign of the fall of the kingdom was the breaking of the bow of Israel." The language employed by the prophet was thus singularly appropriate. An historical basis, though denied by some and pronounced precarious by others, is, we have little doubt, found for this prediction in <a href="../../par/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a> of this very book. The bow, that is, the archery in which Israel excelled so much, was broken in the Valley of Jezreel, when Shalmon, identified with Shalman-ezer, King of Assyria by Pusey and Stanley, spoiled Beth-Arbel, or Arbela, the city between Sepphoris and Tiberias, and near the middle of the valley, and thus crushed Israel in an overwhelming defeat. If the identification be sustained, that day of battle was most calamitous to Israel, and as cruel as calamitous, for neither the helplessness of infancy nor the tenderness of womanhood was spared; the infants were dashed to death against the stones, and the mothers then hurled in mortal agony upon the dead bodies of their little ones. Kimchi explains it generally: "On that day when I shall visit the blood of Jezreel, I shall break the bow of Israel, that is to <span class="accented">say</span>, their might and power." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-6.htm">Hosea 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter.

And God said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah. The first birth symbolized the blood-guiltiness and idolatry of Israel, and the consequent destruction. Two other births follow to confirm the certainty of the coming calamity, to develop it further, and exhibit the nation ever which it impended under new phases, as also to show the prospect of deliverance to be hopeless. The change of sex may indicate the totality of the nation, male and female, as Keil thinks; or rather the weak and defenseless condition of Israel after their bow was broken and their power crushed by the enemy. They are new ready to be led into captivity, like a female helpless and powerless and exposed to ell the insults of the conquerors. The birth of the daughter is thus explained by Kimchi: "After she had borne a so which is a proverbial reference to Jeroboam the son of Joash...  she bore a daughter, who refers parabolically to Zechariah and to Shallum son of Jabesh, who reigned after him, who were weak as a female." The name given to the child is <span class="accented">Unpitied</span>, or Unfavored, if <span class="accented">ruchamah be</span> taken as a mutilated participle, the initial <span class="accented">mere</span> being dropped, though it is not found in close connection with a participle; or, <span class="accented">She-is-not-pitied</span>, if the word be a verb. In either case, the mercy which if exercised would save her from the miseries of captivity, is clean gone; and the love which, if it existed, would prompt that exercise of mercy, is no longer to be looked for. <span class="cmt_word">For I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away</span> (margin, <span class="accented">that I should altogether pardon them</span>). Aben Ezra quotes the correct meaning as follows: "Some say that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> is that I have up till now forgiven their iniquity; "and Kimchi: "Hitherto I have forgiven and pardoned them, because I have had mercy upon them; but I shall continue to do so no more." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">again</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, to return or repeat. The construction of the first clause is peculiar. Rosenm&uuml;ller cites as parallel <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>; but more exact parallels are <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a> and <a href="../../par/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>, in both of which, and also in the text, Kimchi and Aben Ezra understand <span class="accented">asker</span> before the second verb. The last clause of the verse, however, presents a real difficulty, as we may infer from the variety of interpretations to which it has been subjected. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "But I will surely set myself in array against them." Jerome, confounding the verb with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> translates, "But I will entirely forget them." Rashi: "I will <span class="accented">distribute to them a portion of their cup</span> and of their deeds," viz. as they have deserved by their deeds, Kimchi: "I will <span class="accented">raise up enemies against them</span>, who shall carry them into captivity and lay waste their land."Aben Ezra: "I will take them away;" he quotes for this meaning of the text <a href="../../par/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>, and takes the prefix <span class="accented">le</span> as the Aramaic sign of the accusative, giving as a notable example of the same <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>, <span class="accented">haregu leabner</span> for <span class="accented">eth-abner</span>. The Syriac Version is similar. A more feasible rendering, if the meaning of "take away" be retained, is that of Hengstenberg and others, who translate it: "I will utterly take away from them, or with regard to them," viz. everything. We prefer the sense of "pardon," as given in the Chaldee; in the margin of the Authorized Version; by Ewald, Wunsche, and Delitzsch; and mentioned by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. Thus it will read: "I will no more favor them that I should verily forgive them." The flint verb literally means the pitiful yearning of parental love - the strong feeling of affection which the Greeks expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>. Paul's rendering of the word with the privative denotes absence of love; and Peter's the absence of mercy. Both notions are contained in the word, and their relation is well explained by Pussy, who says, It is <span class="accented">tender love</span> in him who pitieth; mercy as shown to him who needeth mercy." Now, the connection between such tenderness of love and forgiving mercy is natural and close. Many an instance of this had been experienced in the previous history of Israel; many a time God's compassion had been extended to his erring people, notwithstanding their manifold provocations; but that day is gone - the Divine long-suffering is exhausted. Once Israel is carried captive, there shall be no return; no mercy to restore them, as in the case of Judah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-7.htm">Hosea 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God.</span> Thus the contrast expressed in this verse increases the painful feelings with which the threatened abandonment and consequent destruction of Israel would be regarded. The promised mercy to the house of Judah is emphasized by the peculiar form of the expression. Instead of the pronoun, the proper name of Jehovah is employed; instead of saying, "I will save them by myself," he says in a specially emphatic manner, "I will save them by <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>," adding at the same time the important adjunct of "thy God," to remind them of that relationship to himself in virtue of which he interposes thus personally and powerfully on their behalf. An expression somewhat similar in form occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>, "Then the Lord [Jehovah] rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord [Jehovah] out of heaven." <span class="cmt_word">And will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle</span> (literally, war), <span class="cmt_word">by horses, nor by horsemen</span>. This enumeration is quite in accordance with the prophet's style, as may be seen at a glance by comparing <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 11, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; and Hosea 4:13. The manner of this deliverance is very peculiar and unusual; while prominence is given to the absence of those means of defense or deliverance on which the northern kingdom so much relied. The deliverance would be accomplished without the ordinary weapons of war - bow and sword, in the use of the former of which Israel was so celebrated; also without war, that is, without its appliances and <span class="accented">material</span> of whatever kind - skilful commanders, brave soldiers, and numerous troops; likewise without horses and horsemen, a great source of strength in those days (<span class="accented">parashim</span>, equivalent to "riders on horses," as distinguished from <span class="accented">rokebhim</span>, riders on camels). This deliverance, in fact, was to be entirely independent of all human resources. All this points plainly and positively to the deliverance of Judah from Sennacherib in the days of Hezekiah, when in one night the angel of the Lord smote a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the flower of the Assyrian host, and Jehovah thus by himself delivered Judah. Thus, too, Judah is saved from that power before which Israel had previously and entirely succumbed. (Compare, on this miraculous deliverance, <a href="../../par/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>. and <a href="../../par/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</span> As Eastern mothers nurse their children some two or three years, the process of weaning at the end of that period would imply a corresponding interval. This may be merely an incident to complete the prophetic declaration, and pleasingly vary the narrative. It is rather, we think, a pause in the progress of the approaching calamity - a pause indicative of the Divine lothness to execute the final sentence. Or the weaning may be referred, with some, to the entire withdrawal of all spiritual nourishment and support, when promise and prophecy, instruction and consolation, symbol and sacrifice, would be abolished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then said <i>God</i>, Call his name Loammi: for ye <i>are</i> not my people, and I will not be your <i>God</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said God, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</span> Here we have the climax of Israel's fate. The prophet's children, whether actual, visionary, or allegorical, symbolized step by step the sad gradation in Israel's fast-coming calamity. The name Jezreel, whether taken to mean their being scattered by God or their suffering the sorrowful consequences of their multiplied delinquencies, m either ease denotes the first blow dealt to them by Divine providence. Bat from that it was possible by repentance to recover; and, though dispersed, they were not beyond the reach of the Divine compassion, nor beyond the power of the Divine arm to collect and bring together again. But <span class="accented">Lo-ruhammah</span>, Unpitied, or Uncompassionated, imports another and a still heavier blow; and, though dispersed far and near, and though left in the places of their dispersion without pity and without compassion, still there might be a good time coming in the near or in the distant future, when a favorable change in their circumstances would be brought about so that they would be both collected together, or comforted and compassionated. The name <span class="accented">Lo-ammi</span>, however, puts an end to hope, implying as it does a total rejection and an entire renunciation of the people of Israel on the part of the Almighty. The national covenant is annulled; God has cast off his people, who are thus left hopeless as helpless, because of their sinful and ungrateful departure from the Source of all mercy and the Fountain of all blessing. The expression of this is very touching: "Ye" says God, now addressing them directly and personally, "are not - are no longer, my people; and I will not be yours." Such is the literal rendering of this now sad but once tender expression - tender, unspeakably tender, as long as applicable; sad, inexpressibly sad, now that its enjoyment is forever gone. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people, <i>there</i> it shall be said unto them, <i>Ye are</i> the sons of the living God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered.</span> The division of the verses at this place is faulty both in our common Hebrew Bibles and in the Authorized Version. The former connects vers. 10 and 11 with the second chapter, and the latter closes the first chapter with these verses, and thus detaches them from the first verse of the second chapter. The correct arrangement combines vers. 10 and 11 of <a href="../../par/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1</a>. with ver. 1 of <a href="../../par/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>, and concludes the first chapter with these three verses which are so closely joined together in sense. Here is the usual cycle of events - human sinfulness, deserved punishment, and Divine mercy. Had the last element been wanting, the promise of a countless posterity made to Abraham, renewed to Isaac, and confirmed to Jacob, might appear abolished. Yet, notwithstanding the rejection of Israel, the Word of God remaineth sure. But who are the children of Israel, whose multitude, like sea-saint, defies numeration and measurement? The whole posterity of Jacob or Israel might seem included, as the words of the promise made to that patriarch and those of the present prediction so closely correspond; and Israel is occasionally taken in this wide and general sense. The context is opposed to this; especially does the distinction so sharply marked in the succeeding verse militate against this. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, <span class="cmt_word">Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.</span> The place where this great change takes place is either the place where their rejection was foretold, or that where its fulfillment became an accomplished fact. The former was, as is obvious, Palestine; the latter, the place of their exile, and so the lands of their dispersion. Thus the Chaldee, adopting the latter, renders freely as follows: "And it shall come to pass in the place where they lived in exile among the peoples, when they transgressed my Law and it was said to them, Ye are not my people, they will turn and be magnified, and called the people of God." Once this change takes place, their true mission shall be attained and their relations to the living God shall be readjusted. The dumb, dead idols, to which they had bowed down in the days of their apostasy and unbelief shall be cast aside and away for ever. Jehovah the Living One alone shall be the object of their adoration in that day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great <i>shall be</i> the day of Jezreel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land.</span> The phraseology of the older Scriptures is here followed. Thus we read in <a href="../../par/exodus/1-10.htm">Exodus 1:10</a>, in the words of Pharaoh, the children of Israel "getting them up out of the land" (comp. also <a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/32-11.htm">Numbers 32:11</a>); and again, on the report of the spies when the people murmured against Moses and Aaron, "they said one to another, Let us make a captain [head], and let us return into Egypt." In this way the scenes of former days were in some sense to be repeated: an exodus of some sort was again to take place; Egypt was to be abandoned and slavery left behind; they might have a wilderness to traverse, but here again the prospect of a land of promise was to cheer them on their journey and compensate them at its close; in fact, another or better Canaan was before them. Nay, more, the breach between Judah and Israel would be healed, and the disruption which had been so disastrous become a thing of the past. Judah and Israel would again unite and rally together under one head. But the important inquiry remains as to the how or when this prediction was to have fulfillment. Even if we admit the return from the captivity of Babylon to be a fulfillment, it would be but a very partial, though literal, fulfillment of such a grand prediction. That restoration was far too meager in its dimensions to come up to the requirements of, much less exhaust, such a splendid prophecy. Some of Israel - a mere fragment of the ten tribes - united with Judah in the relearn from Babylon: this poor miniature fulfillment, if we may so say, cannot be regarded, except perhaps typically or symbolically, as the fulfillment of the prophet's vivid picture. We must look to gospel times and gospel scenes for the realization of the glorious promise under consideration. Jewish interpreters themselves refer it to the times of Messiah. Thus Kimchi says, "This shall take place in the gathering together of the exiles in the days of the Messiah, for unto the second house there went up only Judah and Benjamin that had been exiles in Babylon; nor were the children of Judah and the children of Israel gathered together; and they shall make for themselves one head, - this is the King Messiah;" similarly, in the 'Betsudath David,' by Altschul, we read on this passage," <span class="accented">They shall be gathered together</span>: this will come to pass in the days of the Messiah. <span class="accented">One head</span>: this is the King Messiah. <span class="accented">And they shall come up</span>; out of the lands of the captivity they shall go up unto their own land." We cannot possibly mistake the objects of this prophecy; they are expressly declared to be "the children of Judah and the children of Israel" - the two distinctive branches of the Hebrew race, the two constituent elements of the Jewish nationality, and comprehending the whole natural posterity of Israel. There can be just as little doubt about the primary and proper application of the prophecy to the conversion of the people of the Jews. For a time they were not to be the people of God; but the testimony of the prophet to their again becoming the sons of the living God is quite unmistakable. They shall appoint themselves one head. "The prophet," says Calvin, "has, by the expression, characterized the obedience of faith; for it is not enough that Christ should be given as a King, and set over men, unless they also embrace him as their King, and with reverence receive him. We now learn that, when we believe the gospel, we choose Christ for our King, as it were, by a voluntary consent." The words are adopted by both Peter and Paul: the former (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>) employs them as an appropriate description, in Old Testament language, of the happy change of condition consequent on the knowledge of the truth; the latter (<a href="../../par/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>) quotes them more formally in an extension of their meaning beyond their primary import, and proper and literal application to the Jews, as an exemplification of the principle of <span class="accented">once not my people, now my people</span>. In this extension of their meaning they embrace, no doubt, the Gentiles, though not the objects originally and chiefly contemplated in the prophecy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the place mentioned in the previous verse be, the place or lands of their dispersion, on the change indicated taking place, namely, their conversion to Christ as King, then their coming up out of the laud under the sole headship of the Son of David, the true Shepherd of Israel, may denote their restoration out of all the countries of their dispersion to their ancient territory, again become their own land, and their own in perpetual possession. Thus the Targum understands it of the land of the Jews' captivity; likewise Kimchi: "They shall go up out of the land of their captivity to their own land; for the laud of Israel is higher than all lands, and he that goeth thither goeth up, and he that goeth out of it goeth down." The initial and typical fulfillment was the return of Judah, joined by many Israelites, out of Babylon under Zerubbabel. The final fulfillment may be the restoration of the Jews, converted and believing in Messiah, under Divine guidance, to their own land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> If, on the other hand, the place of the preceding verse be Palestine, the land of their rejection and subsequent recognition as the sons of God, the going up may refer to the going up of the inhabitants of both kingdoms to Jerusalem, the dwelling-place of their common king of David's line; not in the sense of going up, as Ewald and others understand it, to do battle in order to widen the boundaries of their native hind and make room for the returning exiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> But whether the place be the country of Palestine or the lands of their dispersion, the going up may be understood spiritually of their coming up to join themselves to the Church, or rather to the Church's Head, as under the old economy the tribes of Israel went up out of all parts of the land to worship at Jerusalem. It will thus apply properly enough to their spiritual journey onward and upward to the heavenly Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">For great shall be the day of Jezreel.</span> The names of the prophet's children were names of ill omen - God's sowing in the sense of God's <span class="accented">scattering</span>, Not-my-people, Not-pitied; now the evil is eliminated, the meaning of the second and third is reversed, and the first is read in a new signification, so that Not-my-people becomes My people, Unpitied becomes Pitied, God's sowing is no longer God's scattering but God's growing. The curse is thus changed into a blessing; great, then, shall be the day so signalized by Divine goodness, so glorious in Divine grace, and so conspicuous for the wondrous works of the covenant-keeping God. Most of the older interpreters take <span class="accented">Jezreel</span> here, as in vers. 4 and 5, equivalent to "scattered of God." Aben Ezra says, "But the iniquity of the house of Israel is punished. And behold, it is all said by way of reproach, not praise." <span class="cmt_sub_title"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span> Divine mercy being now received, the recipients are urged to extend to each other the right hand of fellowship, exhorting one another, encouraging one smother, confirming each other in the faith, and mutually provoking each other to love and good works. "Because the comparison deals with a son and a daughter, the prophet therefore adds, 'your brothers and your sisters'" (Kimchi). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hosea/2.htm"><title>Hosea 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hosea/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hosea/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hosea/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hosea/1.htm" title="Hosea 1">&#9668;</a> Hosea 2 <a href="../hosea/3.htm" title="Hosea 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</div><div class="comm">

The cycle is the common one of sin: its usual consequences of suffering and sorrow; then succor and sympathy in case of repentance. The persons addressed in the verse before us are those individuals in Israel who had still retained their integrity, and who, notwithstanding surrounding defection and abounding ungodliness, had continued steadfast in their loyalty and love to the Lord. They might be few in number, widely scattered, perhaps unknown to each other, and of comparatively little note; yet they are here called on to raise their voice in solemn warning and earnest protest against the national defection and wickedness. "<span class="accented">The</span> congregation in its totality, or whole people taken conjointly, is compared to the mother, but individual members to the children, and the sense is that they are to plead with each other to bring them back to the way of goodness" (Kimchi). The nation as such, and in its impiety, is the mother; the pious persons still found in it are here required to testify for God both by exhortation and example. "The congregation of Israel is compared to an adulteress, and the children of the different generations to the children of whoredoms. Before them the prophet <span class="accented">says</span>, 'Plead with your mother'" (Kimchi). Adultery per <span class="accented">se</span> is a virtual dissolution of the marriage-tie; idolatry is spiritual adultery; the close and tender relationship into which God has graciously condescended to take Israel is rendered null and void, and that through Israel's own fault. God threatens the renunciation of it, unless perchance the pleading of the still faithful children might recall the erring mother to penitence and purity. A case the converse of this is that presented in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, where the mother's divorce is attributed to the unfaithfulness of the children. "<span class="accented">Where</span>," asks the Lord in that passage, "<span class="accented">is</span> the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away?...  for your <span class="accented">transgressions</span> is your mother put away." <span class="accented">Ki</span> before the second clause is either recitative, introducing the words of pleading, or assigns a reason; the latter seems preferable. Let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts. The word <span class="accented">mippaneyha is</span> rather to be rendered "from her face" than "out of her sight." The expression is to be taken literally, as the word "breasts" in the parallel clause proves. Thus Kimchi rightly explains it, saying, "Since he compares her to harlot, he attributes to her the ways of harlots; for the harlot's way is to adorn her face with various kinds of colors, that she may appear fair in the eyes of her paramours." But in addition to ornamenteth as earrings or nose-rings, and other ways of decking herself, as by painting, the expression may imply lascivious looks and wanton expressions of countenance; while the mention of breasts may indicate the making of them bare for the purpose of meretricious blandishments, or as indicating the place of the adulterer (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a> and <a href="../../par/songs/1-13.htm">Song of Solomon 1:13</a>). The Jewish commentators adopt the latter sense. Aben Ezra comments on the grammatical form of the words <span class="accented">teuncha</span> and <span class="accented">naaphupheha</span> (the former by duplication of the second radical, and the latter by that of the third) as intensive; while Rashi and Kimchi refer to the pressure of the breasts. But others understand them figuratively, the countenance indicating boldness, and the breasts shamelessness. Thus Horace speaks of the brilliant beauty (<span class="accented">nixor</span>) and coquettishness (<span class="accented">protervitas</span>) of Glyeera. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-3.htm">Hosea 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born.</span> The Lord, by his servant the prophet, enforces the preceding exhortation by a stern denunciation, and the threat of further severities unless averted by repentance; as an injured husband withdraws from a faithless wife all the gifts and presents he had made for her adornment, leaving her poor and bare. Not only the removal of her garments by way of degradation and disgrace, but exposure in that position to insult and ignominy would ensue. In other words, the nation is threatened with deprivation of all the blessings previously lavished upon them - property, prosperity, population, and privileges; while dishonor of the deepest dye would aggravate the misery. The day of the nation's birth denotes the weakness and wretchedness of their infant state. To this corresponded their servile, suffering condition during their bondage and oppression in Egypt. Rashi thus explains it; Kimchi says, "The figure of birth is the time they are slaves in Egypt;" so also Theodoret, - the latter calls the day of her birth the sojourn in Egypt. The Prophet Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>) expands the idea, occasionally employing, as Rosenm&uuml;ller remarks, the very words of Hosea. <span class="cmt_word">And make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and clay her with thirst.</span> This part of the verse is susceptible of two explanations. The faithless female, under which character the northern kingdom is personified, may be compared to a wilderness, that is, according to Cyril, fruitless, parched, and productive only of thorns, thirsty and waterless. This comparison of a woman to a desert is wanting in suitability, and seems in some degree awkward in itself, beside being out of harmony with the closing clause; for to "<span class="accented">slay</span> with thirst," however applicable to a person, cannot with any propriety be said of a place, whether desert or otherwise. No doubt the wilderness may stand for those dwelling in it. We prefer, therefore, the alternative rendering, "make her as <span class="accented">in</span> a wilderness, and set her as <span class="accented">in</span> a dry land." Rashi aptly explains the threat to mean, "<span class="accented">Lest</span> I pronounce against them such a sentence as of old in this desert (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35</a>), 'In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.'" There <span class="accented">is</span>, moreover, a natural connection of ideas between a wilderness, a dry land, and thirst. The nation's birth, represented by or compared to their sojourn in Egypt, naturally suggests the idea of their wandering in the wilderness after their exodus from that country; a wilderness, again, suggests what is an ordinary feature of such a district, namely, a dry land; while a region thus without water is suggestive as well as provocative of thirst. The former explanation, however, is given by Kimehi: "I will make thee like the wilderness which is open to every one, and in which, moreover, one finds no means of subsistence, nor anything that man needs; so I'll withdraw my goodness from them, and they shall be surrendered as a prey to every one." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they <i>be</i> the children of whoredoms.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.</span> The connection of this verse is carried on from the preceding, viz. <span class="accented">and lest I will not have mercy upon her children</span>. An exceedingly apt illustration of this verse is given by Jerome. It is to this effect: When the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, the parents perished in the wilderness; but the children of those who had thus perished, and whose caresses had thus fallen in the wilderness, were spared and permitted to enter the land of promise. Now, however, the case is different, and the punishment aggravated. The adulterous parent perishes, and the children of that parent perish also. Further, the reason is assigned in the concluding clause. The children proved themselves no better than the mother that bore them; they were the worthless progeny of a worthless parent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give <i>me</i> my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath dons shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers.</span> The charge of idolatry under the figure of harlotry, spiritual harlotry, is reiterated. "Mother" is repeated in and emphasized by the parallel words, "she that conceived them." A somewhat similar form of expression is that in <a href="../../par/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>, "The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." To <span class="accented">bosh</span>, to be ashamed, belong the Hiphil forms, <span class="accented">hebhish</span> and <span class="accented">hobhish</span> (the latter formed from <span class="accented">zabhish</span>), properly "to put to shame," but also "to practice shame or do shameful things." The nature of her shameful conduct is more definitely and distinctly expressed in the clauses which follow; and consisted of several particulars. There is the persistent pursuit of her lovers; then the unblushing boldness with which she avows her determination to continue that course; and next come her expectations from them. <span class="cmt_word">That give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink</span> (margin, <span class="accented">drinks</span>). The original word here rendered "lovers" is the Piel participle, which may have either its usual intensive sense or its occasional causative sense in which it is taken by Rosenm&uuml;ller, who has "a-mare me facientes," equivalent to "wooers." It matters little which way we understand it. The more important point is to determine who or what are here meant by lovers. Most commentators understand them to be those nations whose friendship Israel set such store by - the Assyrians and the Egyptians. Thus Grotius and Jerome, - the latter explains them of the Assyrians and Egyptians and other nations, with whose idols Israel committed fornication, and from which in distress they vainly hoped for help; so also Kimchi, in the following comment: "By 'friends ' he implies the Assyrians and Egyptians joined in alliance to the Israelites, who delivered them from their enemies, so that they lived safely, in return for the gifts (tribute) which they (the Israelites) were in the habit of giving them. And as they lived in tranquility in virtue of the compact entered into with them, the prophet represents it as if they supplied them with all the necessaries of life. For with their help they tilled their land without fear and in safety traded from country to country." Kimchi quotes at the same time his father's (Joseph Kimchi) interpretation: "But my lord my father of blessed memory explained 'after her lovers' of the sun and moon and stars, which they worshipped; while their intention was that they gave them their food and their sufficiency, as they said, 'But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.'" This exposition of Joseph Kimchi is much nearer the truth than that of his son David; it is, however, too restricted. The "lovers" were the idols on which the people of the northern kingdom so dented, and on which they placed so much dependence. The blessings which they vainly expected from these idols are enumerated: they were - food and raiment and luxuries; the bread and water were the articles of food as it is written elsewhere. "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure;" the wool and flax were the materials for clothing; while the oil and drinks were, the former for ornament, the latter for refresh-merit, and so included all luxuries; thus in <a href="../../par/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> anointest my head with oil;" and in <a href="../../par/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>, "And mingled my drink [literally, 'drinks,' the same word, <span class="accented">shigguyar</span>] with weeping;" also in <a href="../../par/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> we read of "wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthened man's heart." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-6.htm">Hosea 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths</span>. The sudden change of person from the third to the second is very observable. This directness of address is, in this instance, expressive of deep indignation. She had avowed her determination to pursue her evil courses shamefully and sinfully, as if in despite and defiance of the Almighty. In deep and undisguised displeasure, and with a suddenness springing from indignation, he affirms his determination to thwart her course of sin and shame; as though addressing her personally and promptly, he said, "Then thou shalt not be able to carry out thy plan or accomplish thy purpose; I will see to that." The hedge and wall are elsewhere, as in <a href="../../par/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>, used for protection and defense, here for prevention and obstruction, and similarly in <a href="../../par/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>, "He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths;" and in <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>, "He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out," and ver. 9, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked." Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">I</span> will hedge thy way with thorns, so that they cannot go out of the city because of the devastation; and her lovers shall not be able to help her, and they are Assyria and Egypt." After quoting his father's explanation of lovers, he pro-coeds: "So their way is as if there were in it a thorn hedge, and thorns that she could not pass through it, and could not find her paths in which she walked." The fence here is double one a hedge of thorns, sharp, prickly, and piercing, such as forbid her forcing a way through: the other a wall of stone that cannot be climbed, or leaped, or otherwise got over. We need not try to specify the particular circumstances that thus hedged in and walled about the adulteress - whether fightings within or foes beleaguering without, whether straitened means or stress of circumstances raising an impassable barrier against the practice of idolatry, or an enforced conviction of its futility. "<span class="accented">If</span>," says Kimchi, "<span class="accented">she</span> seek to <span class="accented">Assyria</span> and Egypt, they will not give her their friendship and their help."

However eagerly she follows after them - and the form of the verb (Pie! conjugation) expresses that eagerness - she shall only experience the ineffectual nature of her efforts, and feel the impossibility of overtaking the darling objects of her pursuit. However earnestly she seeks them (here the Piel is used again), she shall find every passage barred and every outlet obstructed, so that, unable to find them, she shall be forced to abandon her search as utterly vain and impossible. <span class="cmt_word">Then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</span> The difficulties of her position, the distress in which she found herself, stimulated her to increased eagerness in pursuit of her lovers; but it was only for a brief space, and the efforts were unsuccessful; the means as well as opportunity for the sacrifices and services of idol-worship failed, the obstacles placed in her way were insurmountable. Or, rather, the disappointment was so great and grievous, when all the fondly cherished hopes of help, or succor, or support from those idols were frustrated and found entirely vain, that heartsick and chagrined by unsuccess, she resolves on a change of course. With mingled feelings of remorse and penitence she makes up her mind to retrace her steps. She recalls the better days, the happier time, the more prosperous circumstances, of fidelity to her first and rightful husband and head; and now she is just ready to return to him. She is just now at that stage at which the prodigal in the parable had arrived "when He came to himself," and when he said, "<span class="accented">How</span> many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father." Kimchi remarks," She will not say this until she has borne the captivity a considerable time." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, <i>which</i> they prepared for Baal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For she din not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</span> From vers. 6 to 13 inclusive, the suffering and sorrow consequent on, and occasioned by, her <span class="accented">sins</span> are enumerated; yet now and again certain aggravations of her guilt crop up. Here we have an account of her ignorance of, and ingratitude to, the true and or of her mercies, together with her sinful misuse and sad abuse of those mercies. The products of the earth which God bestowed on her were corn and wine and oil - all that was needed for food, refreshment, and even luxury; the prosperity in trade or commerce with which he favored her resulted in the multiplied increase of silver and gold. The perversion of these blessings consisted in her employment of them in the service of Baal or of idolatry in general. The sin of refusing to acknowledge the Author of such manifold mercies was grievously augmented by this gross abuse of them. The last clause is a relative one, <span class="accented">asher</span>, as frequently being understood; while the words <span class="accented">asu labbaal</span> do not signify that they made those metals into images of Baal, as implied in the Authorized Version; nor vet that they offered them to Baal according to Gesenius; but that they prepared or employed them in the worship of that idol and the service of idolatry in general. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d4;</span>, to cover, multiply, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. multitude and plenty covering ever everything; comp. <span class="accented">tego</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, take possession of the brain in intoxicating: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine. Kimchi remarks as follows: "All the goodness in the possession of which she was, she had not except from me; because I sent my blessing on the corn and wine and oil, and sent my blessing upon the work of their hands, so that they had abundance of silver and gold; but Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-9.htm">Hosea 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax <i>given</i> to cover her nakedness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</span> The abuse of the Divine bounties mentioned in the preceding verse fully justifies the series of punishments that follow. God thus vindicates those penal inflictions. Accordingly he threatens them in this ninth verse with the deprivation of the bounties which they had misused as the means of idolatry and sin; in ver. 10 with disgrace; in ver. 11 with the departure of all her merry-makings; in ver. 12 with the destruction of the sources whence the means of idolatrous worship were supplied; and in ver. 13 with days of visitation proportionate to the time of declension and apostasy. The first clause of the verse under consideration is better rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to the common Hebrew idiom, which employs two verbs to express one idea in a modified sense, the first denoting the manner, and so equivalent to an adverb with us, and the second signifying the matter; and it is thus translated by Keil: "<span class="accented">Therefore</span> will I take back my corn." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We admit the <span class="accented">ray</span> consecutive is opposed to this; and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: and Jerome, "reverter et sumam." The manner of the dispossession intensifies the punishment, just as their abuse of those <span class="accented">possessions</span> had augmented their guilt. The food, refreshment, and raiment are to be taken away this certainly would be bad enough by itself, but the suddenness of the stroke adds poignancy to the infliction. The prospect of an indifferent harvest and of a bad vintage for weeks previously might have prepared them in some sort for the disaster. But when the time of harvest has already come and the season of vintage just arrived, by some sudden, unexpected calamity, whether tempest or hostile invasion, the bread-corn perishes and the wine-grapes are destroyed. The food is thus snatched, as it were, from their month, and the cup dashed from their lips; the sadness of the catastrophe is immensely increased by the sudden rudeness of the stroke by which it comes. Nor is this all. In the case of the raiment, or rather the material, the wool and the flax out of which it is formed, its removal reduces the intended wearer to perfect nudity, or, if we understand it as figure, to abject poverty and absolute penury. Aben Ezra attributes this disaster (ver. 9) to hostile invasion: "At its season when I shall bring the enemies, to take away the corn and the wine;" Kimchi, on the other hand, sees in it a misgrowth: "I will return and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its appointed time, because I will send a curse upon them in the time of harvest and at the season of vintage, instead of the blessing I used to send upon them. And so on all the work of their hands I shall send a curse, and all their gain shall be put into a bag with holes; and they shall not have bread to eat nor raiment to wear."

The figure of a faithless female being continued, the calamities of Israel are pictured in the extreme deplorableness of her condition. The word <span class="accented">navluth</span> does not elsewhere occur, but its meaning is not difficult to ascertain. It denotes literally, "slackness," "laxness," or a withered state, from <span class="accented">navel</span>, to be withered, and may be translated either "her shame" or "her turpitude." The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, while Jerome renders it <span class="accented">stultitiam</span>. Thus she is exposed to the derision and disgust of her former admirers and paramours; while deliverance is out of the question. Her lovers are the idols, or, according to Kimchi," Egypt and Assyria, which cannot deliver her." She who once was the object of delight is become the object of disdain and contempt; nor is there any of her quondam lovers desirous of or able to deliver her out of the hand of him who administers the justly deserved punishment.

"Her new moons" were the monthly celebrations at the commencement of each month. "Her sabbaths" were the weekly solemnities of one day in seven, dedicated to the Lord. Then there is a general summing up of the whole by the addition of "all her solemn feasts," - all her festal days and seasons, including, besides those named, the beginning of the years, the solemn assembly or holy convocation on the seventh day of the Passover and on the eighth day of Tabernacles. Preceding the enumeration is the general <span class="accented">characteristic</span> of all Israel's festivities. They were times of joy, as we read in <a href="../../par/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>, "In the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets;" and in Dent. 12:12 it is expressly declared, "Ye shall rejoice before the Lord... ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates." All this was to cease; the coming captivity would render all such celebrations impossible. Kimchi remarks on this (ver. 11): "For in the distress there is no new moon and no sabbath; and the beginnings of months and sabbaths on which offerings were presented were days of joy. And so with respect to the feast days and solemn assemblies, which were days of rest and quiet joy, they shall not have in them any joy in consequence of the greatness of their distresses." He subsequently adds, "There is a <span class="accented">chag</span> which is not a <span class="accented">raced</span>, but joy wherewith men rejoice and eat and drink; and it is called <span class="accented">chag</span>," referring to Solomon's feast of dedication; "and there is also a <span class="accented">moed</span> which is not a <span class="accented">chag</span>, as for signs and for seasons (<span class="accented">moedim</span>), and at the appointed time I will return unto thee" (<span class="accented">raced</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;</span>, to appoint as time and place).

The vine and fig tree are usually conjoined, and by a common synecdoche convey the idea of all those sources that combine to support life and supply its luxuries. When the united kingdom of Judah and Israel, before the disruption, had obtained the zenith of prosperity in the reign of Solomon, it is thus expressed: Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon." Yet Israel knew not the time of her merciful visitation, and not only turned aside to idols, but most stupidly and most inexcusably attributed the many mercies she enjoyed to the idols which she worshipped. Like a foul adulteress despising the tokens of her husband's affection and delighting in the rewards of lewdness received from licentious paramours, Israel forfeited all her privileges, and forced the Lord to withdraw his bounties and destroy their very source. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, to be bent, from the arch made by its drooping boughs, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5df;</span>, to extend from its length. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> The places where fig trees flourished and vines abounded shall be stripped of those trees, with their pleasant fruits - shall become a forest.

The context, however, militates against the reading in question, for in time of war or general devastation places, through neglect, grow trees and brushwood, where wild beasts lair and lay waste. The explanation of the verse is well given by Kimchi in his commentary: "Because she said, 'These are the hire of my harlotry;' because she said that from the hand of her lovers came the corn and must and oil and all good things; - I will make them a desolation, that she may know whether she had those good things from me or from them. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, because he has compared her to a harlot, he calls those good things <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>; while their signification is identical with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, and their root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> [extend, reach, give], the aleph being prosthetic.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forget me, saith the Lord.</span> The name of Baalim, that is, Baals in the plural, has respect to the various forms of the Baal-idolatry,or modification of the Baal-worship; for example, Baal-peor, Baal-be-rith, Baal-zebub, Baal-perazim, Baal-zephon, Baal-zamar, Baal-shalishu. The name of Baal came to be used generally as the designation of any idol or false god. The days of the Baals were the days consecrated to Baal, and on which the worship of the true God was transferred to that idol. It matters little whether we render "wherein" or "to whom," referring to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, in which case, however, we should expect <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5dd;</span>, though the latter answers better to the meaning of the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>. After mentioning the object of their idolatrous worship, he specifies the manner of it, which was the burning of incense, the part of the process being employed by synecdoche for the whole. Every <span class="accented">mincha</span>, or meat offering, which was presented by itself as a free-will offering was accompanied with frankincense; every day, morning and evening, incense was burnt in the holy place; while on the great Day of Atone-meat the high priest carried a censer of coals from the golden altar into the holiest of all and there burnt incense before the mercy-seat. But the word has often a wider sense than that of burning incense, and is applied to the offering of any sacrifice whatever. Just as the festivals of Jehovah were transferred to Baal, so his service was turned into that of Baal. Titus Israel prostituted herself and acted the part of a spiritual adulteress by her worship of idols. The same unsavory figure is resumed; and her assiduous efforts to worship the idol acceptably and propitiate his favor is presented under the figure of a whorish woman decking herself with meretricious ornaments - nose-rings and jewels, thus making up by artificial means for the lack of natural beauty  - to attract the attention and gain the admiration of her lovers. Thus Aben Ezra: "The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> is metaphorical in allusion to a whorish woman who puts a nose-ring in her nose and a necklace on her neck to make herself beautiful, in order to find favor in the eves of the adulterer." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> has for its verbal root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span>, to overstep the boundary, transgress, plunder, draw to one's self, put on; while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, (masculine <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span>) is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, to rub, polish, be smooth. But when all fails to draw lovers unto her, she casts aside the last remaining fragment of female delicacy, and goes in pursuit of lovers. Thus did Israel. She put Baal or other idols in place of Jehovah; she made a transfer of Jehovah's festivals to Baal; she burnt incense or offered sacrifice to her idol instead of the true God; she went to great pains to secure the acceptance of her false deities; "and <span class="accented">me</span>," says Jehovah very emphatically," <span class="accented">she forgat</span>;" that is, me the true God, her bountiful Benefactor, her gracious Lord. and loving Husband, she forgot. The visitation expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> with accusative of the thing, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> before the person, is commented by Kimchi as follows: "For the transgressions of her (Israel's) iniquity in the exile I will visit upon her the time that she served Baalim; and I will let them remain long in exile for punishment, because they have left my service and served other gods. And even upon children's children shall come this punishment, although they do not serve strange gods in exile; thus is the sentence [literally, 'judgment'] of their punishment, because their children's children shall not be perfect in the service of God and in his commandments in exile, therefore thus shall the iniquity of their fathers who served strange gods unite with their own punishment." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</span> As in vers. 2-5 we have an exposure of Israel's sin, and in vers. 6-13 an enumeration of her sufferings by penal inflictions; so vers. 14-23 contain a touching exhibition of Divine succor and support. The transition is abrupt. Vers. 14-17 exhibit the gradual change wrought in Israel through the progressive means of improvement employed by Jehovah. Israel's future is here reflected in the mirror of her past history. The events of that history are elegantly employed to represent as by type or symbol the mercies in store for Israel, wayward and rebellious though she had proved herself to be. <span class="accented">Laken</span> (from <span class="accented">le</span> causal, and <span class="accented">ken</span>, so, equivalent to "because it is so") at the beginning of this verse (14) is rendered by some, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "but" or "yet;" but its natural signification is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "therefore." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, Ionic <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, neuter <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, contracted <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>); it being so, therefore, and similar to the Latin phrase, <span class="accented">quae cum ita slut</span>, "therefore" implies because Israel can only be turned from her foolish idolatry by the penal measures named. Aben Ezra also understands it here, as elsewhere, in its literal sense; thus: "After she [the unchaste wife representative of Israel] shall know that all this evil has come upon her because that she had forgotten me, and had not known at the beginning that I dealt kindly with her; and when she will say, 'Yet will I go and return to my former husband;' then will I allure her with words." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5ea;&#x5d4;</span> is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5ea;</span> cognate with the Arabic in the sense of "dividing," "being open," "standing open;" thence it signifies "to be susceptible of outward impressions," "allow access and entrance;" in Piel, "to make one open.... be susceptible or inclined," "induce by words." The word <span class="accented">laken</span>, "therefore," has somewhat puzzled commentators, because the connection between the judgments threatened in the preceding verses and the mercies proffered in what follows is not to a superficial view at once apparent. Yet it is mercy and truth meeting together, righteousness and peace kissing each other. It is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the connecting link between the enormity of our sins and the greatness of the Divine mercy; between the vileness of our iniquities and the riches of Divine grace. In like manner the psalmist prays, "Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great;" and God promises by the prophet, "For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners." Long previously God had said, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." The secret of such striking contrasts is that where sin abounded grace did much more abound. Egypt having been to Israel the house of bondage, the exodus from that land represents deliverance out of a servile, suffering condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The wilderness or Arabian desert into which they were brought on leaving that country was a place of <span class="accented">freedom</span>. They were emancipated, and breathed the free air of the wilderness; they were exercised with salutary <span class="accented">discipline</span> after their emancipation; as they traversed the wilderness they were trained and tried. The allurement which prefaces their deliverance refers to the persuasion of Moses and Aaron, who found it necessary to persuade and even coax their countrymen to turn their back on their bondage and follow the leaders whom God had sent them. The "comfortable words" mentioned in the clone of the verse were addressed to them at a subsequent period, when, allured out of the strange land where they had sojourned so long, they were led forth into the wilderness. The "comfortable words" comprehended both temporal and spiritual mercies - relief in every time of emergency, deliverance in danger and distress, a plentiful supply of their necessities, with pardon of their sins, assurances of grace, and renewed tokens of God's favor on repentance. A difficulty has been found in the words, "and bring her into the wilderness," being interposed between the alluring and the speaking comfortably. The difficulty is removed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by translating <span class="accented">vav</span>, not by "and," but by "after," as if equivalent to <span class="accented">acher</span>; thus: "After I shall have brought her into the wilderness I wilt allure and comfort her." Then the meaning would be, "After I have humbled them thoroughly as I did their forefathers in the wilderness, then will I speak comfortably unto them." God humbled their forefathers in Egypt, yet that did not suffice; he humbled them afterwards in the wilderness, and then brought them into Canaan. Many times God sends successive <span class="accented">afflictions</span> upon his own people, to break their hearts, to humble them thoroughly, and at last "he speaks comfortably unto them." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the wilderness may be viewed in another light. Besides the distresses experienced in the wilderness, there were <span class="accented">deliverances</span> enjoyed. The reference here may be to the latter, and all the more as this part of the chapter deals with merciful providences. The particle <span class="accented">vav</span> and other words of the verse then retain their natural sense; and, instead of a denunciation of further afflictions, God declares to Israel that he will perform on their behalf such works of power, wisdom, and goodness, at once great and glorious, merciful and wonderful, as he had wrought for their forefathers in the wilderness after their deliverance from Egypt. Thus the Chaldee: "I will work miracles and great works of wonder for them, such as I wrought in the desert;" as though he said, "Whatever the condition may be into which you shall be brought, vet you shall have me working in as glorious a way for your good and comfort as ever I did for your forefathers when they were in the wilderness." The explanation of "wilderness" under number <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> above, combining, as it does, <span class="accented">deliverance</span> yet <span class="accented">discipline</span>, care yet chastisement, deserves the preference; it is neither to be explained with Keil exclusively in the sense of <span class="accented">promise</span>, nor, on the other hand, exclusively in the sense of <span class="accented">punishment</span> with Rashi, who comments as follows: "I will lead her into the wilderness, which for her is like a wilderness and a dry parched land; and there she shall lay it to heart that it was better with her when she did my will than when she rebelled against me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> The consolations of God are not confined to words; they comprise works as well as words. Friendly doings as well as sayings are embraced in the Divine goodness, and manifest the Divine mercy. On emerging from the wilderness, fruitful vineyards, such as Sibmah, Heshbon, and Elea-leh, east of Jordan. and fertile valleys, like that of Aehor near Jericho, to the west of Jordan, as coon as they have crossed the river, shall be given them. These vineyards and valleys would thus be the first installments of God's promise, and a prelude to the possession of the whole, so <span class="accented">that</span> the door of hopeful expectation and of joyful anticipation would be thrown wide open to them. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> has three meanings - "humble one's self.... answer," "sing." Hence the LXX. and older interpreters adopt <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: Calvin, "respondent;" and Aben Ezra and Kimchi, "she shall sing and play." The last deserves the preference. No wonder if', under such circumstances, Israel responded with songs of praise and thanksgiving, as in that early day of the nation's youth, when, coming up out of Egypt, they sang the song of Moses by the Red Sea's margin, while Miriam and the maidens of Israel in full chorus completed the harmony. Now, all these experiences of the past were to repeat themselves in the future history of Israel. Their past captivity or dispersion was obviously implied in this promised deliverance and God's gracious dealings with them in the future. There is a different explanation of one expression in this verse, which deserves careful consideration - an explanation which turns on what once transpired in that valley, and the meaning of the name of it, <span class="accented">troubling</span>, derived flora that transaction; we refer, of course, to the affair of Achan. The punishment of the transgressor in that case, and the putting away of sin in connection with penitence and prayer, reopened, after defeat, the door of hope, and restored the enjoyment of Divine help. The discomfiture that so troubled the host of Israel was immediately followed by the victory at At, which inspired them with the hope of soon possessing the whole land. So with Israel after the captivity - a dreary night of weeping was followed by a bright and blessed morning. So, too, in time to come, when, after a long and sorrowful expectation, Israel shall return from the lands of their exile to their fatherland, or by faith and repentance to the paternal God, the light of better and more hopeful days shall (lawn upon them. To the idea of troubling Kimchi attaches the notion of <span class="accented">purification</span>, quoting with approval Rashi and Aben Ezra to the same purpose. His comment is: "Because at the beginning, when they went into the land in the days of Joshua, this misadventure befell them, namely, the matter of Achan, he gave them confidence that they should not fear when they assembled in the land, and that no misadventure would occur to them, as they would all be refined and purified because, in the wilderness of the peoples, they would be purified. And that valley of Achor shall no more be called so, for its name is for depreciation; but a name of honor shall be given to it, and it is a door of hope. And inasmuch as he says 'door,' and not 'valley,' as it should be, it is because it shall be to them as a door, since from there they shall enter into the land as they did at the first, and it shall be to them hope and the aim of what is good; consequently they call it the door of hope. And the sage Rabbi Abraham explains the valley of Achor to be the valley of Jezreel, viz.' because I [Jehovah] troubled her there, it will turn to a door of hope.' And R.S.I. (Rashi) of blessed memory explains it as the depth of the exile, where they were troubled; so 'I will give her a door of hope, the beginning of hope, that out of the midst of those troubles I will give her a heart to return to me.'" To the same purpose he quotes a brief comment of Saadia Gaon. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, cognate with Arabic karma, to be noble, equivalent to "the more fruitful and productive." The word <span class="accented">mishsham</span> is, according to some, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> an expression of time, equivalent to "from the time of their departure from the desert," - so Keil; others explain it as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "thereout," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "I will make their vineyards out of it,"  - so Simson; and ethers, again, explain it "from there or thence." It is taken in the last-mentioned sense by Kimchi, as follows: "From the wilderness I will give the whole land, which she formerly possessed, as if he said, 'I will constitute her there in the wilderness to do good to her in her land,' because that in the wilderness of the peoples he will purify them and consume the rebellious and the transgressors, so that the remainder shall fear (or flock reverently to him). Consequently they shall need consolations, and be shall speak to their heart. Because God - blessed be he! - shall give them their land as at the first; therefore he says, 'And I will speak to their heart.' And although we have explained that the consolations shall spring out of the distress which they endured in exile, yet will the whole be as well for the one (viz. the consolation) as for the other (the trouble)." It is aptly remarked by Aben Ezra, in relation to the vineyards, that "the words form a contrast to the other words of the prophet, 'And I will destroy their vine;'" likewise Kimchi asking, "And why has the prophet only mentioned their vineyards (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when purposing to give them the whole land)? Because he had mentioned in their punishment, 'I will destroy her vines,' he mentions in the promised consolation her vineyards."

The divorced wife was to be taken back; the marriage contract, which her shameful adultery had vitiated, was to be renewed, and past offences condoned. This certainly evidenced extraordinary forbearance and affection. But it was not all. A new and higher relationship was to be entered on; so entirely had God forgiven and forgotten, if we may so say, all the multiplied and aggravated transgressions of Israel against him, that that people is not to be received back as a repudiated wife, but to be henceforth regarded and treated as a chaste virgin, and in that capacity betrothed unto the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">And I will betroth thee unto me</span> is the gracious promise thrice repeated, and each time with an additional element of mercy; nor is this betrothal of a temporary character and of short continuance, like the previous marriage compact which the wife's guilt a short time had rendered null and void. It is a durable betrothal, lasting forever. Next to the time during which this betrothal shall continue is the manner in which it is effected, or rather, the basis on which it is established. Justice and judgment present righteousness under two aspects - subjective and objective. <span class="accented">Tsedeq</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">tseda-qah</span>, being right, is subjective righteousness and an attribute of God. <span class="accented">Mishpat</span>, equivalent to objective right, either as executing judgment or as existing in fact Some attribute these characteristics to God and some to Israel, while others to both. Rashi and Kimchi understand both words <span class="accented">tsedeq</span> and <span class="accented">mishpat</span>, subjectively and in relation to the Israelites. The former: "In righteousness and judgment wherein ye shall walk;" the latter: "In righteousness which the Israelites shall practice." Wunsche and Hengstenberg understand the righteousness and judgment of God's doing justice and faithfully fulfilling his covenant obligations to Israel. The latter has well remarked in relation to <span class="accented">mishpat</span> when distinguishing it from <span class="accented">tsedeq</span>, that a man may render what is right to persons and yet not be righteous; that is, there may be objective apart from subjective righteousness. Keil attributes the attributes in question, not only to God fulfilling his covenant engagements to his people, but purifying them through just judgment, and thus providing for their righteousness. That God possesses these is undeniable, but it is equally obvious that he bestows righteousness on his people both by imputation and impartation; he also executes righteousness in their case, purifying them by salutary chastisement, his object being, not only to cleanse, but to keep clean. And yet such is the frailty of man's fallen nature, and so many are the faults and the failings to which he is liable, that loving-kindness (God's condescending love, <span class="accented">chesed</span>, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>) and mercies (inmost compassion on man's weakness, <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) on God's part must be added to righteousness and judgment in order to secure the stability of those whom he takes into covenant, and the continuance of the contract. Nay; for the attainment of the desired end still more is requisite, for, after all his bestowments and all his discipline, and in addition to all his favor and forbearance, his faithfulness (unwavering steadfastness, <span class="accented">emunah</span>, corresponding as the reverse side to and securing the <span class="accented">leolam</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> indispensable to Israel's perseverance; and thus, notwithstanding Israel's failures, Jehovah's faithfulness guarantees ultimate and lasting success. The special quality on Israel's side is true knowledge of God.

The corn and wine and oil appeal, by a graphic personification, to mother earth; earth appeals to the over-canopying heavens; and the heavens appeal to him whose throne is in the heavens, but whom the heavens and heaven of heavens cannot contain. Soon the floating cloud is seen and the falling rain is heard; the parched earth drinks in the moisture; and its products, being nourished and refreshed, supply to the utmost the wants and wishes of Jezreel. Kimchi comments on this picture as follows: "He says that then, in the season of salvation, the heavens shall give their dew, and the earth shall give her increase. And he says, 'I will tear the heavens which were shut up when they were in the land, as in the days of Ahab; on their return to the land at the time of salvation they shall no more be shut.' And he says, 'I will answer,' as if the heavens asked that they might give rain according to their manner, and I will answer; [as if] their earth [asked] that they [the heavens] might give rain after their manner, even showers of blessing. And this ' I will answer' denotes that my favor shall be on them [the heavens]. 'And they shall answer the earth,' as if the earth asked rain and longed for it. 'And the earth shall hear when it shall give its increase, and the tree of the field shall give its fruit...' 'And they shall hear Jezreel,' for in the multiplying of good things the eaters thereof multiply, for the steppes shall be full of the sheep of Israel. In the punishments he called the name of Israel Jezreel, because they were scattered among the nations. In the time of salvation he likewise calls them Jezreel, because they were sown in their land; accordingly, he says afterwards, 'I will sow them to me in the land.'" Such is the prophet's pictorial representation of a prosperity including food in abundance, refreshment limited by moderation, and even luxuries without stint. Old things are passed away; sinful things have ceased; there is a complete reversal of the sorrowful circumstances into which sin had plunged Israel. God's scattering has now become God's sowing. "I sow her" is the remark of Aben Ezra, "that they may multiply and be fruitful as the seed of the earth."

Such is the love of the Lord towards Israel; but they turn aside to the idols of the nations." The word <span class="accented">mr</span> is in contrast with '<span class="accented">techillath</span>, as the second part of Jehovah's continued discourse. It is erroneously and, contrary to the accents, constructed with "said" by Kimchi and others (Ewald considers it admissible, Umbreit preferable). Kimchi's comment on this verse is: "After the prophet finished his words of consolation, he returns to words of censure, turning to the men of his own time. And it is the custom of the prophets to intermingle reproofs with consolations in their discourses. But he says <span class="accented">yet</span> (again), because he had already commanded him to marry a wife of whoredoms, and now he speaks to him another parable." This time he does not employ the ordinary and usual word "take," but "love." plainly implying that he had already married her, so that her unfaithfulness took place in wedlock; or rather indicating the object of the union. <span class="cmt_word">Beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress</span>. Her friend or companion is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her lawful husband, but contemporaneously and continuously with her husband's love to her are her adulteries with others, as is implied by the participles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;</span>, being indefinite as not having article or suffix, is understood by some to be an acquaintance or lover, and preferred, as a milder term, to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>. The contrast was realized in Jehovah's love for Israel, notwithstanding their spiritual adultery in worshipping other gods. <span class="cmt_word">According to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel who look</span> (turn) <span class="cmt_word">to other gods</span>. Two expressions in this clause recall, if they do not actually reflect, the words of two older Scriptures; thus in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a> we read, "Because the Lord loved you;" and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-18.htm">Deuteronomy 31:18</a>, "They are turned unto ether gods." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And love flagons of wine</span> (margin, <span class="accented">grapes</span>). The term <span class="accented">ashishe</span>, according to Rashi and Aben Ezra, means "bowls," that is, "bowls of wine" (literally, "of grapes"). They probably connected the word with the root <span class="accented">shesh</span>, six, a sextorius, and hence any other wine-vessel. The Septuagint, however, renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "cakes with dried grapes." This meaning is to be preferred, whether we derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to press together, or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire; according to the former and correct derivation, the sense being cakes of grapes pressed together; according to the latter, cakes baked with fire. Gesenius differentiates the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, dried grapes, but not pressed together into a cake, and from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, figs pressed together into a cake. These raisin-cakes were regarded as luxuries and used as delicacies; hence a fondness for such indicated a proneness to sensual indulgence, and figuratively the sensuous service belonging to idol-worship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">So I bought her to me for fifteen <i>pieces</i> of silver, and <i>for</i> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I bought</span> (<span class="accented">acquired</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley and an half-homer</span> (margin, <span class="accented">lethech</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of barley</span>. In narrating the prophet's compliance with the Divine command, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span>is connected by Aben Ezra with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in the sense of making acquaintance with; but it is more correctly referred by Kimchi to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> with daghesh euphonic in the <span class="accented">caph</span> as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> shall meet thee. "The daghesh of the <span class="accented">caph</span> is for euphony as in <span class="accented">miqdush</span>, and the root is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (Kimchi). The meaning is then simply and naturally traced as follows: to dig, obtain by digging, acquire. The price paid for the acquisition in this case was either the purchase money paid to the parents of the bride, as to Laban in the case of Rachel and Leah by Jacob, or the marriage present paid (<span class="accented">mohar</span>) to the bride herself. Another view represents the prophet paying the price to the woman's husband to whom she had been unfaithful, and who in consequence resigned her for so small a sum. It remains for us to attend to the amount thus paid. Fifteen pieces of silver or shekels would be about one pound fifteen shillings, or one pound seventeen and six-pence; while the price of the barley would he somewhere about the same. There were fifty or sixty shekels in a <span class="accented">mana</span>, Greek <span class="accented">mina</span>, and Latin <span class="accented">ulna</span>; while the maneh was cue-sixtieth of a talent (<span class="accented">kikteer</span>); and thus three thousand or three thousand six hundred shekels in a talent. The homer, the largest of the Hebrew dry measures, contained one cor or ten ephahs (  =   ten baths of liquids   =   ten Attic <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and the half-homer or <span class="accented">lethec</span> (<span class="accented">haemi-coros</span> in LXX.) was half a cop or five ephahs. These fifteen ephahs, at a shekel each - for under extraordinary circumstances (<a href="../../par/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>) we read of" two measures of barley for a shekel" - would be equivalent to one pound fifteen or seventeen shillings and sixpence. Both together  - the silver and the barley - would amount to thirty shekels, or three pounds and ten or fifteen shillings. Why this exact amount? and why such particularity in the reckoning? By turning to <a href="../../par/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a> we learn that thirty shekels were the estimated value of a manservant or maidservant; for it is there stated that "if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver." The price paid by the prophet partly in money and partly in kind was exactly the price of an ordinary maidservant. The barley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, plural, equivalent to "grains of barley") may hint the woman's unchastity, as it was the offering for a woman suspected of adultery (<a href="../../par/numbers/5.htm">Numbers 5</a>.) The low estate of the person purchased is a legitimate inference kern all this. The wife, for whom such a paltry sum should be paid, and paid in such a way, or to whom such a petty gift would be offered, must be supposed to be in a condition of deep depression or in circumstances of great distress. Thus the sum paid by the prophet for his partner symbolizes the servile state of Israel when Jehovah chose them for his peculiar people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/3-3.htm">Hosea 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <i>another</i> man: so <i>will</i> I also <i>be</i> for thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shall not be for another man.</span> The prophet imposes certain restrictions of a very stringent character on his wife; he places her in a state of isolation; her past excesses and his purpose of effecting her reformation necessitate such measures, however strict and severe or even harsh they may appear. She is not to be admitted into full fellowship with her husband, nor is she to be allowed the possibility of intercourse with others. From friend, that is, husband and lovers, she is shut out; all sexual connection, whether illicit or legitimate, is peremptorily cut off. The clause, "thou shalt abide [or, 'sit still'] for me," denotes an attitude of waiting, not necessarily in sorrow, like the captive maiden who before marriage with her captor bewailed her parents for the period of a month, but in patient expectation of her husband's fortune and favor, though in seclusion from him, as also exclusion of all others. During this long period of "many days" she is not only debarred the society of her lawful partner, but forbidden either to play the harlot with several or to attach herself to a single paramour. Jerome directs attention to the fact that the word "another" has no place in the original text; otherwise it would imply that she was prohibited from intercourse with any other than her husband, while the real meaning makes the prohibition absolute and inclusive even of conjugal connection with her husband. <span class="cmt_word">So will I also be for thee</span>. The Hebrew expositors, Aben Ezra and Kimchi, repeat the negative flora the preceding clause and translate, "Nor shall I even come to you," that is, for marital society. This is not necessary to bring out the true sense, which is that, as she was to be restrained from intercourse with any and every other man, so he himself also would abstain from intercourse with her. "<span class="accented">And</span> also I will be for [unto] thee [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy husband] to preserve conjugal fidelity to thee, but hold aloof from thee during thy detention." Thus separated from both lovers and husband, Israel would for many a long day suspend her worship of idols, and be at the same time shut out from her covenant relation to Jehovah. Kimchi's comment mounts to pretty much the same, as does also that of Aben Ezra. The explanation of the former is, "I said to her, After thou hast committed adultery against me, thy punishment shall be that thou shalt abide in widowhood of life many days; and the meaning of 'for me' is, thou shalt be called by my name and not by another man's; thou shalt say, I am the wife of such a one, and thou shelf not play the harlot with others, and also thou shalt not be the wife of any other man than myself." Aben Ezra makes mention of another interpretation of the verse, to the effect, "If ye shall return to me, I also will return to you." With this the Chaldee Targum is in accord, which represents God as commanding the prophet to say, "O congregation of Israel, your sins have been the cause of your exile for many days; ye shall devote yourselves to my service, and not go astray nor worship idols, and I also will have compassion upon you." Maurer considers the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, viz. <span class="accented">remhabere cum muliere</span>; but to this linguistic usage is opposed. Umbreit renders the phrase, "and I will <span class="accented">only</span> be for thee;" this, however, partakes more of the nature of a promise than of a punishment, and is not quite, therefore, in accord with the context. Ewald: "And yet I am kind to thee [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. love thee];" this is a rather trivial, as also ill-supported idea. Calvin's exposition is pretty much the same as we have given, and is the following: "I also shall be for thee; that is, I pledge my faith to thee, or I subscribe myself as thy husband: but another time must be looked for; I yet defer my favor, and suspend it until thou givest proof of true repentance. I also shall be for thee; that is, thou shalt not be a widow in vain; if thou complainest that wrong is done to thee, because I forbid thee to marry any one else, I also bind myself in turn to thee." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and <i>without</i> teraphim:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and teraphim</span>. For a long series of years they were thus doomed to be without civil polity, or ecclesiastical privilege, or prophetic intimations. More particularly they were to remain without royal rule, or princely power, or priestly function, or prophetic instruction. As the prophet's wife was neither to be, strictly speaking, her husband's nor yet belong to another man; so Israel, as represented by her, was destined to be deprived of independent self-government and princely sovereignty; of Divine service, whether allowed as by sacrifice - the central part of Hebrew worship - or disallowed as by statue; of oracular responses, whether lawful as by the ephod or unlawful as by teraphim. There was thus an entire breaking up of Church and state as they had long existed; of all civil and ecclesiastical relations and privileges as they had been long enjoyed. Without a king of their own nationality to sit upon the throne, or a prince of their own race as heir apparent to the kingdom, or princes as the great officers of state; without offering by sacrifice to Jehovah, or statue by way of memorial to Baal; without means of ascertaining the will of Heaven in relation to the future by the Urim and Thummim of the high-priestly ephod, only the more than questionable means of soothsaying by the teraphim; - the children of Israel were to be left. And what attaches special importance to this remarkable passage is the undeniable tact that these predictions were uttered, not only before the dissolution of the monarchy and the cessation of sacrifices, but at a time when no human sagacity could foresee and no human power foretell the future abstention of the Hebrew race from idol-worship so long practiced, and from heathenish divination resorted to from such an early period of their history. Rashi, in his comment, has the following: "I said to her, Many days shalt thou abide for me; thou shalt not go a-whoring after other gods; for if thou shalt play the harlot, thy sons shall remain many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice in the sanctuary in Judah, and without a statue of Baal in Samaria of the kings of Israel, and without an ephod with Urim and Thummim which declared to them secrets, and without teraphim; they are images that are made with the observation of one hour composed for the purpose, and which speak of themselves and declare secrets; and so Jonathan has translated, "Neither will there be an ephod nor one to give a response.'" Similarly Aben Ezra: "Without king, nor is there any objection from the Chasmoneans, for they were not of the children of Judah...  without sacrifice to Jehovah nor statue to Baal, without ephod to Jehovah and without teraphim to the worshippers of idols, which Laban called his gods." It is a matter of much consequence that some of the ablest of the Jewish expositors realize these predictions as applicable to their own case and the existing circumstances of their nation. Thus Kimchi, in commenting on this verse, says, "These are the days of the exile in which we are this day, and we have neither king nor prince of Israel, for we are in the power of the Gentiles, and in the power of their kings and princes...  no sacrifice to God and no statue for worshippers of idols...  and no ephod which shall declare future things by Urim and Thummim, and no teraphim for idolaters which declare the future according to the notion of those who believe in them; and thus we are this day in this exile, all the children of Israel;" he then cites the Targum of Jonathan in confirmation of his sentiments. For the ephod, comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-14</a>, from which we learn that it was "a short cloak, covering shoulders and breast, wrought with colors and gold, formed of two halves connected by two shoulder-pieces, on each of which was an onyx engraved with six names of tribes, and held together round the waist by a girdle of the same material;" it was part of the high priest's attire. The teraphim - from the Arabic <span class="accented">tarifa</span>, to live comfortably, and <span class="accented">turfator</span>, a comfortable life, were the household gods and domestic oracles, like the Roman penates, and deriving the name from being thought the givers and guardians of a comfortable life, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>. They were images in human form and stature, either graven of wood or stone (<span class="accented">pesel</span>), or molten out of precious metal (<span class="accented">mas-sekhah</span>). The first mention of them is in <a href="../../par/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>, and the name occurs fifteen times in the Old Testament. They appear to have been of Syrian or Chaldean origin. Aben Ezra says of them, "What appears to me most probable is that they had a human form and were made for the purpose of receiving supernal power, nor can I explain it further." The two principal species of offerings were the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d1;&#x5d7;</span>, or bloody sacrifice, and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>, or unbloody oblation. The former comprehended those entirely burnt on the altar, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, to ascend, from going up entirely in the altar-smoke; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d1;</span>, or those of which only the fat was burnt. According to the object of the offerer, they were <span class="accented">chattah</span>, sin offering, pointing to expiation or pardon for something done demanding punishment; or <span class="accented">asham</span>, trespass offering, implying satisfaction and acceptance, or something undone demanding amends; and <span class="accented">shelamim</span>, peace offerings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord theft God, and David their king.</span> The note of time in the beginning of ver. 5 is explained by Rashi to signify "after the days of the Captivity;" and by Kimchi as follows: "This will take place at the end of the days, near the time of salvation, when the children of Israel shall return in repentance." Though not comprehended in the symbolic representation that precedes, this statement is necessary to complete it. The future of Israel is the burden of this promise; the blessedness of that future is its brightness. It comprises three items - the reversal of their previous career, their loving return to the Lord their God, and their cordial reception of David their king. Contemporaneous with their sorrow for the sins of the past was their serious seeking of the Lord their God and submission to David their king. Their revolt from the Davidic dynasty in the days of Rehoboam was immediately followed by the idolatry of the calves which Jeroboam set up at Dan and Bethel. The reversal of this course is symptomatic of their complete recovery. The patriarch David was long dead and buried, and his sepulcher was in Palestine at the time when the prophet wrote; one, therefore, in the Davidic line, a descendant from, and dynastic representative of, the patriarch must be meant. That this was Messiah there can be no reasonable doubt; parallel passages in the other prophets prove this; for example: "I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 25</a>; comp. also Ezekiel 37:24). Again in Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>) we read to the same purpose, "They shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them." We can by no means concur with those who refer this promise to Zerubbabel as a later occupant of the Davidic throne; and just as little with those who, like Wunsche, hold that the prophet has no particular period and no particular person in view, but presents the prospect of a happy and blissful future when Israel would return to the pure worship of Jehovah and enjoy his gracious protection, and when the national prosperity would equal or even far <span class="accented">surpass</span> that under the glorious reign of David <span class="accented">himself.</span> The best Jewish authorities are quoted in favor of the same; thus Rabbi Tanchum says, "He (the prophet) understands the son of David, occupying his place, from his lineage, walking in his way, by whom his name shall endure and his kingdom be preserved." The Chaldee Targum translates in the same sense: "<span class="accented">They</span> shall seek the worship of Jehovah their God, and obey Messiah, the Son of David, their king." So Aben Ezra <span class="accented">says</span> that "David their king is this Messiah, Like 'My servant David shall be their prince forever' (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>)." The well-known idiom of one idea expressed by two verbs, so that the rendering of the clause would be "They shall again seek the Lord their God, and David their king," if applied here, as undoubtedly it might, would weaken the sense, and so be unsuitable to the context. <span class="cmt_word">And shall fear</span> (literally, <span class="accented">come with trembling to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.</span> The comment of Kimchi on the first part of this clause is as follows: "They shall tremble and be afraid of him when they return to him, and shall with repentance wait for the goodness of redemption on which they have trusted." A somewhat different meaning is assigned to the words by Aben Ezra: "They shall return in haste, when the end (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the time of redemption) comes to their own land with hasty course suddenly." <span class="accented">His goodness</span> is taken by some in a concrete sense, as signifying the blessings which he bestows and the good gifts which he imparts; and by others in the abstract, as the Divine goodness or majesty, to which Israel resorts for the pardon of sin and the gracious acceptance of their petitions and answer of their prayers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hosea/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hosea 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hosea/4.htm"><title>Hosea 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hosea/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hosea/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hosea/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hosea/3.htm" title="Hosea 3">&#9668;</a> Hosea 4 <a href="../hosea/5.htm" title="Hosea 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because <i>there is</i> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - A new and distinct division of the book commences with this fourth chapter and continues till the close. What had previously been presented in figure and symbol is now plainly and literally stated. The children of Israel are summoned in the first verse of this chapter to hear the charge preferred against them and the sentence pronounced. Having convened, as it were, a public assembly and cited the persons concerned, the prophet proceeds to show cause why they are bound to give an attentive hearing. In God's controversy with the people of the land the prophet acts as his ambassador, accusing the people of great and grievous sins, and vindicating the justice of God's judgments in their punishment. The <span class="accented">ki</span> with which the last clause of the verse commences may be either causal or recitative, and may thus specify either the ground or subject of controversy. It is commonly understood here in the former sense. Israel is charged with want of truth, mercy, and the knowledge of God. Kimchi comments on this controversy as follows: "<span class="accented">With</span> the inhabitants of the land of Israel I have a controversy, for I gave them the land on the condition that they should exercise righteousness and judgment, and on this condition I pledged myself to them that my eyes would be upon them from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. But since they practice the opposite  - cursing, lying, etc. - I also will act with them in a way contrary to what I assured them, and will hide my face from them." He adds, "There were some righteous among them, but they were few, and they hid themselves from the face of the multitude who were wicked." Truth and mercy are at once Divine attributes and human virtues; it is in the latter sense, of course, that they are here employed. Truth includes works as well as words, doing as well as saying; it implies uprightness in speech and behavior - thorough integrity of character and conduct, Mercy goes beyond and supplements this. We sometimes say of such a one that he is an honest but a hard man. Mercy combined with truth, on the contrary, makes a man kind as well as honest, benevolent as well as upright. In a somewhat similar sense the apostle conjoins goodness and righteousness when he says, "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die." The knowledge of God is the real root of these two virtues of truth and mercy. If we know God as he is in himself and as he stands in his relations to us, we shall conform our conduct to his character and our actions to his will. If we know God to be a God of truth, who delighteth in truth in the inward parts, we shall cultivate truth in our hearts, express it with our lips, and practice it in our lives. If we know God as a God of mercy, who has shown such boundless mercy to us in pardoning our multiplied and aggravated offences, we shall imitate that mercy in our relations to our fellow-man; nor shall we enact the part of the merciless man in the parable, who owed his lord ten thousand talents, and who, having nothing to pay, was freely forgiven the debt; but finding his fellow-servant, who owed him only an hundred pence, laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, "Pay me that thou owest," and, deaf to that fellow-servant's supplications, east him into prison till he should pay the debt. The intimate connection of the knowledge of God with the virtues in question is confirmed by the Prophet Jeremiah, "<span class="accented">Did</span> not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? he judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me, saith the Lord?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Having given a picture of Israel negatively, he next presents the positive side. The absence of the virtues specified implies the presence of the opposite vices. In the most vivid and impressive manner the prophet, instead of enumerating prosaically the vices so prevalent at the time, expresses them more emphatically by a species of exclamation, using <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> infinitives absolute instead of finite verbs; thus: "Swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery." They may, however, be regarded as in the nominative as subjects to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. Instead of either supplying <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, to allot, or closely connecting" allot" with the verb "to lie," which immediately follows, it is better to understand the two verbs separately, as expressing two different species of sin; that is, swearing and cursing, and lying.  So the Septuagint renders them by the nouns <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">cursing</span> and lying;" as also the Chaldee, "<span class="accented">they</span> swear falsely and lie." The commandments which the children of Israel thus violated were the third, the ninth, the sixth, the eighth, and the seventh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The construction, adopted in the LXX., Vulgate, and by Luther in his version, takes the infinitives (nounal expressions of habitual or continued actions) as nominatives to the verb <span class="accented">paratsu</span>; thus: "<span class="accented">Cursing</span>, and lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in the land;" "Maledictum, et mendacium, et homicidium, et furtum, et adulterium innndavernut;" and Luther translates, "Gotteslastern, Luger, Morder, Stehlen, and Ehebrechen hat uberhand genommen." The common mode <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of constructing the infinitives independently as above in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> or gerundively as in the Authorized Version, and in either ease understanding an indefinite subject to <span class="accented">paratsu</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> preferable on the whole; thus: "By swearing, etc., they break out." The allusion to the water overflowing its banks and spreading in all directions, implied in the Septuagint Version, is approved by Jerome in his Commentary: "He (the prophet) did not say <span class="accented">est</span>, but, to demonstrate the abundance of crimes, introduced <span class="accented">inundaverunt</span> (overflowed)." The common meaning of <span class="accented">parats</span> is to tear or break - break in upon, especially with violence, as robbers and murderers; <span class="accented">so paritsim</span> has the sense of murderers and robbers. It is better, therefore, to take the verb here as a present perfect connecting past and present, and to translate it" break through," or" in to," that is, as burglars into houses. So Kimchi, though figuratively: "They break through the wall which is the fence of the Law, and multiply transgressions." Similarly, De Wette has "Gewaltthat uber sie;" and Maurer likewise: "Jurare et mentiri et occidere et furari et adulterari! <span class="accented">Violenter agunt</span> et sanguines sanguines altingunt." The Massoretic accentuation favors (putting <span class="accented">athnach</span> at <span class="accented">naopt</span>) this construction; while the context, which speaks of bloodshed, is quite in keeping with acts of violence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - These verses relate, with much particularity, the sufferings consequent on sins, especially such as are specified in the preceding verses. <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">montaging of the land</span> mentioned in ver. 3 may be understood either figuratively or literally. If in the former way, there are many Scripture parallels which represent nature in full accord with human feelings, sympathizing with man, now in joy, again in sorrow; for example: "The little hills rejoice on every side;" the valleys "shout for joy, they also sing;" on the other hand, "The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish." But if the expression be taken literally, it conveys a solemn fact, and one in perfect harmony with the entire tone and character of the old economy, according to which moral evil transmutes itself into physical evil, and impresses itself in dismal characters on the face of inanimate nature. The Hebrew commentators seem to understand the statement literally; thus Rashi: "The land shall be laid waste, and there shall be great mourning;" likewise Kimchi: "The land of Israel shall be laid waste and desolated." The latter has this further comment: "After the land of Israel shall have been laid waste, man and beast shall be cut off out of it. But under the beasts of the field the prophet does not mean the wild beasts, but the large domestic animals which dwell with the sons of men, likewise called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>. It is also possible that even the beasts that roam at largo are included, for the wild beast does not come to inhabited places that are laid waste, unless they are partially inhabited." He also adds, in reference to the fowls of heaven, "When he speaks of the fowls of heaven, it is because most of the fowls do not dwell in the wilderness, but in inhabited places, where they find seeds and fruits and blossoms of trees. Or the fowls of heaven are mentioned by way of hyperbole to represent the matter in its totality; and, according to this sense, it is used in the Prophet Jeremiah; and it explains itself in like manner in one of these two ways." With the mourning of the land the dwellers therein languish. Nor is this languishing condition confined to rational beings; it comprises the irrational as well, and that without exception. The dominion assigned man at the beginning over the whole creation of God is here reversed in the case of Israel; while the denunciation of wrath has that reversal for its dark background. The terms of the dominion to man by the Creator are, "Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth;" but in this denunciation these terms are reversed and read backwards, being," with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also." Thus all nature, inanimate and animate, and all creation, rational and irrational, are involved in the consequences of Israel's sin. The particles "yea, even," preceding "the fishes of the sea" (such as the Sea of Galilee or other inland seas and rivers), show the entirely unexpected as well as unusual nature of the event. The Chaldee paraphrases the clause as follows: "And even the fishes of the sea shall be diminished in number, on account of their (Israel's) sins." Earth refuses sustenance to man and beast, no longer yielding grass for the cattle or herb for the service of man; the waters of the sea, being lessened by drought or becoming putrid by stagnation, no longer supply their accustomed quota of fishes for human food. An illustration of the literal sense has been quoted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Pusey from Jerome. It is the following: "Whoso believeth not that this befell the people of Israel, let him survey Illyricum, let him survey the Thraces, Macedonia, the Pannonias, and the whole land which stretches from the Propoutis and Dosphorus to the Julian Alps, and he will experience that, together with man, all the creatures also fail, which afore were nourished by the Creator for the service of man." The <span class="accented">le</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>is explained by Abarbanel in the sense of <span class="accented">through</span>, as though the inhabitants would be slain by wild beasts: by Hitzig as <span class="accented">extending to</span>; by Keil as <span class="accented">of</span> in enumeration. It is simply <span class="accented">with</span>. Ver. 4 looks like an interjected clause, coming in the middle of the enumeration of Divine judgments; and the purpose is not so much to justify the severity of those judgments as to intimate their inefficacy, owing to the incorrigible character of the people. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering of the Authorized Version, Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another. This seems to show that mutual reproof was out of place, since one was as bad as another; or that every one was to look to his own sins, and not throw the blame on others; but this rendering is not tenable nor capable of being supported by such an expression as <span class="accented">ish beish</span>. The correct rendering <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is rather, <span class="accented">only let no man strive</span> (<span class="accented">with them</span>), <span class="accented">and let no man reprove them</span>. This imports <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that reasoning with them would be useless, and reproof thrown away, in consequence of the desperate obstinacy of these offenders; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that they were so self-willed that they would not allow any one to reprove them for their conduct. The rendering <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is favored by Kimchi: "Let a man not strive, nor reprove his fellow for his wickedness, for it profits him not, because he also does evil like him." The fact often experienced in a season of public calamity, that every one comes forth as a correcter of morals, and transfers to his neighbor the cause of such calamity, Hitzig illustrates by the following words of Curtius: "Quod in adversis rebus fieri solet, alius in allure culpam transferebat." The explanation (2, b), which is pretty much that of Ewald, is supported by the comments of Rashi and Aben Ezra. The former explains: "Ye warn the true prophets against striving with you and against reproving you;" the latter: "There is no one that strives with another or reproves him: and yet it was the right of the priest to reprove Israel; but now they turn to reprove the priest, for he also is wicked in his works." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Pusey's rendering, though only a slight modification of the preceding, conveys a different sense. It is "Only men let him not strive, and let not man reprove," which he explains as follows: "God had taken the controversy with his people into his own hands; the Lord, he said (ver. 1), had a controversy (<span class="accented">rib</span>) with the inhabitants of the land. Here he forbids man to intermeddle; man let him not strive (he again uses the same word). The people were obstinate and would not hear... so God bids man to cease to speak in his Name. He himself alone will implead them, whose pleading none could evade or contradict." The rendering <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is, in our opinion, decidedly entitled to the preference both on the ground of simplicity and agreement with the following clause. That clause, for thy people are as they that strive with the priest, is thought by Abarbanel to allude to the opposition of Korah and his company to Aaron the high priest, as recorded in <a href="../../par/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, and referred to in <a href="../../par/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>. In the former passage, at the eleventh verse, it is asked, "And what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?" while in the latter, at ver. 16, we read the statement: "They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord." This allusion, by which the Israelites of the prophet's day were compared to the  Korathires, will appear to most as far-fetched. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The usual acceptation is both simpler and more satisfactory. It takes the expression to denote such contumacy as is reproved in <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>, "The man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel." The contumaciousness of Israel is thus compared to that of persons who were so obstinate and presumptuous as neither to obey nor reverence, but rather rebel against, the true priests of Jehovah, who, in his Divine Name and by Divine authority, instructed or reproved. Such persons neither feared God nor regarded man. It was the refractoriness of pupils acting in opposition to their teacher, or of a people rising in rebellion against their spiritual instructors. Thus the Chaldee understands it: "And thy people contend [quarrel] with their teachers." The last clause of ver. 4 is fairly well explained by Kimchi (except that he explains <span class="accented">kaph</span> of certainty and not similitude) as follows: "The prophet says, The priest should have taught, striven with, and reproved the people; but at this time the people strive with the priest; for it is not enough that they do not receive his reproof, but they strive with and reprove him, after the way they say, 'A generation that judges its judges.' Or the explanation is, 'The priest is as wicked as they, and if he reproves them so also they reprove him.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, as a priest spoken against. The text being thus somewhat doubtful, Michaelis made a very slight change in the pointing, putting a <span class="accented">patach</span> instead of <span class="accented">tsere</span> in the word for "contend;" thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, so that the translation would be, "And thy people are as my adversaries (those who contend with me), O priest." The people that should have learnt the Law from the lips of the priest would not even submit to reproof from the Most High himself. The expression, "priest-disputers" or "priest-gainsayers," is admittedly an unusual one, and given as a specimen of the peculiarities of this prophet's style, to which, however, there is a parallel in "boundary-movers" (cf. <a href="http://bible.cc/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>). Still, we see no real advantage gained by the conjectural emendation of Michaelis, though some are disposed to accept it on the ground that the representation of the incorrigibleness of a people by gainsaying opposition to the priest appears incongruous with the immediately succeeding denunciation of the priesthood. The objection is obviated by understanding, as above, opposition to the true priests of the Lord. Another conjectural reading is that of Beck, via <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, equivalent to "and my people are like their priests." Such conjectural emendation is needless as useless.

Instead of saying that the people would fall (literally, <span class="accented">stumble</span>) in the day, and the prophet with them in the night, the meaning of the sentence, divested of its peculiar form of parallelism, is that people and prophet alike would fall together, at all times, both by day and by night, that is to say, there would be no time free from the coming calamities; and there would be no possibility of escape, either for the sinful people or their unfaithful priests; the darkness of the night would not hide them, the light of the day would not aid them; destruction was the doom of priests and people, inevitable and at all times. <span class="cmt_word">And I will destroy thy mother</span>. Their mother was the whole nation as such - the kingdom of Israel. The expression is somewhat contemptuous, as though he said of the individual members that they were truly their mother's children - resembling her erewhile in sin and soon in sorrow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Though the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> is seldom used in Qal to denote "likeness," Abarbanel, as quoted by Rosenm&uuml;ller, translates, "I have been like thy mother," and explains of the people addressing priest and prophet as a mother reproving her petulant children in order to improve them. Besides the far-fetched nature of such a rendering, there is the formidable grammatical objection that, in the sense of "similitude," this verb requires to be constructed with <span class="accented">le</span> or el. so that it should be <span class="accented">le immeka</span> or <span class="accented">el immeka</span>. "This word, when derived from <span class="accented">demuth</span>, likewise has el with <span class="accented">seghol</span> after it; but without el, it has the meaning of destroy," is the statement of Aben Ezra. The LXX., assigning to the verb the sense of "similarity," renders the phrase by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "I have compared thy mother to night." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome, connecting the verb with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, understands it in the sense of "silence:" "I have made thy mother silent in the night; that is, "Israel is delivered up in the dark night of captivity, sorrow, and overwhelming distress." The Syriac likewise has: "And thy mother has become silent" (if <span class="accented">shathketh</span> be read). The Chaldee, though more periphrastic, brings out nearly the same sense: "I will overspread your assembly with stupefaction." To the same purport is the exposition of Rashi: "My people shall be stupefied as a man who sits and is overwhelmed with stupor, so that no answer is heard from his mouth." The meaning "destroy" is well supported by the cognate Arabic, and gives a good sense; thus Gesenius renders: "I destroy thy mother, that is, lay waste thy country." Rather, the nation, collectively, is the mother; while the members individually are the children. Nor shall private persons escape in the public catastrophe - root and branch are to perish. Kimchi's comment on <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is: "I will cut off the whole congregation, so that no congregation shall remain in Israel; for they shall be scattered in the exile, the one here, the other there." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.</span> Here the verb is plural and its subject singular, because, being collective, it comprehends all the individual members of the nation. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by Jerome in the sense of "silence:" "conticuit populus incus," which he explains to mean "sinking into eternal silence." So also the Chaldee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX., understands it in the sense of "likeness:" "My people are like (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) as if they had no knowledge." Aben Ezra disproves this sense as follows: "This word, if it were from the root signifying 'likeness,' would have after it <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">seghol</span>, as, 'To [<span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">seghol</span>] whom art thou like in thy greatness?' (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a>); but without the word <span class="accented">el</span> it has the meaning of ' cutting off.'" So Kimchi: "Here also it has the sense of  'cutting off.'" The article before "knowledge" implies renewed mention and refers to the word in ver. 1; or it may emphasize the word as that knowledge by way of eminence, which surpasses all other knowledge, and without which no other knowledge can really prove a blessing in the end. The knowledge of God is the most excellent of all sciences. Paul counted all things but loss in comparison with its possession; and our blessed Lord himself says, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;" while the Prophet Isaiah attributed the captivity to its absence: "My people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast rejected knowledge... seeing thou hast forgotten the Law of thy Son.</span> The cause of this ignorance is here charged on the unfaithfulness of the priesthood. They rejected knowledge and forgot the Law of their God. The two concluding clauses of this verse may be regarded as "split members" of a single sentence. As rejection implies the presence of the object rejected, while forgetfulness implies its absence from the mind or memory, some have understood rejection of knowledge as the sin of the priest, and forgetfulness that of the people. This separation is not necessary, for what men continue for a time to despise they will by-and-by forget. The forgetfulness is thus an advance upon rejection. The sin of these priests was very great, for, while the priests' lips were required to keep knowledge, they neither preserved that knowledge themselves nor promoted it among the people; hence the indignant and direct address. Thus Kimchi says: "He addresses the priestly order that existed at that time: Thou hast rejected he knowledge for thyself and to teach it to the people, consequently I will reject thee from being a priest unto me. Since thou dost not exercise the office of priest, which is to teach the Law, I will reject thee so that thou shalt not be a priest in my house." <span class="cmt_word">I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me... I will also forget thy children, even I.</span> The punishment resembles the offence; the human delinquency is reflected in the Divine retaliation. To make this the more pointed, the "thou on thy part (<span class="accented">attah</span>)" at the head of the sentence has its counterpart, or rather is counterbalanced by the "even I" or "I too (<span class="accented">gam ani</span>)" at its close. The severity of the punishment is augmented by the threat that, not only the then existing priests, but their sons after them, would be excluded from the honor of the priesthood. This was touching painfully the tenderest part. It needs scarcely be observed that forgetfulness is only spoken of God in a figurative sense, and after the manner of men, that being forgotten which is no longer the object of attention or affection. "The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>," says Kimchi, "is by way of figure, like the man who forgets something and does not take it to heart." The unusual form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span> has been variously accounted for. The Massorites mark the <span class="accented">aleph</span> before <span class="accented">caph</span> as redundant; it is omitted in several manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi, as also some of the early printed editions. Kimchi confesses his ignorance of its use. Olshausen treats it as a copyist's error; but Ewald "regards it as an Aram-seen pausal form." Some take the reference to be to Israel as a kingdom of priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>) rather than to the actual priesthood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-7.htm">Hosea 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <i>therefore</i> will I change their glory into shame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they were increased</span>; rather, <span class="accented">multiplied</span>. Whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> be taken as infinitive with suffix and prefix, or as a noun, it will amount to the same. The reference is rather to the multitude of the population than to the greatness of their prosperity or the abundance of their wealth. In the latter sense it is understood by the Chaldee paraphrase, but in the former by the Syriac translator. So also Kimchi, where he says, "As for Aaron the priest their father, the Law of truth was in his mouth; but now that his sons have multiplied and spread abroad, they have sinned against me and forgotten my law; according as I did them good they did evil." He also gives as the explanation of others, "As I increased them in wealth and riches, they sinned against me." <span class="cmt_word">Their glory will I change into shame.</span> The "therefore" of the Authorized Version is inserted unnecessarily. Both the Chaldee and Syriac render, "And they changed their glory into shame;" as they took <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> for the infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and that in the sense of the preterit; or the infinitive in the gerundival sense: "changing their glory into shame." Kimchi explains the meaning correctly: "Therefore I made them beads over the people and expiators, yet if they do not observe my Law I will change their glory into shame; and the people will contemn and despise them." Their numbers multiplied with the multiplication of idols, and the apostasy of the people kept pace with both; and now as a fit punishment they are to be deprived of their priestly glory - their dignity and splendor. <span class="cmt_word">They eat up the sin of my people.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> may be understood in either of two senses; and the meaning of the verse will correspond thereto. It may either mean that these faithless priests lived upon the sin of the people, deriving their livelihood and profit from the people's idolatrous practices; or that they were delighted with their sin, approving rather than reproving them for the same. The other explanation understands the word of sin offering, and is thus expressed by Kimchi: "They are only priests for eating up the sin and trespass offering which the people offer on account of sins, not for teaching the Law or right way." <span class="cmt_word">To their iniquity they lift</span> <span class="cmt_word">up</span> (each one) <span class="cmt_word">his soul</span>. They set their heart upon and eagerly desire the continued practice of sin on the part of the people that they may profit by the sacrifices. Thus Kimchi explains this clause in accordance with his exposition of the former: "The priests lift up every one his soul to the sin of the people, saying, When will they sin, and bring sin offering and trespass offering that we may eat?"

He has involved himself in sin and punishment like the people, and that as the consequence of his extreme unfaithfulness; whereas by faithful dealing with the people and discharge of his duty he might have delivered his own soul, as stated by <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-9.htm">Ezekiel 33:9</a>, "Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." It is well explained by Kimchi as follows: "These two <span class="accented">caphs</span> of likeness are by way of abbreviation, and the explanation is - the people are like the priest and the priest is like the people. And the meaning is that, as the people and the priest are equal with respect to sin, so shall they be equal in relation to punishment." <span class="cmt_word">And I will visit upon his ways, and his doings I will bring back to him.</span> The retribution here threatened includes the whole priestly order, not people and priest as one man, according to Pusey, who, however, makes the following excellent comment on <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>: "The word rendered <span class="accented">doings</span> signifies <span class="accented">great doings</span> when used of God, <span class="accented">bold doings</span> on the part of man. These bold presumptuous doings against the Law and will of God, God will bring back to the sinner's bosom," or rather, down overwhelmingly upon his head. The singular individualizes; so both Aben Ezra and Kimchi: "Upon every one of them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase.</span> This part of the verso states the punishment to be inflicted and the reward to be received; it is thus an expansion of the closing clause of the preceding verse, with an obvious allusion to the sin specified in the eighth verse. To eat and not be satisfied may occur in time of famine, or be the effect of disease or the consequence of insatiable craving. "Since," says Kimchi, "they eat in an unlawful manner, their food shall not be to them a blessing." This was one of the punishments threatened for violation of the Law, as we read in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, "When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied." Further, the multiplication of wives or concubines would not increase their posterity; Solomon long previously had been a notable exemplification of this. "So in their cohabitation with their women, since it is in a whorish manner, they shall not increase, for they shall not have children by them; or, if they have, they shall die from the birth." The Hiph. <span class="accented">hiznu</span> has rather the intensive sense of Qal than that of causing or encouraging whoredom. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.</span> The verbal <span class="accented">lishmor</span> either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> has Jehovah for its object, as in the Authorized Version; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">durko</span> or <span class="accented">darkair</span> may be supplied, as is done by Kimchi and Aben Ezra. The former has, "To observe his <span class="accented">ways</span>, for they have no delight in him and in his ways; to observe his ways they have left off;" the latter <span class="accented">has</span>, "They have forsaken Jehovah, to observe his way or his Laws." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kimchi informs us that "Saadiah Gaon of blessed memory has connected the word with the verse that comes after it; they have forsaken the Lord to observe whoredom and wine and new wine." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - It makes no great difference whether we regard this verse as concluding the foregoing or commencing a new paragraph, though we prefer the latter mode of connecting it. It states the debasing influence which debauchery and drunkenness are known to exercise over both head and heart: they dull the faculties of the former and deaden the affections of the latter. The heart is not only the seat of the affections, as with us; it comprises also the, intellect and hill; while the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is not so much to take away as to captivate the heart, Rashi gives the former sense: "<span class="accented">The</span> whoredom and drunkenness to which they are devoted take away their heart from me." Kimchi's explanation is judicious: "The whoredom to which they surrender themselves and the constant drunkenness which they practice take their heart, so that they have no understanding to perceive what is the way of goodness along which they should go." He further distinguishes the <span class="accented">tirosh</span> from the <span class="accented">yayin</span>, remarking that the former is the new wine which takes the heart and suddenly intoxicates. The prophet, having had occasion to mention the sin of whoredom in ver. 10, makes a general statement about the consequences of that sin combined with drunkenness in ver. 10, as not only debasing, but depriving men of the right use of their reason and the proper exercise of their natural affections. The following verses afford abundant evidence of all this in the insensate conduct of Israel at the time referred to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <i>them</i> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - The first of these verses exhibits the private life of the people as depraved by sin and folly; the second their public life as degraded by idolatry and lewdness; while the third points to the corresponding chastisement and its cause. <span class="cmt_word">My people ask counsel at their stocks</span> (literally, <span class="accented">wood</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and their staff declareth unto them</span>. Rashi explains "stocks," or literally, "wood," to mean "a graven image made out of wood;" while Aben Ezra prefaces his exposition of this by an observation which serves well as a link of connection between the eleventh and twelfth verses. It is as follows: "The sign that they are in reality without heart, is that my people turn to ask counsel of its stocks and wood." Kimchi not inaptly remarks, "They are like the blind man to whom his staff points out the way in which he should go." The stupidity of idolatry and the sin of divination are here combined. By the "wood" is meant an idol carved out of wood; while the staff may likewise have an image carved at the top for idolatrous purposes, or it may denote mode of divination by a staff which by the way it fell determined their course. Theophylaet explains this method of divination as follows: "<span class="accented">They</span> set up two rods, and muttered some verses and enchantments; and then the rods falling through the influence of demons, they considered how they fell, whether forward or backward, to the right or the left, and so gave answers to the foolish people, using the fall of the rods for <span class="accented">signs</span>." Cyril, who attributes the invention of rabdomancy to the Chaldeans, gives the same account of this method of divination. Herodotus mentions a mode of divination prevalent among the Scythians by means of willow rods; and Tacitus informs us that the Germans divined by a rod cut from a fruit-bearing tree. "They (the Germans) cut a twig from a fruit tree, and divide it into small pieces, which, distinguished by certain marks, are thrown promiscuously on a white garment. Then the priest or 'the canton, it' the occasion be public - if private, the master of the family - after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and as they come up, interprets their signification according to the marks fixed upon them." The sin and folly of any people consulting an idol of wood about the success or otherwise of an undertaking, or deciding whether by a species of teraphim or staff divination, is sufficiently obvious. But the great aggravation of Israel's sin arose from the circumstance not obscurely hinted by the possessive "my" attached to "people." That a people like Israel, whom God had chosen from among the nations of the earth and distinguished by special tokens of Divine favor, and to whom he had given the ephod with the truly oracular Urim and Thummim, should forsake him and the means he had given them of knowing his will, and turn aside to gods of wood, evinced at once stupidity unaccountable and sin inexcusable. "The prophet," says Calvin, "calls here the Israelites the people of God, not to honor them, but rather to increase their sin; for the more heinous was the perfidy of the people, that, having been chosen, they had afterwards forsaken their heavenly Father.... Now this people, that ought to be mine, consult their own wood, and their staff answers them!" <span class="cmt_word">For the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a-whoring from under their God.</span> In this part of the verse the prophet attempts to account for the extreme folly and heinous sin of Israel, as described in the first clause. It was an evil spirit, some demoniac power, that had inspired them with an insuperable fondness for idolatry, which in prophetic language is spiritual adultery. The consequence was a sad departure from the true God and a sinful wandering away from his worship, notwithstanding his amazing condescension and love by which he placed himself in the relation of a husband towards them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof <i>is</i> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good.</span> The prophet here enlarges on the sin of idolatry mentioned in the preceding verse, and explains fully how it showed itself in the public life of the people. Two places are specified as scenes of idolatrous worship: one was the tops of mountains and hills; the other under every green tree, here specified as oaks, poplars, and terebinths, whether growing alone or in groves, in vale or upland. The hills and mountain-tops were selected on account of their elevation, as though the worshippers were thus brought nearer to the objects of their adoration; the green trees as affording shade from the scorching heat of an Eastern sun, secrecy for their licentious rites, and a sort of solemn awe associated with such shadow. In such scenes they not only slew victims, but burnt odors in honor of their idols. The resemblance to, if not imitation of, the rites of heathenism in all this is obvious. Among the Greeks the oak was sacred to Jupiter at Dodona, and among the old Britons the Druidical priests practiced their superstitions in the shadow of the yaks. The poplar again was sacred to Hercules, affording a most grateful shade; while in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a> we read that "under every thick terebinth" was one of the places where "they did offer sweet savor to their idols." The inveterate custom of these idolaters is implied in the Piel or iterative form of the verb; the singular of the nouns, <span class="accented">under oak and poplar and terebinth</span>, intimates that scene after scene of Israel's sin passes under the prophet's review, each exciting his deep indignation; the mention of the goodly shadow seems designed to heighten that feeling of just indignation, as though it came into competition or comparison with "the shadow of the Almighty," the abiding-place of him that "dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses</span> (properly, <span class="accented">daughters-in-law</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall commit adultery</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> primarily signifies "bride," but for the parents of the bridegroom, "daughter-in-law," its secondary sense. The bad example of the parents acts upon their children and reacts upon themselves; on their children in causing bad conduct, on themselves by way of chastisements. The parents had been guilty of spiritual whoredom by their idolatry; their daughters and daughters-in-law would commit whoredom in the literal and carnal sense. This would wound the parents' feelings to the quick and pain them in the tenderest part. Their personal honor would be compromised by such scandalous conduct on the part of their daughters; their family honor would be wounded and the fair fame of posterity tarnished by such gross misconduct on the part of the daughters-in-law. The following observations are made on the last member of this thirteenth verse by the Hebrew commentators: "Because the men of the house go out of the city to the high mountains and under every green tree there to serve idols, therefore their daughters and daughters-in-law have opportunity to commit whoredom and adultery" (Kimchi). To like purpose Aben Ezra writes: "The sense is - On the bare mountains and so on the hills they sacrifice; they say to the priests of Baal that they shall sacrifice; and therefore, because the men go out of the cities in order to burn incense, the daughters and daughters-in-law remain in the houses behind, therefore they commit whoredom." Somewhat different is the explanation of Rashi: "<span class="accented">Because</span> ye <span class="accented">asso</span>ciate for idolatry after the manner of the heathen, and the heathen associate with you, and ye form affinities with them, your daughters also who are born to you by the daughters of the heathen conduct themselves after the manner of their mothers, and commit whoredom." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people <i>that</i> doth not understand shall fall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery.</span> The spiritual adultery of parents and husbands would be punished by the carnal adultery of daughters and wives; sin would thus be punished by sin. Their own dishonor and disgrace, through the unfaithfulness of persons so near to them, would impress them with a sense of the dishonor done to God, the spiritual Husband of his people; their feeling of pain and shame in consequence would convey to them a clearer notion of the abhorrence which their offences had occasioned to God. But their punishment would become more severe, and their pain intensified by the Divine refusal to avenge them by punishing the lewdness that caused such dishonor. While punishment would prevent the sin and consequent reproach, impunity, or the postponement of punishment, would leave the offenders to go on in their course of sin and shame. Aben Ezra comments on this fourteenth verse as follows: "The sense is - It is not to be wondered at if the daughters commit whoredom; for they themselves, when they go up to the tops of the mountains to burn incense, eat and drink with harlots and commit whoredom - all of them. And, behold, the sense is, not that he shall not punish them at all, but he speaks in regard to, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in comparison with, the fathers; for they teach them to commit whoredom doing according to their works. Perhaps the daughters are still little, therefore I shall not punish." Rashi thinks that this threatening refers to the disuse of the bitter waters of jealousy, so that suspected guilt could not be detected. But there is nothing to intimate such a reference; nor would it be in keeping with the scope of the passage. Again, some, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, read the words, not indicatively, but interrogatively - "Shall I not punish," etc.? This would require such a meaning to be read into the passage as the following: "Assuredly I shall punish them; and not the daughters and daughters-in-law only, but the parents and husbands still more severely, because of their greater criminality." Equally unsatisfactory is the explanation of Theodoret, who, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in a good sense, which it has with the accusative, understands it of God's refusing any protection or preservation of their daughters and spouses from outrage at the hands of a hostile soldiery, so that such sins as they themselves had been guilty in private, would be committed with the females of their family in public. <span class="cmt_word">For they themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots.</span> The change of person appears to imply that God turns away with inexpressible disgust from such vileness, and, turning aside to a third party, explains the grounds of his procedure. The <span class="accented">Qedesheth</span> were females who devoted themselves to licentiousness in the service of Ashtaroth, the Sidonian Venus. Persons of this description were attached to idol temples and idolatrous worship in heathen lands in ancient times, as in India at the present time. The 'Speaker's Commentary' calls them "devotee-harlots," and cites an allusion to the custom from the Moabite Stone, as follows: "I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-kemosh." After stating the humiliating fact that fathers and husbands in Israel, instead of uniting with their wives in the worship of Jehovah, separated themselves, going aside with these female idolaters for the purpose of lewdness, and shared in their sacrificial feasts, the prophet, or rather God by the prophet, impatient of the recital of such shameless licentiousness, and indignant at such presumptuous sinning, closes abruptly with the declaration of the recklessness, and denunciation of the ruin of all such offenders, in the words  - <span class="cmt_word">the people that doth not understand shall fall</span>; margin, be <span class="accented">punished</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dashed to the ground</span>, or <span class="accented">plunge into ruin</span> (<span class="accented">nilbat</span>). Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi give from the Arabic, as an alternative sense of <span class="accented">silbat</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> fall into error. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, <i>yet</i> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - In this section the prophet, as if despairing of any improvement or amendment on the part of Israel, still resolutely bent on spiritual whoredom, addresses an earnest warning to Judah. From proximity to those idolatries and debaucheries so prevalent in this northern kingdom, and from the corruption at least of the court in the southern kingdom during the reigns of Joram, Ahaziah, and Ahaz, Judah was in danger; and hence the prophet turned aside, with words of earnest warning, to the sister kingdom not to involve herself in the same or similar guilt. Rashi's brief comment here is, "Let not the children of Judah learn their ways." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-avert, nor swear, The Lord liveth.</span> From a solemn warning in general terms, he proceeds to a specific prohibition. The prohibition forbids pilgrimages to places of idol-worship, such as Gilgal and Bethaven; it also forbids a profession of Jehovah-worship to be made by persons inclined to idolatrous practices. Gilgal, now the village of <span class="accented">Jiljilia</span>, which had been a school of the prophets in the days of Elijah and Elisha, had, as we may rightly infer from passages in Hoses and Amos, become a seat of idolatrous worship. The Hebrew interpreters confound the Gilgal here referred to with the still more renowned Gilgal between Jericho and the Jordan, where Joshua circumcised the people a second time, and celebrated the Passover, and where, manna failing, the people ate of the old corn of the land. "And why," asks Kimchi, "to Gilgal? Because at Gilgal the sanctuary was at the first when they entered the land; therefore when they went to worship idols they built high places there for the idols. But with respect to the tribe of Judah, what need has it to go to Gilgal and to leave the house of the sanctuary which is in their own cities?" And Beth-el, now <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, had become Beth-avon - the house of God a house of idols, after Jeroboam had set up the calf there. Judah was to eschew those places so perilous to purity of worship; also a practice hypocritical in its nature and highly dangerous in its tendency, namely, confessing Jehovah with the lips, and by a solemn act of attestation indicative of adherence to his worship, but belying that confession by complicity in idolatrous practices, like the peoples who "worshipped Jehovah, but served their own gods." Kimchi observes as follows: "For ye engage in strange worship, and yet swear by the Name of Jehovah; this is the way of incensing and despising him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Israel slideth back as a back, sliding heifer: now the Lord will feed them s, a lamb in a large place.</span> This verse  conveys the reason of the warning contained in the preceding; and that reason is the punishment which is to overtake Israel as the consequence of their refractoriness. If this view of the connection be correct, it will help to the right understanding of a difficult passage. The "backsliding," according to the Authorized Version, is rather "stubbornness," "intractableness," or "unmanageableness." Keil renders it "refractory." This refractoriness was Israel's sin; the people would have their own way, and became refractory, like an unmanageable heifer, which rebels upon being trained. Aben Ezra explains <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (which, by the way, has <span class="accented">tsere</span> before the tone syllable) as follows: "<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d9;</span> is he who turns aside from the way that is appointed him, so that he does not walk in it. And, behold, he compares Israel to a stubborn cow, with which a man cannot plough." So also Kfinchi: "Like a heifer which goes on a crooked way, and curves itself from under the yoke, that a man cannot plough with it; so Israel are crooked under their God, as they have taken upon them the yoke of the Law and of the command-meats which he commanded them, and curve themselves under the yoke, and break from off them the yoke of the commandments." Israel rebelled against instruction, waxed stubborn and intractable. They would have their own way, and worshipped according to their own will, in indulging all the while with a high hand in vilest lusts. Now the season of punishment is arrived; and as they refused instruction and rebelled against Divine guidance, God, in just judgment and deserved punishment, leaves them to themselves. Carried into captivity, they may worship what they will, and live as they list. In these circumstances they will resemble a lamb taken away into a wilderness, and left there to range the wild and live at large, but without provision and without protection. Untended by the shepherd's watchful care, unguarded from ravening wolves or other beasts of prey, that lamb is in a lost and perishing condition. So shall it be with Israel. Aben Ezra gives as an alternative sense: "Now (Jehovah will feed them like a lamb) alone in a wide place, and it wanders to and fro." Kimchi cites as the opinion of others: "Some say, Now will Jehovah let them feed alone in a wide place, like a lamb which bleats and goes to and fro, and neither rests nor feeds." Another meaning has been attached to the verse, to the effect that Israel, subdued by chastise-meat, will renounce their stubbornness, and, rendered tractable and tame, become like a lamb, which, brought to feel its helplessness amid a wilderness, requires and receives the shepherd's care. We much prefer the former. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">Ephraim <i>is</i> joined to idols: let him alone.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim is joined to idols</span>: let him alone. Ephraim being the dominant tribe, gave its name to the northern kingdom. The idols were Ephraim's folly, and to that they were wedded; and in consequence they are left to their folly, and at the same time surrendered to their fate. They may persist in their folly; they cannot be prevented. "Give him rest," as the words literally mean, from exhortations and expostulations, from remonstrances and reproofs; he will persist in his folly, prepare for his fate, and perish by his sin. This abandonment of Ephraim proves the desperate nature of his case. Left to his own recklessness, he is rushing towards ruin. Judah is warned to stand aloof from the contagion, lest by interference he might get implicated in the sin and involved in the punishment of Ephraim. The Hebrew commentators express the word rendered "<span class="accented">joined</span> to" in the Authorized Version (ver. 17) by words importing "<span class="accented">yoked</span> to," "allied with," and "<span class="accented">cleaving</span> to."

Aben Ezra: "Let him alone till God shall chastise him; perhaps his eyes shall then open." Kimchi: "Jehovah says to the prophet, Cease to reprove him, for it is of no use .... As a man who is angry with his fellow, because he will not hearken to him when he reproves him, and <span class="accented">says</span>, Since thou hearkenest not to me, I will cease for ever to reprove thee."

But though drunkenness and debauchery frequently go together, it is rather during the former than afterwards that the latter is indulged in. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The first clause had better be understood figuratively, and the latter either literally or figuratively, or both. Thus the sense is the degeneracy of principle among the people in general, or rather among the principal men of that day. By the finest wine becoming vapid, the prophet represents the leading men of the nation, on whom so much depended and from whom so much might be expected, as becoming unprincipled, and as being addicted to immorality or idolatry, or probably both (<span class="accented">hazneh hiznu</span>): "whoring they have committed whoredom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">Her rulers</span> (margin, <span class="accented">shields</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with shame do love, Give ye</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">her shields lore</span>, <span class="accented">love shame</span>.

Most modern expositors take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> as a contraction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d5;</span>, and so a repetition of part of the full verb preceding; thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "loved, loved." Ewald, Delitzsch, and Pusey understand it so; the latter says this "is probably one of the earliest forms of the intensive verb, repeating a part of the verb itself with its inflection." And Keil calls it "a construction resembling the <span class="accented">pealal</span> form." Among the <span class="accented">sebirin</span>, or conjectural readings, we find both words united into one; thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "mightily love." The shields are the princes, or natural protectors of the state, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>, "The princes of the people are gathered together.., for the shields of the earth be. long unto God." The shame they loved was the sin which is a shame to either princes or people, causes shame, and ends in shame. Isaiah expounds the thought (in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>), a comparison of which confirms the above exposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The wind hath bound her up in her wings</span>; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">she hath bound up the wind with her in her skirts</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the one case the wind is the strong storm-wind of Divine wrath that will seize on Ephraim, wrap her up with its wings, and carry her away.

The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> translation of the first clause of ver. 19 is supported by Rashi: "The storm takes her in its wings, as that bird which the wind does not let rest until it makes him go far away; so the enemies will come upon them and carry them into exile."

The house of Israel is the northern kingdom; and the house of the king is the members of the king's family, of his court and of his government. Thus the rulers and the ruled, the spiritual teachers and the taught, are comprehended in this address. Neither priestly office, nor popular power, nor princely dignity was to be exempted. But, though all are summoned to give audience, the heads of the people, the men of light and leading, are first arraigned. For judgment is toward you, as the clause is correctly rendered; not, "it devolves on you to maintain judgment," as some understand it. It had, indeed, been the province of the priest to teach, and of the king to execute the judgments of God in Israel; but now they are themselves the subjects of judgment. Judgment was now to begin at the house of the king and of the priest; God was about to execute judgment upon them - the judgment from that judgment-seat where justice never miscarries, and where no mistake is ever made. The cause of this is assigned. <span class="cmt_word">Because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</span> Instead of being safeguards of the people, they had been a snare to them; instead of being true leaders, as God had intended them, they had misled them; instead of contributing to their security, they had seduced them to sin and so helped to prepare them for destruction; they had been a snare to entrap and a net to entangle. East as well as west of the Jordan their evil influence had wrought ruin. Mizpah, now <span class="accented">es-Salt</span>, was on the east of the river among the hills of Gilead, where Jacob and Laban entered into covenant; Tabor, like a solitary cone or sugar-loaf, rises up from the plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon, on the west of the river. On the wooded slopes of Tabor and the beacon-hill of Mizpah game, no doubt, abounded and found covert, and hence the origin of the figure here used; but they had probably become scenes of idolatry or wickedness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-2.htm">Hosea 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <i>have been</i> a rebuker of them all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the revolters are profound to make slaughter</span> (or, <span class="accented">profuse in murders or in sacrifices</span>, <span class="accented">or in dealing corruptly</span>), though I have been a rebuker of them all (rather, <span class="accented">but I am</span> [<span class="accented">bent upon</span>] <span class="accented">chastisement for them all</span>). The literal rendering of the first clause is, <span class="accented">slaughtering they have made deep</span>, which is an idiom analogous to "they have deeply revolted;" literally, "they have made revolting deep" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>). The slaughtering, though understood by Wunsche of sacrifices, is rather meant of the destruction and carnage which the revolters caused to the people. Rashi explains it literally in this way: "I said, Every one that goes not up to the stated feasts transgresses a positive precept; but they decree that every one who goes up to the stated feasts shall be slain." This seems to imply that liers-in-wait were set probably on Mizpah and Tabor, the places mentioned in the preceding verse, to slay the Israelites that were found going up to the feasts at Jerusalem. Aben Ezra, taking this second verse as continuing the sentiment of the first, interprets as follows: "Ye have been a snare on Mizpah that ye might not allow them to go up to the feasts to the house of the Lord; and to slay (victims) in the usual way." The revolters or apostates he takes to be the worshippers of Baal. "<span class="accented">They</span> made deep," he adds in his exposition, "the snares, those that are mentioned, that passers-by might not see them; but I will chastise all of them for this evil which they have done, since it is not hidden from me why they have hid (made) it so deep." The slaughtering is thus understood by Aben Ezra of slaying the sacrificial victims. Similarly Kimchi interprets thus: "He says that the revolters who are the worshippers of idols, who depart from the ways of God - blessed be he! - and kern his service, like a woman who is a revolter from under her husband, have made deep their revolt, slaying and sacrificing to idols." lie would understand the slaughtering neither of victims with Kimchi and Aben Ezra; nor of literally slaying Israelites to prevent persons going up to Jerusalem, the proper seat of Jehovah's worship; but of the destructive consequences which the conduct of these apostates brought on the people. The work of chastisement God now takes in hand in good earnest. Droppings of the coming shower there had been; but now the full flood is to descend, for God presents himself to misleaders and misled alike under the sole aspect of rebuke. "I," he says, "am chastisement" (give myself to it). A like form of expression occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> am prayer;" that is, am a man of prayer, or give royal. If to prayer. Thus Kimchi explains the idiom: "<span class="accented">The</span> prophet says, Say not that no man shall correct and reprove them, therefore they sin; for I am the person who reproves them all, and day by day I reprove them, but they will not hearken to me. But <span class="accented">raani moser</span> wants the word <span class="accented">ish</span>, man, as (in <a href="../../par/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>) <span class="accented">raani tephilah</span>, which we have explained <span class="accented">raani ish tephilah</span>."

However deep they dig downward, God will bring their evil doings up and out to the light of day and punish them. <span class="cmt_word">For now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</span> Israel is the northern kingdom, and Ephraim, being the most powerful tribe, is often identified with Israel; here, however, they are distinguished - Israel is the kingdom as a whole, and Ephraim is its leading tribe. This powerful tribe, ever envious of Judah, was the ringleader in the calf worship of Jeroboam and other idolatries; and through Ephraim's evil influence the other tribes, and so all Israel, were defiled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <i>is</i> in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In this verse their evil doings are traced to an evil spirit of whoredoms that is, of idolatries, which impels them blindly and resistlessly to evil, while at the same time it expels the knowledge of God. The first clause is differently rendered. The textual rendering of the Authorized Version, viz. they will not frame (literally, <span class="accented">give</span>, <span class="accented">direct</span>) their doings to turn unto their God, denotes their total and absolute refusal to repent or to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. The actions are an index of the state of the heart, but neither the thoughts of Israel at this time, nor their deeds which indicated these thoughts, were in the direction of repentance. In heart and life they were impenitent. This rendering is supported by most of the Hebrew commentators. Rashi says, "They forsake not their evil way;" Aben Ezra," They perform not works so as to turn." Kimchi also gives an alternative sense: "Or the sense of the words is thus: They cling so closely to their evil works, that even should they for once conceive in their heart the idea of turning, they immediately repent them of it." The marginal rendering also yields a good sense; it is, <span class="accented">Their doings</span> <span class="accented">will not suffer</span> (allow) [<span class="accented">them</span>] <span class="accented">to turn unto their God</span>. The pronominal suffix for "them" is wanting, yet it may be dispensed with, as the appending of it to "doings" and "God" makes the sense sufficiently explicit. It is favored by Ewald, Keil, the Targum, and Kimchi, who explains: "Their evil works do not allow them to return to their God, as if he said, To such extent have they multiplied transgression that there is no way left them to return, until they receive their punishment." Such and so great was the power of their evil habits that they could not break them off or break away from them by repentance; or so intimately connected is a change of heart with a change of life that, in the absence of the latter, the former is impossible. According to either rendering, the reason assigned is contained in the next clause: <span class="cmt_word">For the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.</span> So overmastered were they, as though by some fiendish spirit that held them in check and exercised despotic power over them, that they rushed headlong down the steep incline, like the Gadarene herd of swine, which, when the unclean spirits entered into them, ran violently down a steep place into the sea. Neither was there any counteracting force to turn them back or reverse their course. Such a force might have been found in the knowledge of God, of his covenant mercy, of his power, love, grace, and goodrich. But this was wanting, and the absence of this knowledge at once increased their impenitence and aggravated their guilt. It was Israel's privilege and Israel's duty to know the Lord; for he had revealed himself to them as to no other nation; he had given them his Law, he had made them depositaries of his truth and the conservators of his living oracles; their ignorance, therefore, was altogether inexcusable, while it evinced greatest ingratitude to Jehovah, who had taken them into covenant with himself, and declared himself to be their God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face.</span> This may be understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of Jehovah, who was Israel's glory, as we read in <a href="../../par/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a> <span class="accented">of</span> "the excellency of Israel." This explanation suits at once the sense and the context. They knew not God, notwithstanding the special advantages they enjoyed for that knowledge; they had no liking to the knowledge of' Go,], they did not concern themselves about it; and now Jehovah, who should have been their excellency and glory, but who had been thus slighted by them, will testify against them and bear witness to their face by judgments. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> another interpretation recommends itself as equally or more suitable. This interpretation understands "pride" more simply to mean the prosperous state and flourishing condition of which Israel was proud, or rather, perhaps, the haughtiness of Israel, owing to those very circumstances of worldly wealth and greatness. This vain pride and self-exaltation was the great obstacle in the way of their turning to the Lord. If this sense of the word be accepted, the verb had better be rendered" humbled," a meaning which it often has; thus, "humbled shall be the pride of Israel to his face" (that is, in his own sight). Such is the translation of the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "The pride of Israel shall be brought low before his face;" while the Chaldee translates similarly, "<span class="accented">The</span> glory of Israel shall be humbled while they see it;" the Syriac has, "The pride of Israel shall be humbled in his presence," or before his eyes. Aben Ezra also takes the idea of the verb to be humiliation or depression; while Kimchi takes <span class="accented">gaon</span> not so much in the sense of the inward feeling, as of <span class="accented">those</span> outward circumstances that promoted it - their greatness and grandeur and glory; and, alluding to the words of the Chaldee rendering, "in their sight," he says, "While they are still in their land before their captivity, they shall perceive their humiliation and degradation, instead of the glory which they had at the beginning." Kimchi, however, as well as most other commentators, seems to have understood the verb in the sense of "testify;" thus, "Israel's pride will testify to his face, when he shall take upon him its punishment." Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. Pride usually goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. The consequence of Israel's pride was the fall here mentioned. The ten tribes composing the northern kingdom fell into gross and grievous sin, and therefore also into long-suffering and sore sorrow. Even Ephraim, that tribe pre-eminent for power as for pride, and the perpetual rival of Judah, shall fall as well as and with the rest. Judah also, that is, Judah proper, and Benjamin, participating in the same evil course, fell like Israel into sin, and, though more than a century later, into ruin. In vers. 6-10 the prophet details the unavailing and ineffectual efforts of Israel to avert, or at least escape from, the threatened judgments. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find <i>him</i>; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord.</span> In this way they attempt to break, if not pro-vent, their fall. With numerous and costly sacrifices they endeavor to propitiate Jehovah. With sheep and goats out of their flocks, and with bullocks and heifers out of their herd, they try to make reparation for the past or to secure present and future favor. But in vain. Israel might go to Bethel and Judah to Jerusalem; but to no purpose. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself</span>. Their repentance came too late; or when it did come it wanted sincerity; or it was a wrong motive which prompted it - fear of approaching calamity and not love to their Creator; or their sins ran parallel with their sacrifice. Forgetting that obedience is better than sacrifice, they cherished a disobedient spirit or continued in their course of disobedience notwithstanding their outward sacrificial service. For one cause or other they fail in their efforts to find him; for, instead of being a present help in time of trouble, he has withdrawn beyond their reach; he has removed the Shechinah-glory of his presence from among them; or he has loosed himself from all those ties that once bound him in mercy to them, just as a husband frees himself from all responsibilities and disarms all liabilities on behalf of a faithless partner whom he has been forced to divorce. And such is the specific reason assigned in the next verse.

In consequence of the infidelity of the wife, the children were not the offspring of lawful wedlock or conjugal union; in other words, they were children of whoredom - an adulterous generation.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <i>and</i> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <i>at</i> Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah.</span> Intimation had been given in the preceding verse that the period of their fast-approaching destruction was at hand; that, as Kimchi expresses it, the now moon would soon come at which their enemies would destroy them. Now he pictures them as already on the march, and just advancing to execute the work of destruction; while the terror and alarm consequent thereon are here presented with great vividness, but at the same time with much brevity. A similar scene is depicted at full length by <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>, where the line of the Assyrians' march seems to be indicated, if, indeed, it be not a poetic representation of it, which the prophet gives. Thus from Aiath (<span class="accented">el-Tell</span>) to the pass of Michmash, now <span class="accented">Mukmas</span>, where he lays up his baggage; forward to Gobs, where they quarter for the night; then on to Nob, where he halts in sight at the holy city, and scarce an hour's march distant. The alarm was to be sounded with the <span class="accented">shophar</span>, or far-sounding cornet, made of curved horn, and the <span class="accented">chatsotserah</span>, or straight trumpet, made of brass or silver, used in war or at festivals. This signal of hostile invasion was to he sounded in Gibeah, now <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-Ful</span>, some four miles north of Jerusalem, and in Ramah, now <span class="accented">er-Ram</span>, two miles further distant. Both these towns, situated on eminences, as the names denote, belong to the northern boundary of Benjamin. The overthrow of the northern kingdom is rims presented as an already accomplished fact; while the invading host has already reached the frontier of the southern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Cry aloud at Beth-avon, after thee, O Benjamin.</span> This cry is the sound at' the war-signals already mentioned, and the repetition intensifies the nature of the alarm and the urgency of the case. Beth-avon was either Bethel, now <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, on the border of Benjamin, or a town nearer Michmash, belonging to Benjamin. The meaning of the somewhat obscure words in the concluding clause can give little trouble, when read in the light of the context. The sounding of the alarm of war indicates with tolerable plainness what was coming behind Benjamin; nor is there need to supply the words, "the enemy rises behind thee," with same, or" the sword rages behind thee," with others. The signals announce the foe as arrived at the frontier of Judah. The enemy is close behind thee, Benjamin, in close pursuit after thee, upon thy very heels. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke.</span> The day of rebuke is the season when God rebukes sin by punishment; the punishment in this case is no slight rebuke or temporary chastisement. On the contrary, it is extreme in severity and final in duration. Famine, or pestilence, or war might lay a country desolate for a time, and yet relief might soon ensue and recuperative power be vigorously developed. Not so here. Ephraim is made more than desolate partially and for a short period; it becomes a desolation - "an entire desolation," as the words literally mean. In this desolation the other tribes would be involved. Nor was the menace lightly to be regarded or treated as meaningless; it was firm - well grounded as the word of the Eternal, and irreversible as his decree.

Thus <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>, "Thou shall not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance;" and again Deuteronomy 27:17, "Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen." The removal of the landmark characterizes the conduct of men entirely regardless of the rights of others - utterly reckless. The Jewish nobles, the king's ministers and high officers of state, are compared to those who remove the landmark, disregarding alike what was due to their fellow-men and to their God. The Jewish commentators differ in their exposition between tact and figure  - some of them taking the removal of the boundary as a matter of fact, the <span class="accented">caph</span> being for confirmation; thus D. Kimchi; while I. Kimchi explains it of the rejection of the appeal for justice against removers of landmarks; others understanding it figuratively, and the whole as expressing general lawlessness, thus Rashi: "Like a man who removes his neighbor's landmark, just so they hasten to hold fast the ways of Israel their neighbors...  according to the literal sense, They grasped at the fields; but this, in my opinion, is harsh, for then the prophet must have written merely <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span>, and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span>." Similarly Aben Ezra: "They exercise violence towards those who are in their power, whilst they are like those who secretly remove the landmark." The people of Judah had also sinned, and, like Israel in sin, they resemble them in suffering. There-tore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. The word "wrath" here is from a root which signifies "to overflow;" it is thus the overflowing of Divine indignation; while the outpouring thereof denotes the full flood of wrath that will overwhelm those lawless leaders of a misguided and misgoverned people. The execution of the threatening was reserved for the Assyrians. who, under Tiglath-pileser and Sennacherib, invaded and laid waste the land. And yet those judgments, though so severe and plentiful, were not to end in total and lasting devastation as in the case of Israel. The following vers. 11-15 teach the inevitable nature of the judgments that were coming upon both Israel and Judah, and from which no earthly power could deliver them. The only relief possible depended on their seeking God in the day of their distress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-11.htm">Hosea 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">Ephraim <i>is</i> oppressed <i>and</i> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment</span>. The expression <span class="accented">retsuts mishpat</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some explained, "crushed by the judgment," that is, of God, according to which <span class="accented">mishpat</span> would be the genitive of the agent as <span class="accented">mukkeh Elohim</span>. But "crushed of judgment" or in judgment is justly preferred by others, the genitive taking the place of the accusative. Again, though the combination of '<span class="accented">ashuq</span> with <span class="accented">rutsuts</span> is frequent, occurring as early as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, the latter is the stronger term. The oppression is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> not that which their own kings and princes practiced upon their subjects, according to Aben Ezra, "Their kings oppressed and cheated them;" nor the injustice practiced by the people of Ephraim among themselves, as implied by the LXX., "Ephraim altogether prevailed against his adversary, he trod judgment underfoot." The reference <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is rather to Ephraim being oppressed and crushed in judgment by the heathen nations around; thus Rashi explains, "Oppressed is Ephraim ever by the hand of the heathen - chastised with chastisements;" so also Kimchi, "By the hand of the heathen who oppressed and crushed them through hard judgments." The construction is asyndetous, like <a href="../../par/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>, "The rain is over, is gone." <span class="cmt_word">Because he willingly walked after the commandment.</span> This clause assigns the reason of Ephraim's oppression. They evinced ready willing-hood in following <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the commandments of men instead of the commandments of God. <span class="accented">Tsav</span> is thus understood by Aben Ezra, and in like manner Ewald explains it to mean an arbitrary or self-imposed precept. The LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, vanity, translating, "for he began to go after vanities (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" which the Chaldee and Syriac fellow. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is rather the commandment of Jeroboam about the worship of the calves which lay at the root of the nation's sin. It is welt explained by Kimchi: "Although the word 'Jeroboam' is wanting, so that he makes no mention of it after <span class="accented">tsar</span>, such is the scriptural usage in certain places, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to omit a word where the sense is plain. For it was a well-known fact that in that generation they walked not after the commandment, but after that of Jeroboam; therefore he has abbreviated the word to indicate the worthlessness, and used <span class="accented">tsav</span> instead of <span class="accented">mitsvah</span>." Perhaps it may have the concrete sense of the object of idolatrous worship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-12.htm">Hosea 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span> This verse is well explained by Calvin as follows: "The meaning of the prophet is by no means obscure, and that is, that the Lord would by a slow corrosion consume both the people; and that, though he would not by one onset destroy them, yet they would pine away until they became wholly rotten." The two agents of destruction here named - the moth which eats away clothes, and the woodworm which gnaws away wood - figuratively represent slow but sure destruction. They are found together in <a href="../../par/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>. Kimchi explains the sense in like manner: "<span class="accented">Like</span> the moth which eats away garments, and like the woodworm which consumes bones and wood, so shall I consume you." The pronoun at the beginning of the verse is emphatic: "<span class="accented">I your</span> God, who would have been your protector and preserver, whom you have sinfully forsaken, and whose commandments you have arbitrarily set aside - even I am to you as the source of rottenness, and of slow but sure ruin." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <i>saw</i> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to King Jareb</span>. Both kingdoms became conscious of their disease and decline; Ephraim felt its sickness or internal consumption, Judah its wound or external corruption (<span class="accented">mazor</span>, a festering wound, from <span class="accented">zur</span>, to squeeze out); they were both conscious of rottenness in their condition. That diseased condition was rather spiritual apostasy than political adversity, though these were connected as cause and effect. But, instead of applying to Jehovah, Ephraim had recourse to Assyria and its king for health and help, but in vain; for no earthly power could avert the Divine judgments. The punishment threatened in the twelfth verse prompts the efforts to obtain succor mentioned in this. The general sense of the verse is given by Kimchi as follows: "When Ephraim and Judah saw that the enemies were constantly invading and plundering them, they seek help from the King of Assyria; but turn not back to me, nor seek help from me, but from flesh and blood, which, however, cannot help them when it is not my pleasure." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some, as the Jewish interpreters, refer the first clause as a matter of course to Ephraim, but the second to Judah; thus, Jerome in like manner understands Ephraim's visit of that to Pul, recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a>, and the message of Judah to Tiglath-pileser (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a>.); but an interval of thirty years lay between the two events thus described as synchronous. Rashi explains the former clause of Hoshea's visit to Shalmaneser the King of Assyria, and the second of Ahaz's to Tiglath-pileser; Kimchi, again, refers the former to Menahem visiting Pul, and the second of Ahaz to Tiglath-pileser (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ephraim is the subject in both clauses, so that there is no need of a supposed reference to Judah in the second. Calvin correctly restricts them both to Ephraim, and accounts for the restriction as follows: "Why, then, does he name only Ephraim? Even because the beginning of this evil commenced in the kingdom of Israel; for they were the first who went to the King of Assur, that they might, by his help, resist their neighbors, the Syrians; the Jews afterwards followed their example. Since, then, the Israelites afforded a precedent to the Jews to send for aids of this kind, the prophet expressly confines his discourse to them." He admits, however, that the accusation had respect to both in common; or Ephraim may have applied on behalf of Judah as well as for herself. There is much diversity of opinion with regard to the word "Jareb." Some take it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for a proper name, either of an Assyrian king or of some place or city in the country of Assyria. as the LXX., Aben Ezra, and Kimchi; but the absence of the article is opposed to this, neither is <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>, "and Zechariah reigned as king" (<span class="accented">vayyimloch melech</span>), <span class="accented">a</span> proper parallel. Others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> more correctly explain as a qualifying epithet to "king," that is, "pleader," "striver," or "warrior," in ether words, a warlike or champion king, like the epithet of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> among the Greeks. The indefiniteness in this case gives the idea of majesty or might, as in Arabic; thus, "a champion king, and such a king!" <span class="cmt_word">Yet could he not</span> (<span class="accented">yet shall he not be able to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>heal you</span> (plural, and so Ephraim and Judah), <span class="cmt_word">nor cure you of your wound.</span> Whatever the distress was, whether arising from hostile invasion or domestic troubles, those degenerate kings had recourse to foreigners for aid. With the <span class="accented">profitlessness as</span> well as the sinfulness of such attempts they are here sharply rebuked. Thus Calvin: "<span class="accented">Here</span> God declares that whatever the Israelites might seek would be in vain. ' Ye think,' he <span class="accented">says</span>, ' that you can escape my hand by these remedies; but your folly will at length betray itself, for he will avail you nothing; that is, King Jareb will not heal you.'" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">For I <i>will be</i> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <i>even</i> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <i>him</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - These verses assign a reason for the powerlessness even of the mighty Assyrian monarch to help; and that reason is the Divine interposition. The irresistible Jehovah himself (the addition of the pronoun intensifies, yet more its repetition) now interferes for the destruction of the apostate and rebellious people. <span class="cmt_word">For I am unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah.</span> As we are taught in these words, Jehovah's mode of procedure is now changed. Before it had been slow and silent, though sure destruction, as signified by the moth and woodworm; but now it will be public and patent to the eyes of all, as wall as decisive and powerful, as intimated by the comparison of a lion and young lion. Nor is that all: lion-like, lie will rend before removing the prey - a tearing in pieces and then a carrying away. This well-known habit of the lion finds its counterpart in the subsequent facts of Hebrew history. The northern kingdom was first rent or broken up by Shalmaneser; subsequently the population were carried away into captivity; in like manner the southern kingdom suffered at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">I will go and return to my place.</span> The figurative comparison with a lion is continued in the first clause of ver. 15 also. The lion tears his victim and carries it away, then he retires into his cave or den; so Jehovah, after bringing calamity upon Israel, withdraws from the scene and retires to his own place in heaven, though the heaven of heavens cannot contain him. There, in that unapproachable ether, he is inaccessible to and beyond the reach of the guilty nation that knew not nor valued the former times of merciful visitation. One remedy, and only one, is left and that is found in penitence and prayer. Once they find out their guiltiness and humble themselves in repentance, they may hopefully seek his face and favor. Turning away from human help, and supplicating the gracious help of the Divine presence, they are encouraged by the prospect of relict' and revival; while the means to that end are, no doubt, painful, yet profitable. In the school of affliction they learnt penitence and were brought to their knees in prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Their connection with the foregoing sentiments is indicated by the ancient versions  - Chaldee and Septuagint, the LXX., for example, inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as if the reading had been <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>: This <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> represents the Israelites exhorting one another in that good time which the prophet encourages them to expect. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may be regarded as the prophet's own exhortation to the exiles; their affliction urging them to seek the Lord, and their encouragement consisting in the knowledge of his ability and willingness to heal the wounds which his own hand had inflicted. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath torn, and he will heal us.</span> The presence of the pronoun imparts emphasis to the statement, so that it is rather, he <span class="accented">it is that hath torn</span>; and the preterit of this verse, compared with the future in ver. 14 of the foregoing chapter, implies that the destruction there predicted has become an accomplished fact. <span class="cmt_word">He hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</span> The language is figurative, and borrowed from medical science. Jehovah, not Jareb nor any sovereign of Assyria, is the physician. Long before he had assured his people Israel of this, saying, "I am the Lord that healeth thee" (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>); and again, "I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). Aben Ezra, commenting on <span class="accented">yachbeshena</span>, alludes to the ancient mode of surgical practice, probably as indicated m <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>: A wound needs to be pressed out and bound up, and afterwards softened with oil." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</span> The expression of time here employed denotes a comparatively short period, and implies that Israel's revival would be speedily as well as certainly accomplished. Paucity is signified by the binary number in Old Testament language, just as we speak of two, or a couple, in the sense of fewness. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a> we find "two" used in this way: "Behold, I am gathering two sticks;" so in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-21.htm">Isaiah 7:21</a>, "A man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep;" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a> a small number is spoken of as "two or three;" while a short period is similarly described in <a href="../../par/luke/13-32.htm">Luke 13:32</a>, "Behold, I east out devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected." The important idea of this verse connects itself with the terms corresponding to revival, resurrection, and restoration to the Divine favor and protection. The drooping, declining, dying state of Israel would be revived; their deathlike condition would undergo a resurrection process; their disfavor would give way to Divine complacency; and all this, though not immediately, yet in a comparatively short time. This appears to us the import of the prophecy. Similar figurative language, and with like significancy, is employed by Ezekiel (37.) in his vision of the valley and the resurrection of its dry bones; as also by Isaiah (26.), where the same or a similar thought is presented in briefer, but still more beautiful, language: "Thy (lead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead." Calvin understands this verse as containing a source of consolation to Israel. "When," he says, "the Israelites, through their long obstinacy, had become nearly incurable, it was needful to lead them to repentance by slow punishments. They, therefore, said, <span class="accented">After two days God will revive us</span>; and thus they confirmed themselves in the hope of salvation, though it did not immediately appear; though they long remained in darkness, and the exile was long which they had to endure, they yet did not cease to hope. 'Well, lot the two days pass, and the Lord will revive us.'" To man in sorrow the time appears long; it is short in the sight of him with whom a thousand years are as one day. Kimchi's explanation is also, to a certain extent, satisfactory: "The prophet says, 'our sickness lasts for two days, yet he will heal us of our sickness, till on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live long before him,' as if he said, 'though our afflictions continue a long time.' The two days are a figaro, for 'in a short time he will bring us his salvation,' and 'on the third day' is figurative." He afterwards refers the "two days" to the captivities of his people  - that in Egypt and that in Babylon; while "the third day" denotes the third or present Roman captivity, "out of which he will raise us up and we shall live before him? so that we shall never again go into captivity, but shall live continually before him, while we sin no mere." Rashi refers the words to the three temples - that of Solomon, that of Zerubbabel, and the temple that is to be built by Messiah. Some of the Fathers understand the three periods in the history of humanity - the first, under Adam, as the time of Law and captivity to sin; the second, under Christ, as the time of the gospel and of grace; and the third, with Christ, as the time of the general resurrection. Theodoret and most of the Fathers understood this verse to refer to the resurrection of Christ on the third day after three days' rest in the grave. Calvin, after giving what appeared to him "the simple and genuine sense" of the passage as applying primarily to the Jews, as we have already seen, adds, "I do not deny but that God has exhibited a remarkable and memorable instance of what is here said in his only begotten Son. As often, then, as delay begets weariness in us, let us flee to Christ; for, as it has been said, his resurrection is a mirror of our life; for we see in that how God is wont to deal with his own people: the Father did not restore life to Christ as soon as he was taken down from the cross; he was deposited in the sepulcher, and he lay there till the third day. When God, then, intends that we should languish for a time, let us know that we are thus represented in Christ our Head, and hence let us gather materials of confidence. We have, then, in Christ an illustrious proof of this prophecy." The political resurrection of Israel may dimly shadow forth, by way of type, the resurrection of Messiah and the general resurrection of which he is the Firstfruits. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall we know, <i>if</i> we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <i>and</i> former rain unto the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</span> This is more accurately rendered by, <span class="accented">let</span> us <span class="accented">therefore</span> know, <span class="accented">hunt after the knowledge of Jehovah</span>, the verbs being both cohortative and no conditional particle ("if") in the second clause. The second clause is a more emphatic and energetic reaffirmation of the first, urging to active and zealous effort and steady perseverance in obtaining the knowledge of God  - a knowledge theoretic, but especially practical. Aben Ezra understands the exhortation of intellectual knowledge: "To know Jehovah is the secret of all wisdom, and for this alone was man created. But he cannot know God till he has learnt many doctrines of wisdom, which are, as it were, a ladder in order to mount up to this highest step of knowledge." Kimchi, on the other hand, though quoting Aben Ezra's comment with approval, inclines to the practical side of knowledge: "Let us follow on to know Jehovah, exercising justice and righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">His going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</span> Here, again, the translation of the Authorized Version is susceptible of improvement: <span class="accented">his going forth is fixed as the morning dawn</span>; <span class="accented">and he shall come to us as the plentiful rain, as the latter rain which watereth</span> (or, <span class="accented">watering</span>) <span class="accented">the earth</span>. Here we have two beautiful figures - the morning dawn and the fertilizing rain. The going forth of Jehovah is represented as the sun rising upon the earth, or rather as the dawn which heralds the day. The advent of salvation to his people is identified with, or symbolized by, his appearance. But the dawn of day only brings the commencement of salvation; its complement is found in the fruits and blessings of salvation. The root of <span class="accented">motsav</span> is <span class="accented">zatsa</span>, which is applied to the sunrise in <a href="../../par/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>, as also in <a href="../../par/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>. Parallel passages are found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, "Then shall thy light break forth as the morning (dawn), and thy health shall spring forth speedily;" and Isaiah 9:2, "The Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." Further, the word <span class="accented">nakon</span>, meaning "prepared," "fixed firm," is applied to the clear bright light of morning, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>, "The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect (<span class="accented">nekon</span>) day." The plentiful rain is that which falls after the sowing of the seed in October (the beginning of the Hebrew year) and in the following months; while the <span class="accented">malqosh</span> is the late or spring rain, which, tailing in March and till the middle of April, precedes and promotes the harvest. The LXX. translates the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> concluding clause by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> erroneously, for <span class="accented">zoreh</span> is not a noun with b, being understood before "earth;" neither is it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the future Hiph., which would necessitate the ellipse being supplied by <span class="accented">asher</span>; it is the Qal participle in the sense of" watering." <span class="accented">Geshem</span> is "a violent or plentiful rain," stronger than the usual word for" rain," <span class="accented">matar</span>; while <span class="accented">malqosh</span> is "the late rain" which ceases a short time before harvest. The explanation of the "dawn" by Aben Ezra is erroneous: "The intelligent man at the beginning knows God - blessed be he! - by his works, like the dawn of day in its going forth; but moment after moment the light increases, until the full truth becomes visible." Kimchi more correctly explains the figure as follows: "If we shall do this, viz. follow on to know the Lord, then he will be to us as the morning dawn, of which the going forth is fixed [purposed by God and certain] as though he said, He will cause his light and his goodness to shine over us." His comment on the second similitude is equally appropriate: "He will come to us as the plentiful rain, as the plentiful rain which revives the dead plants; so man sunk in sorrow is like one dead; but when deliverance comes to him it is with him as if he revived out of his dead state." Thus he shall be to his people as "morning to the weary watcher," and as "plentiful rain to the parched ground." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <i>is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</span> A new section here commences. God, having tried various expedients and many ways to restore Israel to faithfulness, finds all those methods unavailing; and now he asks what further means of reclamation he can resort to; what further punishment he is to inflict. Thus in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>, "Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more!" or what additional privileges can be vouchsafed? Thus in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, than I have not done in it?" The reason is then assigned for such questioning; it was the brief duration of Israel's piety. It was evanescent as the early cloud which floats across a summer's sky and which the sun soon scatters for ever, or which pro-raises a refreshing shower, but which is exhaled by the sun's heat; it was transient as the dew which lies in pearly drops of beauty upon the grass, but which the foot of the passing traveler brushes away in a moment. The prophet had, in the opening verses, referred to real repentance; but now, turning to Israel, he reminds them of <span class="accented">their</span> repentance by way of con-trust, showing them that it was neither of the consistency nor permanent character required. Proofs of their deficiency lay on the pages of their national history. Hezekiah had done "that which was right in the sight of the Lord;" but his son and successor, Manasseh, "wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to auger." Josiah, again, was eminent for piety, so that "like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might;" but his successors degenerated, for it is added, "neither after him arose there any like him." The connection and meaning are well given by Kimchi: "How shall I heal you, and how shall I bind you up, as your repentance is by no means perfect? For if the kings of Israel did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, so have they soon turned to do evil, like Jehu. And likewise the kings of Judah, who in the days of Josiah did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, turned again to do evil in the days of his son and son's son." Thus he reproves them for the superficial and fleeting character of their goodness. The participles <span class="accented">mashkim</span> and <span class="accented">holek</span> are either co-ordinated asynde-tously, thus: "coming in the morning, going away;" or the latter is subordinated to the former: "<span class="accented">in</span> the morning passing away." Kimchi takes the former word as a noun after the form of <span class="accented">makbir</span>, equivalent to "abundance" (<a href="../../par/job/36-31.htm">Job 36:31</a>); the right rendering is, "as the dew early going away." A somewhat different rendering is proposed by Wunsche, viz. "Your goodness goeth away like a morning cloud, and like the dew in the morning;" "goodness" being the subject, "goeth away" the predicate, "like morning cloud and dew" nearer definitions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-5.htm">Hosea 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore have I hewed <i>them</i> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <i>are as</i> the light <i>that</i> goeth forth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - The consequence of Israel's unsteadiness and inconstancy is here stated. Because of the fluctuating and formal nature of their religiousness, God cut them down (instead of rearing them up) through his prophets by fierce denunciations, and slew them (instead of reviving them) by the Divine word. The judgment of Jehovah went forth as the lightning-fish, or was as clear and conspicuous for justice as the light of day. Neither could outward services expiate their sins, when the proper feelings and meet fruits were absent. <span class="cmt_word">I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</span> The language is figurative - the first clause seems borrowed from hewing hard wood and shaping it so as to assume the required form; so God dealt with Israel to bring them into shape morally symmetrical, and make them correspond to the character of a holy people. The slaying is metaphorical, and consisted in the denunciation of death and destruction to the impenitent; in this way he killed, but did not make alive. A different rendering of the clause is given by the LXX. and also by Aben Ezra; the former has, "Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have slain them with the word of my mouth;" the latter has, "The sense is that he slew some of the prophets who misled the people so that they did not turn (repent)." But <span class="accented">be</span> does not imply his hewing in among the prophets; it is instrumental. <span class="cmt_word">And thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</span> The judgments here spoken of are the Divine judgments denounced against, or inflicted on, the people. Another reading has the pronominal suffix of the first person: "My judgment goeth forth as the light;" to which the Septuagint corresponds: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "my judgment." <span class="accented">I desired mercy</span> (or, <span class="accented">mercy I delight in</span>)...  <span class="accented">and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings</span>. The former is the right state of the life, the latter the correct condition of the heart; the former manifests itself in practice, the latter embraces the proper feelings and affections; the former is seen in works of charity and benevolence, the latter consists in right motives and the right relation of the soul to God. The Hebrew form of speech here used denotes inferior importance, not the negation of importance. A similar sentiment occurs in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." Parallel statements are found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-9</a> and Psalm 50:8; also in <a href="../../par/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Our Lord cites the first clause of ver. 6 twice - once against Pharisaic ceremonialism (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>), and again against rigorous sabbatarianism (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>); while there is an allusion to it in <a href="../../par/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>, where love to God and to one's neighbor is declared to be better, or "more than, whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." Sacrifices in themselves, and when offered at the proper time and place, and as the expressions of penitent hearts and pure hands, were acceptable, and could not be otherwise, for God himself had appointed them. But soulless sacrifices offered by men steeped in sin were an abomination to the Lord; it was of such he said, "I cannot away with" them. It is to such that the prophet refers here, as is plain from the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</div><div class="comm">

God in his great goodness had planted Adam in Paradise; but Adam violated the commandment which prohibited his eating of the tree of knowledge, and thereby transgressed the covenant of his God. Loss of fellowship with God and expulsion from Eden were the penal consequences that immediately followed. Israel, like Adam, had been settled by God in Palestine, the glory of all lands; but, ungrateful for God's great bounty and gracious gift, they broke the covenant of their God, the condition of which, as in the case of the Adamic covenant, was obedience. Thus the comparison projects the shadow of a coming event when Israel would Jose the land of promise. There is still the word "there" to be accounted for. It cannot well be rendered "therein," nor taken as a particle of time equivalent to "the," with Cyril and others. It is local, and points to the place where their breach of covenant and faithlessness had occurred. Yet this local sense is not necessarily so limited as to be referred, with some, to Bethel, as the scene of their apostasy and idolatry. "<span class="accented">There</span>, to Israel," <span class="accented">says</span> Pusey, "<span class="accented">was</span> not only Bethel, or Dan, or Gilgal, or Mizpah, or Gilead, or any or all of the places which God had hallowed by his mercies and they had defiled. It was every high hill, each idol-chapel, each field-altar, which they had multiplied to their idols. To the sinners of Israel it was every spot of the Lord's land which they had defiled by their sin." The word thus acquires a very suggestive significance, reminding Israel of God's goodness on the one hand, and of their own sinfulness and ingratitude on the other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Gilead <i>is</i> a city of them that work iniquity, <i>and is</i> polluted with blood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In these two verses the prophet adduces proof of that faithlessness with which he had just charged Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</span> The latter clause is more literally rendered, <span class="accented">foot-printed</span> or <span class="accented">foot-tracked from blood</span>. Two things require consideration here - the place and its pollution. Gilead is sometimes a mountain range, and sometimes the mountainous region east of the Jordan; it has Bashan on the north, the Arabian plateau on the east, and Moab on the south. It stretches from the south end of the Sea of Galilee to the north end of the Dead Sea - some sixty miles in length by twenty in breadth. The part of Gilead between the Hieromax and the Jabbok is now called <span class="accented">Jebel Ajlun</span>; while the section south of the Jabbok forms the province of <span class="accented">Belka</span>. In the New Testament it is spoken of under the name of Pertea, or beyond Jordan. Sometimes the whole trans-Jordanic territory belonging to Israel is called Gilead. In the passage before us it is the name of a city, though some take it to mean the whole land of Gilead. The men of Gilead and the Gileadites in general seem to have been fierce, wild mountaineers; and yet they are represented as still worse in this Scripture. They are nut only barbarous and wicked, but murderous and infamous for homicidal atrocities. As evidence in some sort of the justness of this dark picture, the murder of Pekahiah by Pekah with "fifty men of the Gileadites." as recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>, may be specified. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some as the feminine of the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, crafty, cunning, wily; thus Rashi explains it: "Gilead is full of people who lie in wait for murder;" and Kimchi likewise has, "Gilead is a city of evil-doers, who are crafty to murder men." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the Qal Pual participle feminine from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to seize the heel of any one, hold, tread in the footsteps, follow, go after; which is the right meaning, viz. "tracked," as given above. We retain the Authorized Version of the first clause of ver. 9, slightly modified, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As troops of robbers wait for a man, so is the company of priests</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>, wait, being an anomalous form of the infinitive Piel for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>; thus Kimchi says, "The <span class="accented">yod</span> stands in the place of <span class="accented">he</span>, and the form is the infinitive." Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi translate the first clause as above; the former beg, "The sense is, As robber-troops wait for a man who is to pass along the way, that they may plunder him, so is (or so does) the company of the priests;" the latter explains, "As troops of robbers wait for a man passing along the way to plunder him, so is the company of priests, he means to say, as the priests of the high places who combine to plunder those who pass along the way. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> another translation, which, connecting <span class="accented">ish</span> taken collectively with <span class="accented">gedhudhim</span>, and making it the subjective genitive of the infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>, is, "Like the lurking of the men of the gang, s is the company of the priests." This first clause is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> quite misread and not rendered by the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "And thy strength is that of a robber: the priests have hid the way." Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, and for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;</span>. In the second clause we prefer decidedly the translation which is intimated in the margin of the Authorized Version; thus: <span class="accented">Along the way they murder even go Shechem</span>. The word <span class="accented">derekh</span> is an adverbial accusative of place; and Sichem, the present Nablus, was situated on Mount Ephraim between Ebal and Gerizim. It was a Levitical city and a city of refuge; it thus lay on the west as Gilead on the east of Jordan, and both cities, thus perhaps nearly parallel in place on opposite sides of the river, were equal in crime and infamy. The prophet does not tell us who the wayfarers were, or whither they were bound; he only intimates that they fell victims to certain miscreant priests located in these quarters. As this city lay on the main route from the north to Jerusalem, pilgrims to the annual feasts passed along this way. The priests of the calf-win, ship, being in general persons taken from the dregs of the people, waylaid those pilgrims, whether for plunder, or through hostility to the purer worship still maintained in the holy city, or from sheer cruelty. Or it is even possible that the wayfarers referred to may have been persons going from Samaria, the northern capital, to the idolatrous worship at Bethel. In either case, on the way to their destination or on the return journey they were set upon and robbed, or, in the event of resistance, they were murdered. <span class="cmt_word">For they commit lewdness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">yea, they have committed enormity</span>. The <span class="accented">zimmah</span>, or infamy, here mentioned is referred <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some to unnatural wickedness (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>); it is rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a designation of wickedness and abominations in general; thus Kimchi explains it of "evil and abominable work of every kind." He further remarks: "The prophet says, Net this alone have they done; but all their works are <span class="accented">zimmah</span>. And perhaps <span class="accented">zimmah</span> may be explained of thought, as if he said, As they have thought in their heart so they have acted." On this verse generally it may be briefly remarked <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "by consent" of the Authorized Version would require <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;</span> to be joined with "shoulder;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the connection of the first and second clauses in the Authorized Version is much the same with that of Ewald: "And as troops lie in wait the company of priests murder along the way to Sichem." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His explanation is that the priests murdered those that fled by the way before they reached the refuge, perhaps at the command of some leading persons ill disposed towards them.

Further, Israel is not synonymous with the parallel Ephraim, as Keil thinks; the latter is the principal tribe which led the way in Israel's apostasy. The "horrible thing" comprehends every sort of crime and abomination; while the" whoredom," literal or spiritual, is specified as an example thereof. (For the explanation of "there," see on ver. 7.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee.</span> The subject of <span class="accented">shath</span> is the indeterminate third person, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, and our "they" or "one." The third person singular masculine, the third person plural, the second person singular masculine, and the passive voice are all used in this way. So here it is: "One hath appointed (set) a harvest for thee," or "a harvest is appointed for thee." The harvest is either recompense or retribution, and thus it is either good or evil, for as a man sows he maps. The context shows that the reaping here is punishment. Judah had sinned like Israel; and, in the case of both, a seed-time of sin produced a harvest of suffering and sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">When I returned</span> (better, <span class="accented">return, or, restore</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the captivity of my people</span>.

It is as though God said, "Let not Judah claim superiority over Israel, nor expect to escape Divine judgment more than Israel. Each reaps what he sows. When Israel has received the deserved chastisement, Judah's turn shall then come also." The "turning of captivity" is a formula denoting the restoration of the lost fortune or well-being of a people or person; thus <a href="../../par/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>, "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hosea/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hosea 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hosea/7.htm"><title>Hosea 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hosea/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hosea/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hosea/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hosea/6.htm" title="Hosea 6">&#9668;</a> Hosea 7 <a href="../hosea/8.htm" title="Hosea 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <i>and</i> the troop of robbers spoileth without.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - When I would hays healed Israel.

When God would heal, or as often as he proceeded to heal, Israel, the evils broke out afresh, or came more fully to light, just like a wound the dangerous nature of which is discovered by the surgeon's probe in the effort to heal it. <span class="cmt_word">Then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria.</span> The sin of the northern kingdom manifested itself in high quarters - in the premier tribe of Israel, and in the capital city of Samaria. "Because," says Abort Ezra, in his comment, "they said, He hath torn, and he will heal us, he says, When I was disposed to heal them, the wickedness concealed in their heart stood before my face, which they have not left off until the present time, for they practice falsehood; by night they steal, and by day troops (of bandits) spread themselves outside the cities." Similarly, Rashi explains: "When I was willing to help and to heal them, their iniquities manifested themselves before me, for they practiced lying constantly; while thieves of their number entered in continually, and stole the wealth of their companions, and even their gangs spread themselves for robberies to rob men." <span class="cmt_word">For they commit falsehood</span>; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth (margin, <span class="accented">strippeth</span>) without. Here follows an enumeration of the crimes of which they were guilty. There was falsehood, or fraud, or deception generally, and that, not only in words, but in works; next comes dishonesty, both in public and in private. The thief privately entered the houses, and committed burglary; gangs of highwaymen publicly infested the roads, spoiling the passers-by, or rather roamed or spread themselves abroad for plunder, since it is the causative conjugation of <span class="accented">pashat</span> that has the signification of stripping or spoiling others. The thief within, the rubber robs without.

The latter, equivalent to saying "in their heart," which is the usual expression, denotes one's inward thoughts or reasonings with himself; the former, equivalent to saying "to their heart," is an address to, or remonstrance with, the heart with the view of restraining its evil purposes. God's remembrance of wickedness imports its punishment. Now their own doings have beset them about. Their doings <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> have become evident or conspicuous as a robe or garment with which a man is surrounded, or a troop of body-guards placed about him. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the terrors and penal consequences of their sins have surrounded them like a garment, as we elsewhere read, "He clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment." In this latter sense the figure is rather taken from enemies besieging a town or city, and beleaguering it closely all around, or from lictors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> officers of the law surrounding them, or even witnesses confronting them on every side. Kimchi explains the sense as follows: "Now their evil deeds surround them, which were before my face and were not hidden from me; and, while they receive the punishment, they will remember that 1 know all the whole, and that it is I who return their reward upon their head." <span class="cmt_word">They are before my face</span>, in the last clause, has a striking and awe-inspiring parallel in the ninetieth psalm: "Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance." Aben Ezra's exposition is somewhat obscure; it is as follows: "They think that I do not see them, and they do not observe that their actions encircle them, as they are before my face."

Such was the desperate treachery of those miscreant conspirators. This view tallies well with the context.

Similar and yet somewhat peculiar is the concluding portion of Kimchi's comment: "As soon as he lays the pieces of wood into the oven, in order to heat it, he commands the women to knead, and he ceases to stir them (the women) up until the dough is leavened, as he estimates it in his heart, and then he rouses them to come with the dough to bake it. And this is the time when the oven is heated." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> as a noun prefixed with the preposition <span class="accented">rain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and translates the whole as follows: "They are all adulterers, as an oven glowing from flame for hot-baking, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened." The interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of Wunsche differs considerably from both the preceding; it is, "They are all adulterers, like an even, burning from a baker, who <span class="accented">rests while stoking</span> from the kneading of the dough till its fermentation;" and he cites in favor of this view Aben Ezra as follows: "This verse is inverted, and accordingly the sense is: As the oven of a baker burneth from the kneading of the dough till its fermentation, so that the baker can scarcely cease to stir it up, but must stir it up and heat it violently."

The meaning is given by Kimchi in the following comment: "The sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span> is that the one came with his bottle full of wine, and the other with his bottle; and they made the king sick;" and to this there is an exact parallel in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>, "Woe unto him that giveth his neigh-hour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also." In the second clause the expression, "drawing out the hand," is borrowed from drunken carousals, in which the hand is stretched out in asking, receiving, and handing the goblets; or, more simply, according to Pussy, who says, "Men in drink reach out their hands to any whom they meet, in token of their sottish would be friendliness."

Their heart (which is the fact) is heated with evil passion, as an oven (which is the figure) is heated for baking purposes; while they are secretly set for wickedness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Wunsche, after enumerating a great variety of renderings and expositions, with none of which he is satisfied, gives the following: "For they press close together; like an oven is their heart in their artifice (cunning)." The meaning, according to the same author, is that all, scoffers and king alike, press near each other, being of one heart and disposition; cunning makes them one single society. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil translates more simply as follows: "For they have brought their heart into their ambush, as into the oven." In this rendering he combines the explanation of Ewald and Hitzig. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> In the second clause which Keil translates in the same sense as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Authorized Version, Wunsche <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> changes the common reading into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, their anger, and translates accordingly, "All night their anger sleeps, in the morning it burns like flaming fire." That the reading here is somewhat doubtful may be inferred from the fact that the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;</span>: while the Chaldee and Syrian <span class="accented">rugzehon</span>, their fury; still, as it is only a conjectural emendation, we prefer abiding by the ordinary reading and rendering, at least in this instance. The following explanation of the whole verse by Aben Ezra gives a consistent sense: "By <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5dd;</span> are meant their evil purposes, which they devise all night long. And their heart is like an oven, only with the difference that there the baker sleeps the whole night, and only in the morning kindles the oven; but their heart does not sleep at all, but devises evil the whole night." It is curious how Rashi and Kimchi, while giving in the main the same explanation with Aben Ezra, differ from him about the meaning of the sleeping. The former has the following brief comment: "Their baker lights the oven. After they have prepared their heart and thought out the consummation of their wickedness, how they could carry the same into effect, then their baker sleeps, that is, they sleep till morning; at the break of day, however, they burn <span class="accented">like</span> fire, until they have brought their wickedness fully to an end." Kimchi goes into the matter a little more fully, as is usual with him; he comments as follows: "The heart is the instrument of the thought, and the power that works therein is the baker by way of figure. And as the baker lights the oven at night, and in the morning finds that the pieces of wood have burnt out, and he baketh therein the bread, which is the chief end of the work of heating; and lo, the baker sleeps in the night after he has put the pieces of wood into the oven, because he has nothing more to do till the morning. Just so the baker in this figurative sense, which is the power of thought - he sleeps in the night; as if he said he lies there and rests, because the project comes not forth into execution until the morning; and the prophet calls him who thinks sleeping, because that there is no effort of the body in thought, In the morning he burneth, as if he said that they are in flame in the morning to execute the evil which they have devised at night."

They should have thought in their heart, There is no power in the hand of our king to help us out of our distress; we will turn to Jehovah, for he will be our Helper." This verse is not so difficult as the three preceding; we proceed, therefore, in regular order to the next. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-8.htm">Hosea 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span> The people of the northern kingdom had fallen away from Jehovah, and mixed themselves with the heathen nationalities. They resembled a cake which, through neglect of turning, was burnt on the one side and raw on the other. The best commentary on the first clause of this verse is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/106-35.htm">Psalm 106:35, 36</a>, and 39; they "were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.... Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a-whoring with their own inventions." The second clause is well explained by Bishop Horsley as follows: "One thing on one side, another on the other; burnt to a coal at bottom, raw dough at the top. An apt image of a character that is all inconsistencies. Such were the ten tribes of the prophet's day; worshippers of Jehovah in profession, but adopting all the idolatries of the neighboring nations, in addition to their own semi-idolatry of the calves." Similarly, the Geneva Bible has, "Baked on one side and raw on the ether, he is neither through hot nor through cold, but partly a Jew and partly a Gentile." Jehovah had chosen Israel out of the nations of the earth, and given them a special constitution. The object of this segregation was that Israel should be a peculiar people and a holy nation. Thus distinguished, they were to dwell alone; but, ungrateful for this high distinction, and unmindful of their high destiny, they mingled with the nations, learned their heathenish ways, and worshipped their hateful idols. Thus they forfeited their theocratic pre-eminence. While it was their privilege as well u duty to follow the precepts of Jehovah, and serve him with undivided affection, they fell away from his service and adopted the idolatries and habits of the heathen; it was only a just retribution, therefore, when God gave them ever into the hand of those heathen peoples to waste their resources and leave them shorn of their strength. The second clause is the counterpart of this; exactly like the peoples subsequently brought from Assyria, and planted in the lands of the <span class="accented">dispossessed</span> Israelites, they worshipped the Lord, but served their own gods - they were neither true worshippers of Jehovah nor out-and-out followers of Baal. In religion they were <span class="accented">mongrels - inconsistent</span> and worthless hybrids; they were, in fact, what Calvin in rather homely phrase says of them," neither flesh nor <span class="accented">fish</span>." The comment of Kimchi is concise as it is clear: "The prophet means to say, He (Israel) mixes himself among the peoples; though God - blessed be he I - separated them from them, yet they mix them. selves among them and do according to their works." His explanation of the second clause is not so satisfactory when he says, "<span class="accented">As</span> a cake which is baked upon the coals; if they do not turn it, it is burnt below and not baked above, so is the counsel that is not right when they do not turn it from side to side (sense to sense) until they bring it upon their wheels (into action). So (thoughtless and hasty) is Ephraim in his determination to serve the calves and other gods without proving and choosing what is good." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Other explanations need only be referred to in order to be rejected, as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Rashi, who is followed by Grotius. He takes the verb in the future sense: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span> in exile shall be mixed among the peoples." But it is obviously the present, not the future time, that is intended - the present sin, not its future punishment. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the explanation of Aben Ezra, followed by Eichhorn and Maurer, referring to the alliances or treaties which the northern kingdom formed with their neighbors to repel their enemies, and by which the resources of the land were consumed; while the second clause, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> according to Aben Ezra, refers to the over-hastiness and thoughtlessness with which Israel proceeded in their resolutions; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> according to Maurer, Jerome, and Theodoret, it signifies what is spoiled, ill-advised, and worthless. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-9.htm">Hosea 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <i>it</i> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not.</span> Israel's intercourse with other nationalities could not but issue in disaster; a specimen of that disaster is here given. As the Greeks called all who did not speak the Greek language, whether they were savage or civilized, barbarians, so Israel called all foreigners, whether near or far off, strangers. The foreign nations here meant were those with which Israel had entered into treaties or formed alliances, in contravention of the constitution which God had given them. These nations, moreover, devoured their national resources by the imposition of taxes and hostile incursions; thus the King of Syria left "of the people to Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the King of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing;" again, when "Pul, the King of Assyria, came against the laud," we read that Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the King of Assyria;" then, "in the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazer, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. "The <span class="accented">strength</span> here mentioned includes all those things which constitute the wealth and well-being of a country, the produce of the soil and the riches of its inhabitants. Thus Aben Ezra rightly explains this clause, referring it to "the tribute which the Israelites gave to Assyria and Egypt, as is written in the Book of Kings." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, grey hairs are here and there</span> (margin, <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>upon him</span>. What from foreign foes and internal feuds, the body politic was manifesting unmistakable symptoms of decay and decrepitude and approaching dissolution, just as grey hairs on the human body give indication of the advance of old age, with its decay of strength and nearness to the tomb. "The course of nature," says Aben Ezra, "has sprinkled grey hairs upon him, just as grey hair comes on men in consequence of the course of nature;" this corresponds to the sentiment of the preceding clause, for, according to the commentator just named," the grey hair denotes that their power is weakened and their possession perished." <span class="cmt_word">Yet he knoweth not is parallel to</span>. "And he knoweth (it) not," and repeats the same sentiment, of course with emphasis of what was Israel thus ignorant? Not, surely, of the declining state of the national strength and the decay of the national importance. After so many drains upon their resources and the unsatisfactory position of their foreign relations, they could not shut their eyes upon the steadily and even rapidly approaching decadence. But though they could not pretend ignorance of the fact, they remained in ignorance of the cause, its consequence, and the cure. Notwithstanding the already exhausted condition of their country, and the process of exhaustion still going on, they overlooked the lamentable cause of all, which was their sin, national and individual, in departing from the Lord; and at the same time the dangerous consequences that were neither remote nor capable of being staved off; as also the only possible cure to be found in direct and immediate return and application to that God from whom they had so revolted. The "it" supplied in the Authorized Version <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> had better be omitted; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the construction adopted by Rashi and others, who make the first part of each clause the object of the second, is erroneous, as we have shown in the preceding observations. "They took it not to heart that the kings of Syria consumed them in the days of Jehoahaz" is the exposition of Rashi just referred to; but that of Kimchi favors the first and correct construction, as may be inferred from the words, "And he (Israel) knows not that on account of his iniquity all this has come upon him, and yet he turns not from his wickedness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-10.htm">Hosea 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek him for all this</span> (<span class="accented">amid all this</span>). If with Keil and others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we understand "the pride of Israel" to mean Jehovah the glory of Israel, and take the verb in the sense of "testify," the meaning will be that Jehovah bore witness to the face of Israel by the weakening and wasting of their kingdom, as portrayed in the preceding verse. We prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to understand "the pride of Israel" in the souse of "the haughtiness" of Israel, and the verb in the sense of "being humbled," as at <a href="../../par/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>. The real meaning, then, is expressed in the following rendering: <span class="accented">And the haughtiness of Israel shall be humbled to his face</span>. This humiliation is the effect of the wasting mentioned in the preceding verse; while the evidence of their humiliation is specified in the succeeding verse by their resorting to Egypt and repairing to Assyria from a consciousness of their helplessness. This rendering is countenanced by the LXX., both here and at <a href="../../par/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; while Rashi says, "The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d2;&#x5d4;</span> has the meaning of "humiliation." <span class="accented">For all this</span>. This emphasizes the obstinate blindness and perverseness of Ephraim, when, amid all the calamities and miseries of the kingdom both within and without, they turned not to Jehovah to solicit help and deliverance, but concluded treaties or made alliances with foreign nations in hope of being lifted up out of their national impotence. On this Aben Ezra makes the judicious remark: "They turned not to Jehovah as paupers who have nothing more to give foreign nations that they may help them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a></div><div class="verse">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart.</span> The silliness of the dove, with which the stupidity of Ephraim is compared, is not manifested by its missing its nest and resting-place, and then helplessly fluttering about, according to Ewald; nor by its falling into the net of the bird-catcher in its effort to escape from the hawk, according to Hitzig; nor by its neither grieving nor searching for its young when it is robbed of them, according to Jerome; nor by its becoming dejected or devoid of consideration when it has lost its young, according to the Targum; but by its flying right into the net of the bird-catcher, without suspecting or observing it in its search for food, according to Rosenm&uuml;ller. Thus Kimchi explains it: "The prophet compares Ephraim to a dove which gets caught in a net owing to its simplicity, because it has no sense to perceive that, when it goes to gather grains of corn, a net is spread there to catch it. So Ephraim, when they went and asked help from Assyria or from Egypt, (did not perceive) that they went to their hurt, when they sought help from the foreign nations and not from God - blessed be he! - in whose hand all is. And he mentions the dove, though it is the manner of other birds, because the dove has no bitterness, as if it went in simplicity and without apprehension of the evil that would come upon it." <span class="cmt_word">They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</span> The position of Palestine exposed its inhabitants to attacks from the two great rival powers of Egypt and Assyria, or Babylon. "It stood midway," says Stanley, "between the two great seats of ancient empire, Babylon and Egypt. It was on the high-road from one to the other of these mighty powers, the prize for which they contended, the battlefield on which they fought, the lofty bridge over which they ascended and descended respectively into the deep basins of the Nile and Euphrates." Accordingly the rulers of the people sought help, now from Egypt to strengthen them against the oppression of Assyria; at another time they sought to secure the support of Assyria. The most powerful enemy of the northern kingdom was Assyria, which distressed that kingdom more and more, until at last they made an end of it. "But," says Kimchi, "while they think to obtain help by them (Egypt and Assyria), they fall into the net of the Almighty - blessed be he - and this is what he says (in the following verse). <span class="cmt_word">As they go I spread my net over them."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-12.htm">Hosea 7:12</a></div><div class="verse">When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they shall go, l will spread my net over them.</span> Threats of punishment are contained in this and the following verses. He begins by the application of the comparison of Ephraim to a dove. Exactly as a dove in its silliness falls into the net set by the fowler, so Israel runs into the net of destruction in seeking help from Egypt and Assyria. The literal rendering is, according <span class="accented">as they go</span>, or, <span class="accented">whatsoever way they shall go</span>. God threatens to spread a net over them, from which there can be no escape. The chief aim of Hebrew sovereigns and rulers was to defend themselves from Egypt by the help of Assyria, or from Assyria by the aid of Egypt; in either case God threatens to spread over them the net of destruction as the bird-catcher. The application to one or other of these powers God forbade, but when they go to either for relief, the result is sure to prove fatal. The image of a net is frequent in Ezekiel; so in Job, he "hath compassed me with his net." <span class="cmt_word">I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven</span>. The comparison with birds and bird-catching continues. Though their sunward soaring flight be high as the eagle's, or rapid as the soft swift wing of the dove, they cannot outspeed or escape the hand of God, but shall be brought down to earth. Or the idea may be that, swiftly as a bird of prey swoops down out of the free air of heaven upon its quarry on the low-lying earth, Jehovah will bring Israel down out of the air of freedom into the net of captivity. Thus in <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a> we read, "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord;" likewise in <a href="../../par/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>, "Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down." <span class="cmt_word">I will chastise them as their congregation hath heard.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> is an anomalous Hiph. instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, that is, <span class="accented">yod</span> mobile instead of <span class="accented">yod</span> quiescent or diphthongal <span class="accented">zere</span>. The literal rendering makes the meaning more obvious; it is: "I will chastise them according to the tidings [or,' announcement '] to their congregation." In the Law and by the prophets it was repeatedly declared that judgments would fall upon the disobedient and rebellions. As specimens of such announcements, we may refer to <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-35</a> The prophet now assures Ephraim that the judgments so frequently and forcibly announced to the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness, and repeated in subsequent times by the prophets, would be executed on the rebellious rigorously, and in exact accordance with those many previous denunciations. Kimchi has the following comment: "I will assemble them through the chastisement of the peoples, as I announced to their assembly in the wilderness words of chastisement, which are written in the Law, if they will not hearken to the words of the Law." The LXX. may have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>, as their rendering is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "'I will chasten them <span class="accented">with the</span> rumor <span class="accented">of their</span> (coming) <span class="accented">affliction</span>,"

The thought of coming chastisement calls forth the exclamation of woe; while the second exclamation fixes the character and explains the nature of that woe denounced. In neither case does <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> need to be supplied; the opposite expression is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> In assigning the reason, there is a retrospective reference to the figures of the two immediately preceding verses. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> with rain is employed in relation to birds which, when scared from their nest, fly away. Kimchi thinks it applies to the abstention or withdrawal of the Israelites from Divine service in the national sanctuary in Jerusalem. His comment is: "They fly from me, from the service of the house of my sanctuary, to the service of the calves; and this is a breach of faith and defection from me." The LXX. translate the beginning of the second clause freely by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "they are cowards;" and Jerome by "miseri (maticulose) erunt, et semper timentis ac formidantes." The cause assigned is their breaking covenant with God, which is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, literally, "to break away from," "tear one's self loose from." <span class="cmt_word">Though I have redeemed them</span>. This first part of the last clause is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a past by some, as Jerome, who refers it to the redemption from Egypt; thus also the Chaldee: "And I was their Deliverer." Rosenm&uuml;ller approves of this, but, instead of restricting it to the deliverance from Egypt, includes their recent deliverance from the Syrians by Jeroboam II. It is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> better rendered in a voluntative or optative sense: "I would (should like) to redeem them, but they speak lies against (or, concerning) me." The verb '<span class="accented">ephdem</span> cannot with any propriety be taken for a preterit. Yet they have spoken lies against me; rather, <span class="accented">but they on their part have spoken lies con</span>cerning me. The prophet had already charged them with lying at ver. 3, and previously at <a href="../../par/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; but their lies were not confined to their intercourse or dealings with their fellow-men; they spoke lies <span class="accented">against</span> or, as the preposition sometimes signifies, <span class="accented">concerning</span> God. The lies in question included, no doubt, a denial of his essential Deity or sole Divinity; of his power or willingness either to protect or punish. Or they might consist in their falsehood in drawing near to God with their lips without either true faith or real affection in their hearts; some were directly opposed to the claims of Jehovah, some insincere in his service, and others turned aside to the idolatry of the calves - all, with probably some honorable exceptions, had proved false to his covenant with Israel. The last clause has been taken <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> independently by Ewald, without any considerable alteration of the sense: "I, for my part, would redeem them, but they, on their side, speak lies against me." Other acceptations, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> interrogative and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> conditional, evidently mistake the sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole clause is correctly explained by Kimchi thus: "<span class="accented">It</span> was in my heart to redeem them out of their distress; but they speak lies against me, while they say that I know nothing nor exercise any providential care over their actions, whether their actions are good or bad. Therefore I have withdrawn my providential oversight, and have hidden my face from them, and they shall be consumed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, <i>and</i> they rebel against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds.</span> This clause may be more correctly rendered, <span class="accented">They did not cry to me in their heart</span>, <span class="accented">but howl upon their beds</span>. Their falsehood manifested itself in works as well as words; a practical example is here given. They did not, in reality, seek help from God; if they sought at all, it was insincerely. They cried to God, but that cry did not proceed from their heart. They gave vent to their feelings of distress by howlings upon their beds; but those howlings were the expression of unbelief and despair, not by any means evidences of faith. "They do not cry to me," says Aben Ezra, "as the sick man cries to the physician." The comment of Kimchi is still fuller and more explicit: "They have not cried to me in their heart, because of their notion that I do not see their cry nor know what is good or bad for them; but they howl upon their beds, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when they are upon their bed and when they think of that misfortune which is coming upon them. They howl and weep because of their evil case, and do not think that the evil falls on them from me, because they have broken faith with me." The form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is correctly explained by Gesenius as future Hiph. with preformative put before the third person, the <span class="accented">yod</span> of the simple form being superficially taken to belong to the stem. His derivation from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, God, as if a cry to him for help, is incorrect; it is really an onomatopoetic word. <span class="cmt_word">They assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</span> What this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> assembling of themselves was does not clearly appear; whether it was in the market-place or elsewhere to purchase corn in time of famine, as some think; or in idol-temples to propitiate their deities, like the Roman <span class="accented">supplicatio</span> or <span class="accented">lectiosternium</span>, <span class="accented">as others</span> suppose; or for the performance of some extra rite of worship to Jehovah; or for the purpose of plunder in a season of scarcity; or generally their assembling in knots and crowds to discuss anxiously and lament despairingly the distressed state of the country; - their chief design and highest aim being a good supply of corn and wine, that is, the supply of mere bodily wants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span>, as their rendering is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, equivalent to "they cut themselves," or" pined for corn and wine;" corresponding to which rendering is Cyril's exposition: "As enthusiasts and fanatics making incisions with steel in their breasts and both hands, and absurdly all but shedding in sacrifice their own blood, perhaps to graven images." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome, taking the verb from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to ruminate, translates accordingly: "super triticum et vinum ruminabant." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Syriac, tracing it to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to be afraid, translates: "They feared (or, were fearfully anxious) about corn and wine." The common reading and rendering are clearly preferable; Kimchi's exposition is in harmony therewith: "When corn or new wine comes into the city for sale, they all assemble at (or, round) it on account of the famine which is in the city; and yet they fall away from me." The construction of the last clause is pregnant, that is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "they turn aside (and turn) against me." Here, again <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the LXX. seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, to which their translation, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, equivalent to "they were instructed by me," corresponds. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/7-15.htm">Hosea 7:15</a></div><div class="verse">Though I have bound <i>and</i> strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I have bound</span> (margin, <span class="accented">chastened</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</span> The first clause of this verse is more accurately translated as follows: <span class="accented">And yet I have instructed</span>, <span class="accented">have strengthened their arms</span>. Here we have another instance of God's goodness and Israel's ingratitude. He had done much for them, and would fain have done more; and yet the return they made was devising mischief against him. The arms are the seat and symbol of strength, as the hands and fingers symbolize skill; thus, in reference to the latter the psalmist says, "Blessed be the Lord my Strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight;" and with regard to the former he says, "He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms." Two benefits are here included in the prophet's enumeration. He instructed the arms, by which is meant that he showed them how and where to get strength. But this was not all; he not only directed to the source, and taught the secret of acquiring strength, he actually supplied strength, thereby giving them power to contend against and conquer their enemies. At a time when "there was not any shut up, nor any left [that is, 'neither bond nor free'] nor helper for Israel...  the Lord...  saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash." Notwithstanding all this, they <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> acted the part of apostates and rebels against him: they devised mischief against him by their idolatry which denied him the Godhead glory which was his due, and by their rebellion which aimed at depriving him of his kingly power and dignity. The reference of the last clause, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to Ewald, is to the treaties which Israel entered into with Assyria and Egypt for safety and defense; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> according to Kimchi, to Israel's false representations of the government and providence of Jehovah: "For they say the good or evil does not come to them from me, but is purely accidental." With respect to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5e8;</span>, it must be borne in mind that, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;</span>, it has two meanings, viz. the chastisement of punishment (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) and the chastisement of love (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>).

Their God-defying attitude, as described in ver. 15, is represented in ver. 16 allegorically as a deceitful bow, which fails to scud the arrow to the mark; also their unsuccess is represented as exposing them to the derision of Egypt; while the princes who spake so exceeding proudly, and who instigated their ungodliness and consequent wretchedness, would be slain with the sword.

They disappointed the high hopes raised, and missed their own high destiny, and thus they resembled a bow, of which the string, losing its elasticity, could not propel the arrow to the object aimed at. Appearing to return to the worship of Jehovah, they turned aside to an idol. Thus in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a>, they "turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hosea/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hosea 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 8"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hosea/8.htm"><title>Hosea 8 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hosea/8.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hosea/8.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hosea/8-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hosea/7.htm" title="Hosea 7">&#9668;</a> Hosea 8 <a href="../hosea/9.htm" title="Hosea 9">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Set</i> the trumpet to thy mouth. <i>He shall come</i> as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The exclamation in this verse, <span class="cmt_word">A trumpet to thy mouth,</span> supersedes the necessity of supplying a verb. The alarm of war or of hostile invasion is to be sounded by the prophet at the command of Jehovah. The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> trumpet is at once to be employed for the purpose. The rendering of both the Targum and Syriac <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> expresses the same idea, though under a different form; the former has, "Cry with thy throat, as if it were a trumpet;" and the latter, "Let thy mouth be as a trumpet." According to this view, the Prophet Hoses expresses here very briefly what Isaiah has done more fully in the words, "Cry aloud [Hebrew, 'with the throat'] spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. here deviates considerably from the Maseoretic Hebrew text, translating <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>, of the meaning of which Jerome acknowledges his ignorance, though he attempts to explain it. Cyril connects the words with the concluding part of the preceding chapter, thus: "This their setting at naught (of me) in the land of Egypt shall come into their own bosom. As the land, as the eagle against the house of the Lord;" while his explanation is as follows: "Since, though I preserved them and instructed them, and gave them victory over their enemies (for I strengthened them), they have impiously set me at naught, worshipping demons for gods, and have trusted to the land of the Egyptians, and have fancied that their help shall be sufficient for their prosperity, therefore their attempt shall return unto their own besom, and they shall find no good reward of their temerity; but they shall receive, as it were, into their bosom the deserved punishment. For he shall come, he shall come who shall lay them waste - the King of Assyria, with an innumerable multitude of warriors, and he shall come to them as the whole land and region and country, that one might think that the whole region of the Persians and Medes had wholly migrated and had come into Samaria. This is the meaning of the whole land (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>). He shall likewise come as an eagle into the house of the Lord." (He shall come) <span class="cmt_word">as an eagle against the house of the Lord.</span> These words cannot mean, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as Hitzig thinks, the rapidity with which the prophet is directed to convey his tidings of alarm, as if it were, "Fly [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> imperfect being supplied], thou prophet, as an eagle;" nor yet, with others, the loudness of the alarm he was to sound. The meaning abruptly though vividly expressed refers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the approaching invasion of the enemy, though there is no need to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, It is the substance of the prophet's alarm. As an eagle the enemy (as is evident flora ver. 3) shall come against the house of the Lord. The enemy was, in all probability, the Assyrian, in whose symbolism the eagle bulks largely; while the griffin vulture, scenting from afar, and coming down with rapid and terrific swoop upon its prey, is an appropriate image of the sudden and impetuous character of his invasion. The house of the Lord is neither the temple at Jerusalem, for the prophecy relates to the northern kingdom; nor the temple at Samaria, which could not be called <span class="accented">Beta Yehovah</span>, but <span class="accented">Bethbamoth</span>; nor the land of Israel, which could not with any propriety be called a house; but the people of Israel, which, owing to God's covenant relation to that people, is called his house, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house." The figure seems an echo of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, "The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth;" while it has a parallel in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>, "For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together." <span class="cmt_word">Because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my Law.</span> These words exhibit the cause of Israel's being exposed to the sudden hostile attack which the prophet was commissioned to proclaim. The provocations of Israel consisted in violating the covenant which God had been pleased to make with them, and in proving unfaithful to that Law, obedience to which was the condition of the covenant. The explanation of the whole verse thus given is confirmed by the Hebrew commentators; thus Rashi says, "The Shechinah (or Divine Majesty)says to the prophet, 'Let the voice of thy palate be heard and sound the trumpet and say, The enemies fly hither as the eagle flieth and come unto the house of the Lord.'" Abeu Ezra more concisely conveys the same sense: "It is the words of Jehovah to the prophet, ' Set the cornet to thy palate, for the enemy flieth as the eagle against the house of the Lord.'" Kimchi differs in two respects from his brethren, understanding the address to be not that of Jehovah to the prophet, but of the prophet to the people; and the house of the Lord to include the whole laud of Israel and temple at Jerusalem: "The cornet to thy palate, as he said above, 'Sound the trumpet in Gibeah.' Many a time the prophet speaks to the people in the singular and many a time in the plural. He says, 'Put the trumpet to thy mouth, for behold! the enemy flies hither like the eagle over the house of Jehovah; 'he means to say,' Over the whole land and also over the house of Jehovah, in order to destroy it.' And he joins the trumpet to the palate (and yet man sets the trumpet to the mouth) because the voice passes over the way of the palate after it comes out of the throat."

Thus the Chaldee paraphrase has: "As often as calamity comes upon them they pray and say before me, Now we acknowledge that we have no God beside thee; deliver us, because we are thy people Israel." As to the construction, either "Israel" is in apposition to <span class="accented">anachnu</span>, the subject of the verb, or there is a transposition. Thus Rashi: "We must transpose the words, and explain, ' To me, cries Israel, My God, we know thee; '" so also Kimchi and Aben Ezra.

The word "Israel" is omitted by the LXX. and Syriac, and in many manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi.

The good which Israel rejected is not exactly God the One Good, nor Jehovah the greatest Good, nor the Law, which was good; but all the goodness which he bestows on such as keep his covenant. This Israel rejected, and in turn is rejected of God and delivered up into the hands of his pursuers.

Their conduct was not guided by Divine direction, nor in obedience to the Divine will, nor with the Divine sanction. This state of things began with Israel's revolt from the house of David, and rebellion against the son of Solomon their legitimate sovereign, and was repeated in subsequent usurpations. Perhaps we may go further back, even to the appointment of the first king of the yet undivided kingdom, when "the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." Usurpations such as those of Zimri, Omri, and Shallum at least are comprehended in the appointments referred to - appointments on making which the people did not inquire of the Lord, nor act under his guidance, nor seek his sanction. Some go so far as to include all the kings of Israel that succeeded Jeroboam. Thus Cyril says, "He denies the kingdom of Israel and his successors on the throne of Israel." Aben Ezra also extends the statement to the kings of the northern kingdom from the days of Jeroboam: "They inquired not of God with respect to the making of Jeroboam king, although it is written, ' Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose.'" A seeming contradiction here exists between the statement of the prophet here and that in <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-37.htm">1 Kings 11:37</a>, where God promises by the Prophet Ahijah, "I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel," and the fact of Jehu's anointing being ordered by the Prophet Elisha, who sent one of the children of the prophets for that purpose with the words, "Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel." The plotting of Jeroboam, and the conspiracy of Jehu against Joram, and the conspiracies of other usurpers, were things which God could not approve; and so we must distinguish between the permission and approval of Jehovah; in his government he permits many things which from his nature we know he does not and cannot approve. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> is usually and properly rendered, "they have made princes;" but Aben Ezra and Rashi translate it as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> equivalent to "they have removed;" while the Massora reckon <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> in the number of those words which are written with <span class="accented">shin</span> but are read and explained with <span class="accented">samech</span>. Some manuscripts also of Kennicett and De Rossi have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>. Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they (literally, <span class="accented">it</span>) may be cut off. This is a second proof of Israel's renunciation of Jehovah. They used their gold in making the idolatrous calves, and their silver in supporting their idolatrous worship; or they made the idol-calves, some of silver, and others of gold. The consequence rather than the purpose is the destruction of it, namely, the gold and silver; or the ruin of the kingdom or of each member of it; or the cutting off of their name, according to Kimchi. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in Greek, is generally relic, denoting "purpose;" nor is it <span class="accented">ecbatic</span> here, denoting "result," though, according to the Hebrew mode of thought, design and consequence often coincide. Its meaning here is well explained by Keil, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> describes the consequence of this conduct, which, though not designed, was nevertheless inevitable, as if it had been distinctly intended."

The meaning of (b) is plain, the import being that the idol-worship had led to the rejection and so the withdrawal of Jehovah; while the sense of (a) conveys the idea that the golden calf which the country represented by its capital and the government had established at Bethel as the symbol of their worship, so far from protecting its worshippers, would fall itself into the hands of the Assyrian invader. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to "Cast off [as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>] thy calf, O Samaria;" which is  an exhortation to Samaria, and not only Samaria, but the entire country, with the inhabitants of the capital at its head, to cast aside the calf-worship by which they had incurred the wrath of the Almighty. Jerome, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5bb;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (Pual), renders, "Cast off is thy calf." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some modern scholars translate, "He has cast off thy calf," and refer it to the enemy, and rather in the sense of carrying off the golden image as a spoil; or to Jehovah; thus De Wette has, "[Jehova] verwirft deiu Calb, Samarien," which is not in keeping with the first person in the next clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Others take the verb intransitively, and give it the meaning of "smelling bodily," "emitting intolerable stench." "being loathsome or disgusting;" thus Keil has, "Thy calf disgusts, O Samaria." So Wunsche: "Anekolt deiu Calb." Israel loathed or felt disgust at pure worship and what was really good; now Jehovah in turn is disgusted with their golden calf and hateful idolatry. No wonder it is added, <span class="accented">Mine anger is waxed hot</span> (has burnt or blazed out) <span class="accented">against them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the calf and Samaria, nor the calves, but their stupid, sinful worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">How long will it be ere they attain to innocence?</span> Or it may be translated, <span class="accented">How long will it be ere they shall be able to endure</span> (bear) <span class="accented">innocence</span> (guiltlessness)? The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span>, has frequently to be supplemented by another verb, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, "A proud heart will not I suffer;" so also <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. The speaker here turns, as it were, from unwilling auditors to others more ready to lend ancar, and asks, "How long are they incapable of purity of life instead of the abominations of idolatry? How great the madness that, while I allow space and place for repentance, they are unwilling to return to soundness of mind! " The Authorized Version rendering is supported by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. The former explains: "It is as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> were written double, ' Thee as thy calf cast off - thee Samaria, as if it has rejected thee, for the city shall be laid and its inhabitants shall go into captivity;'" and Kimchi says, "<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> is transitive, and has the meaning of ' remove,' as in <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>. He says, 'O Samaria, thy calf has removed thee,' that is, on account of it thou art removed out of thy land." The last clause is also well explained by Kimchi, though in a different sense from that given above, thus: "How long are they unable to purify themselves from this guilt (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. idolatry)?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">For from Israel <i>was</i> it also: the workman made it; therefore it <i>is</i> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For from Israel was it also: the workman made it;</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore it is not God</span>. The prophet here vindicates the justness of Jehovah's complaint and the folly of Israel's conduct. The first clause points out the orion of this idolatry - this god of gold was out of Israel, it proceeded from them and was invented by their kings. The second clause shows that it was of human manufacture; while the natural inference follows in the third clause to the effect that, having its origin with man and being made by man, it could not be God. Or if the rendering, "Thy calf disgusts," be adopted, the <span class="accented">ki</span> introduces the explanation of the disgust which that abomination caused. This idol was of home manufacture, not imported from abroad, as Baal and Ashtaroth from the Sidoniaus, Chemosh from the Moabites, and Moloch from the Ammonites. The Israelites themselves and their king Jeroboam made for the northern kingdom what had been learnt in Egypt. Thus Israel's god was a creature of Israel's own devising. How stupid and how absurd! Israel's god man-made, how enormous and abominable the iniquity! <span class="cmt_word">But the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span> It shall become splinters; the <span class="accented">hapaz legomenon</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is derived from an Arabic root, <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to cut; and thus, as the calf at Sinai was burnt and pulverized, the calf of Samaria shall be broken into splinters and destroyed. The whole verse is well explained by Kimchi: "Now ye will see if the calf is able to deliver its worshippers; it cannot even deliver itself, for it shall become splinters, as if he said that the enemies shall break it up and carry it away for the worth of the gold, not for any utility that is in it while it is still in the form of a calf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (broken pieces, shivers), fragments." The Septuagintal rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, is probably due to the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <a href="../../par/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>, "turning away." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.</span> The harvest corresponds to the seed-time; their foolish and vain idolatries shall have corresponding results. This proverbial expression imports more than merely labor in vain; it denotes labor that has an injurious and destructive result. It has more than a negative significancy of lost labor; it conveys the idea of positive detriment. "The prophet," says Kimchi, "means to say that they will weary themselves in vain in this service (of idols), just as if a man who sows the wind, in which there is nothing substantial, shall only reap the wind, or even still less; as if he had said, ' Ye shall not obtain the least enjoyment, but only injury.'" If, then, the wind denote the vanity and nothingness of human effort, the whirlwind is the image of destruction and annihilation, viz. a storm or hurricane remorselessly tearing all away with it. <span class="accented">Suphah</span> itself intensifies the notion included in ruach, while the paragogic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> intensifies  still more, so as to denote a storm of greatest violence. The double feminine ending is regarded by most as strengthening the sense in this word <span class="accented">suphathah</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">It hath no stalk</span> (margin, <span class="accented">standing corn</span>): the bud shall yield no meal; better, <span class="accented">shoot brings no fruit</span>. This is a further development of the figure. When wind is the seed sown, destruction represented by tempest is the harvest reaped. The seed sown produces no stalk, or at least no stall  =   with grain in it - no standing corn. If the seed shoot up at all, the shoot has no fruit. Here the play on words, of which the Hebrews were so fond, is obvious - the <span class="accented">tse-roach</span> has no <span class="accented">yemach</span>; the halm has no maim; the <span class="accented">Spross</span> no <span class="accented">Schoss</span>; the corn no kern. <span class="cmt_word">If so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</span> When, or if, any fruit is attained, the invasion of rapacious foreigners swallows it up. First, then, when the wind of vain human efforts is the sowing, destruction is the harvest. If the seed spring up at all, the ear does not fill; or if the ear should fill, there is no substance in it; or if it fill and have substance, the rapacity of hostile invaders consumes it. Thus a blight falls on all they do. Kimchi explains the verse fully as follows: "Because the prophet compares their works to one who <span class="accented">sows</span> the wind, he adds further to the same image, and says, 'It has no stalk, it reaches not the time when it shall be stalk' (or 'standing corn'). Now <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> is the name of the corn when it stands ready for the harvest, from which the husbandmen (literally, 'sowers') soon expect enjoyment, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. after harvest, when they shall make it into meal. Yea, even at the time they expect profit from their works, they shall have none. And he <span class="accented">says</span> further, 'The shoot shall not produce fruit or meal,' as if he said, ' Even should the seed spring up after the sowing.' He thus represents in a figure that should they prosper a little in their works after they have begun to do evil, yet that prosperity will not last, and it will not come to perfect enjoyment (beauty) like corn which comes to harvest and to grinding. And if it should yield, strangers devour it. Perhaps for a time it may produce so as to come to meal, as if he said that, should they prosper in their <span class="accented">possessions</span> so that a little enjoyment should be accorded to them at the first, then strangers shall come and devour it, and their enjoyment will not be complete."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a></div><div class="verse">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</span> All their misery and misfortune they have brought upon themselves. They have prepared this fate for themselves, and made themselves meet for their fate. The second clause is correctly rendered, <span class="accented">a wild ass goes alone by itself</span>; <span class="accented">and</span> this clause is an independent statement - not connected by n- of comparison either with the clause preceding nor with the succeeding one. Instead of saying that Epraim, that is, Israel, went up to Assyria like a stubborn wild ass alone by itself, or that like a wild ass going alone Ephraim hired (sued for) lovers, the statement stands independent and in a measure detached, the meaning being that even a wild ass, stupid and stubborn as that animal is, keeps by itself to secure its independence. The conduct of Israel, however, appears to disadvantage in contrast with that of a stupid wild ass; it is more stupid and senseless; their folly is seen by the comparison: it maintained its independence by going alone, Ephraim lost independence by soliciting help from heathen allies. What, then, was the object to the attainment of which this foolish conduct was directed? In other words, why did Israel go on this stupid mission to Assyria? What did they seek to gain by it? The third clause contains the answer: they sought help and succor from the <span class="accented">Assyrians</span>. Thus the first clause, giving a reason for their calamity, shows it was self-procured by Ephraim going up to Assyria; the second clause exposes the folly of such conduct in seeking prohibited and pernicious foreign alliances; the third clause specifies the precise object of Ephraim's sinful and foolish mission, namely, the procuring of succor from <span class="accented">Assyria</span>. The above explanation, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> which is in substance Keil's, and which is a contrast between the independence of the wild ass and Ephraim's servile suing for foreign help, is, we think, simpler and more correct than <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the common one, which is a comparison of the willfulness, waywardness, and wantonness of the wild ass roaming solitarily by itself with Ephraim's willful waywardness in going up to Assyria for succor, and wantonness in suing for  idolatrous alliances. The expression, "<span class="accented">going</span> <span class="accented">up</span>," alludes to going to the interior of the country, or to the capital of the monarch Assyria now owned as sovereign, or to a place of refuge. The hiring of lovers, or lover, by Ephraim stigmatizes their shameful conduct as that of a shameless harlot, who, instead of receiving, bestows presents on lovers, or as the reward of endearments.

And they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. This fixes with more definiteness the meaning of the foregoing member of the verse.

Our choice must lie between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in interpreting this difficult clause; there is a modification of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> worth mentioning; it is: "They shall in a little while sorrow for the burden which they pay (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the tribute which they pay) kings and princes," viz. all of them, the two concluding words being thus in apposition to the subject of the verb. On the whole, we prefer there rendering of the clause in the Authorized Version, as both grammatical and supplying a sense consistent with the context. The prophet foretells that Israel would ere long feel painfully the sorrowful consequences of their going to Assyria and suing there for help. Oppressed by a yearly tribute to the Assyrian king, they would smart under the yoke, and long to be free. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a></div><div class="verse">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - These two verses are closely connected with the preceding verse and with each other. Ver. 11 not only accounts for, but justifies, the threat of punishment announced in ver. 10 by reference to Ephraim's sin; and ver. 12 shows the inexcusableness of Ephraim in thus sinning. <span class="cmt_word">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</span> Instead of the one sanctuary with its altar in the place which the Lord their God would choose out of all their tribes to put his Name there and to accept the offerings of his people, they multiplied altars contrary to the express command of God; while those altars which they erected in any places that pleased them were not for the service of the true God, but for the worship of idols, the calves, Baal, and ether vanities of the heathen. Thus they multiplied their sin by every altar they reared and every idol they worshipped. Their altars, instead of proving their piety, plunged them in greater sin and deeper guilt. <span class="cmt_word">I have written to him the great things of my Law,</span> but they <span class="cmt_word">were counted as a strange thing.</span> For the Athenians, whose city Paul found full of idols, and which in addition to its many other altars had one to an unknown god, there was some excuse, for they were not privileged with a revelation of the Divine will in a written Law; but for Israel no such apology was possible. This verse proves plainly that, in their sinning by multiplying idols and altars, they were entirely without excuse. The kethie or textual reading has <span class="accented">ribbo</span> for <span class="accented">ribboth</span> by the omission of tar and equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, that is, ten thousand, or myriads; the Qeri or Maasoretie correction, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;</span>, multitudes. The idea conveyed is the numerous directions, preceptive and prohibitive, of the Pentateuch; the commandments, so full and explicit, comprehending alike the great things and the little; the details, so minute as well as manifold, that there was no possibility of mistake, provided there was any mind to be informed. Still more, these commandments, directions, and details were not only communicated verbally and orally to Israel; they were committed to writing, and thus placed permanently on record. And yet, notwithstanding all this, the great things of God's Law were regarded by many or most of those to whom they were addressed as instructions foreign to their interest, with which they had no concern, and which consequently had no claim on their attention and deserved no place in their recollection. The variety of names for the Divine commands is very noteworthy. There are <span class="accented">commandments</span> equivalent to all precepts of which the motives are assigned, as of circumstance to distinguish Israel from ether people; <span class="accented">statutes</span>, for which no motives are assigned, as in the case of the red heifer, prohibition against wearing garments of mixed material, and ceremonial prescripts in general; <span class="accented">testimonies</span>, precepts intended to keep up the memory of any event of fact as the Passover to remind of the departure from Egypt; <span class="accented">precepts</span>, rational injunctions, left, so to say, to our intelligence, as the unity of the Deity and the fact of his being the Creator; and <span class="accented">judgments</span>, judicial directions relating to buying and selling, inheritances, and such like.

We prefer the former, for their faithlessness and foul idolatry were sufficient reasons to prevent Israel indulging in the joy of harvest. The blessings of the harvest were regarded by them as rewards for the worship of their idol-gods, in other words, as gifts from Baalim and Ashtaroth or other idols, and thus as <span class="accented">ethnan</span>, a harlot's hire; not as tokens and pledges of the favor of Jehovah.

The floor and press - whether wine-prom, or rather oil-press, as the mention of new wine follows - are put for their contents by a common figure of speech. The expression, "fail in her," is literally, "lie to her," and has many parallels; as, "The labor of the olive shall fail [margin, 'lie']," and Horace's "fundus mendax," equivalent to "a farm that belies his hopes." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean <i>things</i> in Assyria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not dwell in the Lord's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.</span> The Lord's land was Canaan, which Jehovah chose to dwell there by visible symbol of the Shechinah-glory, and which he gave to Israel as his people.

The remaining clauses of the verse may be understood either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ephraim would return to Egypt to obtain anxiliaries, but to no purpose, - for they would be carried away captive and be compelled to eat unclean things in the land of Assyria; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the prophet threatens that some of them would go as exiles into Egypt, and others of them into Assyria This latter explanation is much to be preferred; while with regard to Egypt the threats, ring thus understood would re-echo an crier prophecy in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>, "The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you." In Assyria also they would be obliged to cat things ceremonially unclean, as it would be impossible to conform to the requirements of the Law, according to which the eating of certain animals was prohibited. There is yet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> another interpretation, which takes Assyria to be the place of exile, while Egypt figuratively represents the condition of that exile, namely, a state of hard bondage and sore oppression, such as Israel endured in Egypt in the days of yore. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/9-4.htm">Hosea 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">They shall not offer wine <i>offerings</i> to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices <i>shall be</i> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them the broad of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted</span>. Having predicted their inability to observe the ritual distinctions between clean and unclean, which the Law prescribed, whether from the tyranny of their oppressors or from scarcity, or from the absence of sanctification by the presentation of the firstfruits, the prophet proceeds to predict their cessation altogether. Such is the prophet's picture of their miserable position in Assyria. It is aptly remarked by Grotius that "they failed to pour out libations to the Lord when they could; now the time shall come when they may wish to make such libations, but cannot." According to the Massoretic punctuation and the common rendering, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> which is that of the Authorized Version, the people themselves are the subject of the second verb. They were neither able to offer drink offerings, a part for the whole of the meat offerings and unbloody oblations; nor, if they did, could they hope for acceptance for them away from the sanctuary and its central altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig supplies <span class="accented">niskeyhens</span>, their drink offerings, from the foregoing clause, as subject to the verb of the following one, and the verb is explained by some in the sense of "mire."

The same noun may be repeated in next clause; thus, their sacrifices, or rather slaughtered meats, are unto him as bread of mourners, or, what is better, <span class="accented">their food</span> (supplied from <span class="accented">ke</span> <span class="accented">lechem</span>) <span class="accented">shall be unto them like bread of mourners</span>. Mourners' bread is that eaten at a funeral feast, or meal by persons mourning for the dead, and which was legally unclean, since a corpse defiled the house in which it was and all who entered it for seven days, as we read in <a href="../../par/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>, "This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days." Of course, all who partook of the food would be polluted; so with that of Israel in exile, being unsanctified by the offering of firstfruits. <span class="cmt_word">For their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord.</span> "Their bread for their soul," that is, for appeasing their appetite, whatsoever their soul lusted after, or bread for the preservation of their life, would not come into the house of the Lord to be sanctified by representative offerings. <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?</span> On such occasions they would feel the misery of their position most keenly. Away in a far foreign land, without temple and without ritual, they would bewail the loss of their annual celebrations, their national festivals and religious solemnities - those holiday-times of general joy and spiritual gladness.

The destruction is the desolation and wasting of their native land, because of which, or away from which and leaving it behind, they are gone. The land of their banishment was the land of their bondage. There, far from the land of their birth, they were doomed to die and to be gathered together for a common burial. Memphis was the ancient capital of Lower Egypt; its situation was on the western bank of the Nile, and south of Old Cairo. There its ruins are still seen, with extensive burial-grounds, while amid those ruins is the village of Mitrahenni. Kimchi identifies Moph with Noph. <span class="cmt_word">The pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.</span> The literal rendering of the first clause is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">their cherished delight of silver</span>.

This explanation is pretty generally accepted, and appears to us to deserve the preference. Their former homes, so pleasant and so richly decorated, were so utterly desolate and deserted that thorns and thistles overspread them. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sentence is differently translated and explained by Rosenm&uuml;ller and some others; thus: "Moph (Memphis) will bury them out of desire for their silver." This violent divulsion destroys the parallelism of the second hemistich, besides ignoring the athnach. The LXX., again <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> puzzled by the word <span class="accented">maehmad</span>, mistook it for a proper name: "Therefore, behold, they go forth from the trouble of Egypt, and Hemphis shall receive them, and Machmas (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) shall bury them." Giving a decided preference to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> (d), we have a thrilling picture of distress. First comes the destruction of their native city; having looked their last look on the ruins where once stood their home, they have set forth  - a miserable band of pilgrims - to the land of the stranger, and that stranger their conqueror and oppressor; they have reached the place of exile, there to find, not a home, but a grave, and not a single grave for each, according to the Jews' mode of sepulture to the present day, but a common place of burial into which they are huddled  together, Egypt gathering them and Memphis burying them; while in the land that gave them birth, their once happy homesteads, richly decorated and expensively adorned, are left utterly desolate - a heritage for thorns and thistles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know <i>it</i>: the prophet <i>is</i> a fool, the spiritual man <i>is</i> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - These verses describe the season and source of punishment. <span class="cmt_word">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come.</span> Commentators have appropriately compared the Vergilian "Venit summa dies, et irreluctabile tempus," equivalent to" The final day and inevitable hour is come." <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall know</span> (it): <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad</span>. Here the prophet and the man of the spirit (margin) are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the false prophets which pretended to inspiration, and flattered the people with false hopes and vain promises of safety and prosperity; and thus helped to confirm them in their sinful courses. The object of Israel's knowledge, though not introduced by <span class="accented">ki</span>, is the folly of such false prophets, and the madness of such pretenders to prophetic inspiration. That <span class="accented">ish ruach</span> may be used of a false prophet as well as of a true one is proved from <span class="accented">ish holekh ruach</span>, a man walking in the spirit, applied by <a href="../../par/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> to one of these pretenders: "If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people." Israel is doomed to know by bitter experience the folly and madness of those prophets who deceived and duped the people by lies soon detected, and their own folly and madness in giving ear to the delusive prospects they held forth. This explanation agrees with Kimchi's comment: "Then shall they confess, and say to the prophets of lies, who had led them astray, and had said to them, Peace (in time of greatest peril) - then shall they say unto them, A fool the prophet, a madman the man of spirit." The predicate precedes the subject for emphasis, and the article prefixed to the subject exhausts the class of those false prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra, Ewald, and many others understand the prophet and spiritual man to mean true prophets, which the people called fools and madmen, and treated is such, contemning and persecuting them. Thus Aben Ezra: "The days of recompense are come to you from God, who will recompense you who said to the prophet of God, He is a fool, and to the man in whom the spirit of God was, He is mad." The word me<span class="accented">shuggah</span> is properly the participle Paul used as a substantive, and kindred in meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Greek, from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be frenzied. In confirmation of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> setup. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>; and in favor of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to "And shall be afflicted," taking, according to Jerome, <span class="accented">yod</span> for <span class="accented">ray</span>, and <span class="accented">daleth</span> for <span class="accented">resh</span>; while Jerome himself translates <span class="accented">scitote</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</span> The source of all was sin. The visitation threatened, which was retributive - a recompense - was for the greatness of their iniquity. The last clause is thus dependent on and closely connected with the first, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ruling the construction first as a preposition, then as a conjunction: "And because the enmity is great." Ewald says, "If the first member states a reason (e.g. by using the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, on account of, because of, and the following infinitive), the meaning requires that, whenever a finite verb follows, the conjunction 'because' shall be employed in forming the continuation." The hatred was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that of Israel against their fellow-men, and their God or his prophetic messengers; though others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> understand it of the hatred of God against transgressors who had provoked his just indignation. The first exposition (a) suits the context, and is supported by the following verse. <span class="cmt_word">The watchman of Ephraim was with my God.</span> This rendering is manifestly inaccurate, as the first noun is in the absolute, not in the construct state; the right rendering, therefore, is either, "A watchman is Ephraim with my God;" or, "The watchman, O Ephraim, is with my God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If we adopt Aben Ezra's explanation of the prophet and spiritual man as true prophets whom the people jeeringly and scornfully called fools, fanatics, and madmen, the meaning of this clause of the next verse presents little difficulty. The prophet makes common cause with these divided prophets: his God was their God, and, however men treated them, they were under Divine protection. The sense of the <span class="accented">ira</span>, with, in this case is well given by Pusey as follows: "The true prophet was at all times <span class="accented">frith</span> God. He was <span class="accented">with</span> God, as holden by God, <span class="accented">watching</span> or looking out and on into the future by the help of God. He was <span class="accented">with</span> God, as walking with God in a constant sense of his presence, and in continual communion with him. He was with God, as associated by God with himself in teaching, warning, correcting, exhorting his people, as the apostle says, We then are workers together with him. In the next clause the false prophet is described by way of contrast as a snare. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> is properly a participle, and Ephraim is thus exhibited by the prophet as on the outlook, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> not for counsel and help beside or apart from God, as Gesenius understands it; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> as on the outlook for revelations and prophecies along with my God; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Ephraim, not satisfied with the genuine prophets, had prophets of his own, which spake to the people according to their wish. This exposition is in the main supported by Rashi and Kimchi: the former says, "They appoint for themselves prophets of their own;" and Kimchi more fully thus, "Ephraim has appointed for himself a watchman (or seer) at the side of his God; and he is the false prophet who speaks his prophecy in the name of his God." (But) <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a snare of a fowler in</span> (over) <span class="cmt_word">all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</span> Whether we adopt <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (1)</span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (2)</span> as the explanation of the first clause, we may understand the prophet of this clause as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">false</span> prophet who - by way of contrast if we accept <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, or by way of continuation if we prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (2)</span> - is like the snare of a bird-catcher over all the people's path, to entangle, entrap, and draw them into destruction <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> He is, moreover, inspired with hostility - a man of rancorous spirit against God and his true prophets. "This prophet of lies," says Aben Ezra, "is a snare of the bird-catcher." Similarly Kimchi says in his exposition, "This prophet is for Ephraim on all his ways as the snare of the bird-catcher that catcheth the fowls; so they catch Ephraim in the words of their prophets." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some understand "prophet" in the middle clause of the verse as the <span class="accented">true</span> prophet, and the snare as the hostility and traps which the people prepared for the messengers of God; so Rashi: "For the true prophets they lay snares to catch them." According to this exposition we must render, "As for the prophet, the snare of the bird-catcher is over all his ways." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> In the last clause, "house of his God," may mean the temple of the true God, or the idol-temple; thus Aben Ezra: "Enmity is in the house of his god;" while Kimchi thinks either sense admissible: "We may understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> of the house of the calves, which were his god, and the false prophet acted there as prophet, and caused enmity between himself and God; or we may explain it of the house of the true God, that is, the house of the sanctuary." Thus the hostility may refer to the prophet himself, of which he is the subject as (<span class="accented">a</span>) or the object according to Kimchi just cited, or the detestable idol-worship, or perhaps the Divine displeasure against the false prophet and the people led astray by him. <span class="cmt_word">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah.</span> The historical event here alluded to was the abominable and infamous treatment of the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah. This was the foulest blot on Israel's history during all the rule of the judges. For the loathsome particulars, <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. may be consulted. The construction is peculiar. The two verbs <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;</span> are coordinated appositionally; "The leading verb, which in meaning is the leading one, is subordinated more palpably by being placed alongside of the preceding verb without a joining <span class="accented">and"</span> (Ewald). The former verb is often constructed with an infinitive, and sometimes with a noun. Some trace the reference, as already stated, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the enormity of the men of Gibeah in relation to the Levite's concubine; others to the election of Saul, who was of Gibeah, to be king. Rashi mentions both: "Some say it was Gibeah of Benjamin in the matter of the concubine; but others say it was Gibeah of Saul, when they demanded for themselves a king and rebelled against the words of the prophet." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</span> The sin of Gibeah was fearfully avenged; its punishment re-suited in almost the total extinction of a tribe in Israel - that of Benjamin. And as Israel had paralleled that of the men of Gibeah, he gives them to understand first implicitly that like punishment would overtake them, then he explicitly denounces visitation for their iniquity and retribution for their sin. The clause thus closes, as it commenced, with the sad note of coming calamity.

There are three possible constructions of <span class="accented">bammidhbor</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with "found," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with "grapes," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> with both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to the first, which, on the whole, seems preferable, the meaning is, "I found Israel of old as a man finds grapes in a desert;" and the sense is God's good will towards and delight in Israel. Grapes found by a weary, exhausted traveler in a wilderness are a real boon, refreshing and strengthening him for continuing his journey and reaching his destination. Rashi gives the sense clearly and concisely thus: "As gropes which are precious and delicious in a desert, even so have I loved Israel." Aben Ezra, in his exposition, refers to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>, "He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye;" and then adds, "As grapes in a wilderness where no one dwells; every one that finds them rejoices in them, and so in the first-ripe figs." The comment of Kimchi is fuller and more satisfactory: "As a man, when he finds grapes in the wilderness which is dry and fruitless, rejoices over them; and as he rejoices when he finds a first-fruit in the fig tree in its beginning; even so have I found Israel in the wilderness, and fed them and nourished them: they lacked nothing, equally as if they had been in an inhabited land; but they have not recognized my goodness." As the fig harvest is rather late in Palestine - about the middle of August - early figs have special worth, and are regarded as a delicacy. The comparison then is, according to Rashi, with the "early fig on the fig tree, which is ripe; like the fig on the fig tree in its beginning, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in the beginning of the ripening of the figs;" then he subjoins, "Even so did your fathers appear in my eyes, that I loved them." <span class="cmt_word">But they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto that shame.</span> Israel did not continue long in a condition so pleasing to God, but fell away from him, forgot his benefits, and turned aside to the abominable idols of the surrounding Gentiles. As Aben Ezra somewhat pathetically expresses it, "Yet my joy was only small and of short duration, for they did homage to Baal-peor, and separated themselves from me." <span class="accented">Long</span>, therefore, before the sin of Gibeah they transgressed in Baal-poor; in the early period of their history they apostatized and proved unfaithful to Jehovah. To this hideous god, corresponding to Priapus of the Greeks, the maidens of Moab sacrificed their virginity. The Israelites were designed to be Nazarites, that is, separated to Jehovah and consecrated to his service, but they separated themselves unto that shame, either the idol or his worship. <span class="cmt_word">And their abominations were according as they loved.</span> If men are slaves to appetite, they make a god of their belly; if to lust, Baal-peor is their god; and men become like what they worship, and abominable as the idols they serve, as the psalmist says, "They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them." They "became abominations like their lover" (<span class="accented">ohabh</span>, paramour; namely, Baal-peor), that is, as abominable and loathsome in the sight of God as the idols which they adulterously worshipped. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As for</i> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14.</span> - Having referred to the most flagrant instances of Israel's transgressions in the past - Gibeah in the time of the judges, Baal-peor at a still earlier period even in the days of Moses, and having merely indicated the parallel between their present sin and previous enormities, the prophet proceeds to denounce the punishments deserved and ready to descend upon them. <span class="cmt_word">As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</span> The greatest glory, perhaps, of Ephraim was their fruitfulness - "double fruitfulness" being the very meaning of the name and the multiplication of their numbers; now that glory of populousness was to vanish speedily and entirely, like birds winging their way swiftly and out of sight. After the figure comes the fact, and it is expressed in anti-climactic form - no child-bearing, no pregnancy, no conception. The course of barrenness takes the place of the blessing of fruitfulness. Though they bring up their children, yet will I believe them, that there shall not be a man left. Even if their sons should grow up to manhood and attain maturity, yet they would be cut off by the sword and swept away by death, so that their progeny would perish. This accords with the threatened punishment of unfaithfulness recorded in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>, "The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of grey hairs." The negative sense of rain, equivalent to "so that <span class="accented">not</span>," <span class="accented">is</span> common before verbs, also before nouns the <span class="accented">min</span> being put for the fuller <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</span> This accounts for the coming calamity; it is the departure of Jehovah from Israel, and the withdrawal of his favor. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> stands for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, sin and <span class="accented">samech</span> being interchanged; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may be for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">sin</span> put for <span class="accented">shin</span> by a clerical error. The meaning is a little different: "when I look away from them." Rashi mentions the fact that this word belongs to those words written with <span class="accented">sin</span> but read with <span class="accented">samech</span>. His comment on the verse is correct: "For what benefit have they when they bring up their children? Because, if they do bring them up, then I bereave them so that they do not become men;" similarly Kimchi: "If there be some among them who escape these mishaps and reach the birth, and they (the parents) bring them up yet shall they die in youth, and never reach the season when they shall be called men." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The misreading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> by the LXX. led to the strange misrendering, "Wherefore also there is a woe to them (though) my flesh is of them (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>,) of which Cyril connects the first member with the preceding words, and, detaching the remainder, interpreted, "Let my flesh be far for exemption from the punishment threatened. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer</span>. The first member of this verse has called forth great diversity of translation and interpretation. It were tedious, and not conducive to the right understanding of the verse, to enumerate the various expositions given of it. A <span class="accented">very</span> few of the most important may be briefly noticed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, rendered, "Ephraim, even as I saw, gave her children for a <span class="accented">prey</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald, conjecturing <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, renders," Ephraim is, as I judge, according to the <span class="accented">form</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> planting in a meadow." Rejecting both these, we come <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to that of Gesenius: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span>, like Tyro (as if it were Tyro), is planted in a beautiful meadow;" De Wette's is," Ephraim, when (or if) I look as far as Tyro, is planted on a pleasant meadow;" Keil has, "Ephraim, as I selected it for a Tyro planted in the valley; so shall Ephraim lead out its <span class="accented">sons</span> to the <span class="accented">murderer</span>." All these renderings are faulty in one respect or other; some of them miss the sense altogether, and others of them obscure it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The rendering that appears to us simplest, most in harmony with the Hebrew, and most suitable to the context, is that of Wunshe, but with a modification that of a secure dwelling-place instead of meadow: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span>, as I look towards Tyro, is planted on a meadow [rather, '<span class="accented">sure</span> resting-place'], and Ephraim must lead out its sons to the murderer." The meaning, then, is that Ephraim is a lovely land in whatever direction one looks towards it, like the famous Tyro; it was beautiful and blooming, populous as well as pleasant; or rather, strong in its natural fortifications, like the famous capital of Phoenicia; yet the wrath of Heaven hung over it - it would become waste and emptied of its male population, Ephraim being obliged to send forth the bravest of her sons to repel the hostile invader, and to perish in the tumult of the battle. By combining a part of Rashi's exposition with part of Kimchi's, we reach the correct <span class="accented">sense</span>. Rashi has, "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span> as I look towards Tyro, which in its prosperity is crowned above all cities, so I look upon Ephraim planted on a meadow;" so far the explanation is correct, not so what follow: "And Ephraim - how does he reward me? He is busied in bringing forth his <span class="accented">sons to</span> the murderer in order to sacrifice them to idols;" in place of this latter part we substitute the following of Kimchi: "<span class="accented">The</span> enemies shall come upon them, and they shall march out from their cities to meet them in battle, and the enemies shall slay them." The infinitive with <span class="accented">le</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, implies the necessity imposed on Ephraim to do so. Ephraim is to had out, or <span class="accented">must</span> lead out, his <span class="accented">sons to</span> the murderer. Rosenm&uuml;ller, in his commentary, has the following remark on this idiom at the fifteenth verse of the forty-ninth psalm: "Tempus infinitivum positum <span class="accented">esse fututri</span> sire aoristi, vice, pro eo quod plenum esset <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span>   =   paratus <span class="accented">est</span>," etc. He adds that the Syriac prefixes <span class="accented">arid</span>, equivalent to paratus est to the infinitive with <span class="accented">lomad</span>, and so makes a paraphrase of the future; while the Hebrews omit <span class="accented">arid</span>. Driver ('Hebrew Tenses,' p. 300) says of this usage of the so-called "periphrastic future," "Hero the infinitive with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, expressing as usual a direction, tendency, or aim, forms the sole predicate: the subject, as a rule, stands first, so as to engage the mind, the purpose which is postulated for it follows; and thus the idea arises of an inevitable sequence or obligation , though net one of a formal or pronounced character, which is expressed in Hebrew by other means (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by the addition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, or of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, equivalent to 'incumbent upon me'); <a href="../../par/hosea/9-13.htm">Hosea 9:13</a>, 'And Ephraim <span class="accented">is for bringing forth</span> his sons to the slayer;' or, as this is the entire scope and object in regard to which Ephraim is here considered  <span class="accented">- is to</span> or <span class="accented">must</span> bring forth." Give them, O Lord: what writ thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. The prophet seems at a loss to know what he should ask for his countrymen. Though it was not total excision, but rather diminution of numbers, that was threatened in accordance with the statement, "<span class="accented">If</span> thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this Law... ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;" yet at every stage their offspring was to be cut off, or, if spared to arrive at manhood, it was only to fall by the hand of the murderer. No wonder, then, the prophet is perplexed in regard to the petition that would be most expedient for them. He hardly knew what was best to ask on their behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The thought at length flashed upon him that utter childishness was preferable to bringing up children to be slain with the sword or trained in idolatry; hence he prayed for what he regarded as the less calamity - "a miscarrying womb and dry breasts." Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the prophet is agitated between compassion for his countrymen and indignation at their sin. Justly indignant at the heinousness of their iniquity, he is about to appeal to Heaven for vengeance on the transgressors, but in pity for the erring people he cheeks the half-uttered imprecation, or softens it into the milder request for their extinction by <span class="accented">childlessness</span>.

Gilgal had been the scene of many mercies; there the rite of circumcision, the seal of the Abrahamic covenant, after its omission dining the sojourn in the wilderness, was renewed; there the Passover, also intermitted from its second observance at Sinai, was kept; there the twelve memorial stones had been set up; there the Captain of the host of the Lord had appeared to Joshua, reassuring him of Divine protection; there the tabernacle had stood before its removal to Shiloh; yet that very place - a place of such blessing and solemn covenanting-had become the scene of idolatry and iniquity. The wickedness of Israel had been concentrated there as in a focus; there Israel's rejection of the theocracy in its spiritual form had taken place; there that first-plague's pot of ruin had been contracted; there the calf-worship had been developed; there the form of civil government had been shaped according to their own erring fancy, and their mode of religious worship had been corrupted. Thus Gilgal had become the center of all their sin; but the scene of mercy became the source of wrath, for there God's fatherly love was turned by Israel's wickedness into hatred. <span class="cmt_word">For the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more.</span> They were driven out like Hagar out of the house of the patriarch, that Ishmael might not inherit with Isaac; like an unfaithful wife divorced and driven out of the house of the husband whom she has dishonored; or like an undutiful and disobedient son whom his father has disinherited. Further, God disowns the rebellious son, and acknowledges the paternal relationship no longer. The princes of Israel had become rebellions and stubborn: by an impressive Hebrew paronomasia, their <span class="accented">sarim</span>, rulers, had become <span class="accented">sorerim</span>, revolters. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit.</span> Ephraim is a pleasant plant, but a worm has smitten the root and it has withered; Ephraim is a goodly tree, but the lightning of heaven has scorched and dried it up; there may be leafage for a time, but no fruitage ever. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.</span> The desires  - margin, <span class="accented">dear delights</span>, or, <span class="accented">darlings - perish</span>, and so the figure is now dropped, and the fact is seen in all its severe and stern reality, while the dread denunciation of vers. 11 and 12 is repeated and emphasized. <span class="cmt_word">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span> The prophet submits his will to the Divine will, and acquiesces in the disposals of his providence, and in his own proper person predicts Israel's coming doom. He fills up the outline of the dark picture by stating the cause of their rejection. He specifies at the same time the character of rejection, namely, dispersion among the nations, like birds driven from their nest, for so the term <span class="accented">nodedim</span> denotes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
