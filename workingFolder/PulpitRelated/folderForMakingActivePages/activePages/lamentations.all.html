The characteristic introductory word of an elegy (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4, 12</a>), and adopted by the early Jewish divines as the title of the Book of Lamentations. It is repeated at the opening of ch. 2 and ch. 4. <span class="cmt_word">Sit solitary.</span> Jerusalem is poetically personified and distinguished from the persons who accidentally compose her population. She is "solitary," not as having retired into solitude, but as deserted by her inhabitants (same word as in first clause of <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">How is she become as a widow!</span> etc. Rather, <span class="accented">She is become a widow that was great among the nations; a princess among the provinces, she is become a vassal.</span> The alteration greatly conduces to the effect of the verse, which consists of three parallel lines, like almost all the rest of the chapter. We are not to press the phrase, "a widow," as if some. earthly or heavenly husband were alluded to; it is a kind of symbol of desolation and misery (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>). "The provinces" at once suggests the period of the writer, who must have been a subject of the Babylonian empire. The term is also frequently used of the countries under the Persian rule (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1, 22</a>), and in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a> is used of Judah itself. Here, however, the "provinces," like the "nations," must be the countries formerly subject to David and Solomon (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears <i>are</i> on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort <i>her</i>: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the night.</span> Not only by day, but even in the season of rest and unconsciousness. <span class="cmt_word">Her lovers...  her friends;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the neighbouring peoples, with which Judah had formed alliances, such as Egypt (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>), Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>). This is a favourite phrase of Jeremiah's (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>), but also of Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 7, 10, 12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:33, 36, 37; 23:5, 9, 22). The national God was conceived of as the Husband of the nation; and the prophets retained this idea and elevated it, just as they did circumcision and many other Eastern traditions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is gone into captivity because of affliction;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is gone into exile</span>, etc. The poet is not thinking of the deportation of the captives, but of those Jews who sought refuge for themselves in foreign lands (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). An objection has been raised to this view that the number of fugitive Jews would not be large enough to warrant their being called "Judah." But we might almost as well object on a similar ground to the application of the term "Judah" to the Jews who were carried to Babylon. The truth may, perhaps, be that, after the fall of Jerusalem, the Jewish nation became split up into three parts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews who succeeded in escaping into Egypt or elsewhere; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those who were carried captive; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the mass of the common people, who remained on their native soil, Keil, however, retains the view of the Authorized Version, only substituting  "out of" for "because of." "Out of" the misery into which the Jews had been brought by the invasions of Necho and Nebuchadnezzar they passed into the new misery of captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Among the heathen;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among the nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Between the straits.</span> The phrase is peculiar, and reminds us of <a href="../../par/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, "Out of the strait I called unto thee." "A strait," or narrow place, clearly means adversity, just as "a large place" (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>) means prosperity.

The reads leading to Jerusalem, usually so thronged with pilgrims, are desolate and "mourn" (comp. ch. 2:8 and <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All her gates are desolate.</span> No one goes in or out of Jerusalem, and there is no concourse of citizens in the shady recess of the gates. <span class="cmt_word">The virgins are afflicted.</span> So <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-18.htm">Zephaniah 3:18</a>. The sorrow was on account of the cessation of the festival, in the music of which they took a leading part (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are the chief;</span> rather, <span class="accented">are become the head.</span> Comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Deuteronomy 28:44</a>, where, as a part of the curse of Israel's rebellion, it is foretold that "he [the stranger] shall become the head, and thou shalt become the tail." <span class="cmt_word">Before the enemy.</span> Like a herd of cattle.

An allusion to the attempted flight of Zedekiah and his companions (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4, 5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-7.htm">Lamentations 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, <i>and</i> did mock at her sabbaths.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remembered;</span> rather, <span class="accented">remembereth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Miseries</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore she is removed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she is become an abomination</span> (literally, <span class="accented">an impurity</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>). The poet leaves out the preliminary clause, "therefore she is grievously punished." It was the humiliation of Jerusalem, rather than her sin, which brought upon her the contempt of her neighbours. The destruction of a city is often compared to the ill treatment of a defenceless woman (<a href="../../par/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Her filthiness <i>is</i> in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter.

Some think that this verse relates solely to the miserable survivors. This is possible; at any rate, it includes the contemporaries of the writer. "Sigh" and "seek" are participles in the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">To relieve the soul;</span> literally, to <span class="accented">bring back the soul.</span> The "soul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the principle of life, is conceived of as having for a time deserted the fainting frame. <span class="cmt_word">See, O Lord,</span> etc. Another piteous cry of Jerusalem, preparing the way for the second half of the elegy.

Keil, however, adopts a rendering very near that of the Authorized Version "(Cometh it) not unto you?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Do ye not heed it?" Ewald supposes the phrase to be abbreviated from "Do I not call unto you?" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a>); but this would be a very harsh construction. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>; the Targum, "I adjure you;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">O vos</span>; - all apparently pronouncing <span class="accented">lu</span> instead of <span class="accented">lo</span>.

But, though Ewald also adopts this view, it seems to limit unduly the meaning of the poet. By "tent" we should probably understand "dwelling," as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, and often; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>, "the tent of David;" <a href="../../par/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>, "the tent of Joseph." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/2-5.htm">Lamentations 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was as an enemy: he hath swallowed,</span> etc. The threefold division of the verse is, unfortunately, concealed in the Authorized Version, owing to the arbitrary stopping. The grouping suggested by the Massoretic text is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The Lord is become an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel;<br />He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed all his strongholds;<br />And hath increased in the daughter of Judah moaning and bemoaning."</span> The change of gender in the second line is easily explicable. In the first case the poet is thinking of the city; in the second, of the people of Israel. The rendering "moaning and bemoaning" is designed to reproduce, to some extent, the Hebrew phrase, in which two words, derived from the same root, and almost exactly the same, are placed side by side, to give a more intense expression to the idea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <i>if it were of</i> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violently taken away;</span> rather, <span class="accented">violently treated; i.e.</span> broken up. <span class="cmt_word">His tabarnacle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his booth.</span> "Tent" and "dwelling" are interchangeable expressions (see ver. 4); and in the Psalms "booth" is used as a special poetic synonym for tent when God's earthly dwelling place, the sanctuary of the temple, is spoken of (so <a href="../../par/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>). The Authorized Version, indeed, presumes an allusion to the proper meaning of the Hebrew word, as if the poet compared the sanctuary of Jehovah to a pleasure booth in a garden. It is, however, more natural to continue, <span class="accented">as a garden</span>, the sense of which will be clear from <a href="../../par/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12, 13</a>. The Septuagint has, instead, "as a vine" - a reading which differs from the Massoretic by having one letter more (<span class="accented">kaggefen</span> instead of <span class="accented">kaggan</span>). This ancient reading is adopted by Ewald, and harmonizes well with <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>); but the received text gives a very good sense. "Garden" in the Bible means, of course, a plantation of trees rather than a flower garden. <span class="cmt_word">His places of the assembly;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his place of meeting</span> (<span class="accented">with God</span>). The  word occurs in the same sense in <a href="../../par/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a>. It is the temple which is meant, and the term is borrowed from the famous phrase, <span class="accented">ohel mo'edh</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; comp. 25:22).

The Jewish rabbi commonly called Rashi thinks that a historical fact is preserved in these words, and that the Jewish exiles were really obliged to eat bread mixed with grit, because they had to bake in pits dug in the ground.

In the next verse we read, "This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope," which seems inconsistent with ver. 20 as given in the Authorized Version.

The Peshito (Syriac) has, "Remember, and revive [literally, 'cause to return'] my soul within me," which involves a slightly different reading of one word. But more tempting than any other view of the meaning is that of Bickell, though it involves a correction and an insertion, "My soul remembereth well and meditateth on thy faithfulness."

Others suppose that "this" refers to the following verses; but in this case a new section would begin in the middle of a triad (the triad of verses beginning with <span class="accented">zayin</span>), which is certainly improbable.

Youth is mentioned as the time when it is easier to adapt one's self to circumstances, and when discipline is most readily accepted. The words do not prove that the writer is young, any more than vers. 9 and  100 of <a href="../../par/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. prove that the psalmist was an aged man (against this view, see vers. 84-87). There is no occasion, therefore, for the textual alteration (for as such I cannot help regarding it), "from his youth," found in some Hebrew manuscripts in Theodotion, in the Aldine edition of the Septuagint, and in the Vulgate. The reading was probably dictated by the unconscious endeavour to prop up the theory of Jeremiah's authorship. The scribes and translators remembered, inopportunely, that the trials of Jeremiah began in early manhood.

Not that the latter part of this description can have corresponded to literal fact. None of the hallowed jewels would have been treated with such indifference. The expression must be as figurative as the parallel one, "to cast pearls before swine," in <a href="../../par/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>. The precious stones are the "sons of Zion," who are compared to "fine gold" in ver. 2, precisely as they are in <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a> (comp. ver. 13," Thy sons, O Zion") to "the stones of a crown." They are called "stones of the sanctuary," in allusion, perhaps, to the precious stones employed in the decoration of the temple according to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>. But we may also translate <span class="accented">hallowed stones</span>, which better suits the figurative use of the phrase. Those, however, who adopt the literal interpretation, explain "the stones of the sanctuary" of the hewn stones of the fabric of the temple, which are described as "costly" in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>. But how can even a poet have represented the enemy as carrying these stones out and throwing them down in the street? On the other hand, in an earlier lamentation we are expressly told that the young children "fainted for hunger in the top of every street" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>).

She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers." The description is literally true, if we add a detail not mentioned by the sacred poet. The eggs destined for hatching are deposited in a nest hole scratched in the sand, but there are other eggs laid, not in the sand, but near it, to all appearance forsaken. These eggs, however, are not exposed in simple stupidity, though they do often fall victims to violence. "They are intended for the nourishment of the newly hatched young ones, which in barren districts would at first find difficulty in procuring food" (Houghton, 'Natural History of the Ancients,' p. 198).

How is the language of the second part to be accounted for? It will help us to an answer if we observe that the later Jews seem to have acquired an exorbitant confidence in their national future ever since the Book of Deuteronomy had become as it were canonical in the reign of Josiah. "The temple of Jehovah" was ever in their mouths (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>), and the strong outward regard paid to the directions of the Law seemed to them to justify their believing in the fulfilment of its promises. And, in fact, the grand deliverance of Jerusalem in the reign of Hezekiah might, even without this misunderstanding of Deuteronomy, have inspired a firm faith in the security of Jerusalem. A sacred poet had already, on the occasion of that deliverance, declared of the holy city that "God upholdeth the same forever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>), and also (in vers. 4, 5) used the same hyperbole as the author of this lamentation to express the wide reaching interest felt in the fortunes of Jerusalem.

But we are nowhere else told that the spiritual leaders of the people, in these closing years of the Jewish state, were guilty of shedding innocent blood, unless this is to be inferred from the incident related in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>, etc.

The latter view seems the more probable. <span class="cmt_word">They have polluted themselves,</span> etc. Their acts of violence have been continued to the very end of their term of power.

There may be an allusion to this, but, though commonly accepted, the view is not certain, as the" leper" in the present case is not the person who raises the cry, but those who meet him. <span class="cmt_word">When they fled away and wandered.</span> The clause is difficult. If the text is correct, Keil's explanation may perhaps pass, "When they fled away, (there) also they wandered," alluding to the "wandering" ascribed to them with a somewhat different shade of meaning in the preceding verso. In any case there ought to be a fuller stop than a comma after "touch not," which words close the first of the two parallel lines of which the verse consists. But very probably "when" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ki</span>) is an intrusion, and we should begin the second line thus: "They fled, they also wandered about." <span class="cmt_word">They said among the heathen,</span> etc. Even in their place of exile they found no rest (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>).

The Chaldeans were either within the city or without. If within, they would not need literally to "hunt the steps" of the Jews; if without, they had not war engines adequate to shooting the inhabitants at some distance.

Most of all among the Egyptians; but, even in imperial Rome, we find Seneca ('De Clementia,' 1:4, quoted by Archbishop Seeker, in Blayney) declaring, "Ille (Princeps) est spiritus vitalis, quem haec tot millia (civium) trahunt."

The objection to it is forcibly expressed by Job (<a href="../../par/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), "God [it is said] layeth up his iniquity for his children: [but] let him requite it to himself, that he may feel it!" Hence Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-1.htm">Ezekiel 18:1</a>, etc.) insist on the truth that every man is punished for his own sins. Of course the two views of punishment are reconcilable. The Jews were not only punished, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11, 12</a>, for their fathers' sins, but for their own still more flagrant offences.

Dr. Thomson "cannot recall an instance in which men were grinding at the mill" ('The Land and the Book,' edit. 1881, p. 108), and both <a href="../../par/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a> presuppose that it was women's work.

The poet does not say," Wherefore hast thou forgotten us?" One of the psalmists, indeed, does go so far (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>); but the poet of this lamentation, with a more tender and trustful reserve, adopts the tense of feeling (the imperfect) in preference to that of fact (the perfect), and asks, "Wherefore dost thou [to my feeling] forget us? Wherefore, if Jehovah's power is still unbroken, does he allow Israel to feel herself forsaken?" The fact is certain, viz. that the land of Israel is desolate, and (the poet seems to imply) desolate for some time already. The interpretation is hypothetical, and, as the last verse will show, the poet cannot bring himself to believe that it can be accurate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-21.htm">Lamentations 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn thou us,</span> etc. Not "bring us back to thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the sacred land (as Thenius), for it is not a speech of the exiles, but of the Jews left behind, at least for the present, in Judea. "Turn thou us" means "Bring us into a state of reconciliation with thee" The next petition, <span class="cmt_word">Renew our days as of old,</span> means, "Restore the old happy mode of life, each man with his own vine and his own fig tree, undisturbed by the fear of invasion, and rejoicing in the sense of the favour of Jehovah." The first petition has the priority because only on repentance and recovered purity of heart and life can Jerusalem rise from her ashes. Isaiah had said this long ago (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26, 27</a>), and the elegiac poet repeats it (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/5-22.htm">Lamentations 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unless</span>. The poet wishes to suggest that the idea seems to him inconsistent with the covenant relationship of Jehovah towards Israel. May we not compare a striking passage in Isaiah which should probably be rendered thus: "A wife of one's youth, can she be rejected? saith thy God" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>)? Both passages express, in a most delicate way, the incredulity of the writers with regard to the absolute rejection of Israel. And thus this melancholy Book of Lamentations concludes with a hope, "faint, yet pursuing," of the final realization of the promises to Israel. The interpretation adopted admits of no reasonable doubt, in spite of the fact that ancient doctors of the synagogue thought otherwise when they established the custom of repeating ver. 21 after ver. 22 had been read, in order to soften the supposed gloomy impression of ver. 22. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../lamentations/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Lamentations 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Lamentations 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
